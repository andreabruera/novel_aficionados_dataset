<p/>Chapter I. Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov was the third son of Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, a land owner well known in our district in his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) own day, and still remembered among us owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) gloomy and tragic death, which happened thirteen years ago, and which I shall describe in its proper place.
<p/>For the present I will only say that this <div class="bookquote">``landowner'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--for so we used to call him (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>), although he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) hardly spent a day of his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) life on his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) own estate--was a strange type, yet one pretty frequently to be met with, a type abject and vicious and at the same time senseless.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) was one of those senseless persons who are very well capable of looking after their worldly affairs, and, apparently, after nothing else.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch, for instance, began with next to nothing; his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) estate was of the smallest; he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) ran to dine at other men's tables, and fastened on them as a toady, yet at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) death it appeared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had a hundred thousand roubles in hard cash.
<p/>Ilusha's Funeral. The Speech At The Stone Footnotes PART I Book I. The History Of A Family At the same time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was all his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) life one of the most senseless, fantastical fellows in the whole district.
<p/>I repeat, it was not stupidity--the majority of these fantastical fellows are shrewd and intelligent enough--but just senselessness, and a peculiar national form of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was married twice, and had three sons, the eldest, Dmitri, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) first wife, and two, Ivan and Alexey, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) second.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch's first wife, Adelaďda Ivanovna, belonged to a fairly rich and distinguished noble family, also landowners in our district, the Miüsovs.
<p/>How it came to pass that an heiress, who was also a beauty, and moreover one of those vigorous, intelligent girls, so common in this generation, but sometimes also to be found in the last, could have married such a worthless, puny weakling, as we all called him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), I won't attempt to explain.
<p/>I knew a young lady of the last <div class="bookquote">``romantic''  (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div>generation who after some years of an enigmatic passion for a gentleman, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might quite easily have married at any moment, invented insuperable obstacles to their union, and ended by throwing herself one stormy night into a rather deep and rapid river from a high bank, almost a precipice, and so perished, entirely to satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own caprice, and to be like Shakespeare's Ophelia.
<p/>Indeed, if this precipice, a chosen and favorite spot of hers, had been less picturesque, if there had been a prosaic flat bank in its place, most likely the suicide would never have taken place.
<p/>This is a fact, and probably there have been not a few similar instances in the last two or three generations.
<p/>Adelaďda Ivanovna Miüsov's action was similarly, no doubt, an echo of other people's ideas, and was due to the irritation caused by lack of mental freedom.
<p/>And a pliable imagination persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>generations</b></font>), we must suppose, for a brief moment, that Fyodor Pavlovitch, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) parasitic position, was one of the bold and ironical spirits of that progressive epoch, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was, in fact, an ill-natured buffoon and nothing more.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>generations</b></font>) wanted, perhaps, to show her (<font color='blue'><b>generations</b></font>) feminine independence, to override class distinctions and the despotism of her (<font color='blue'><b>generations</b></font>) family. What gave the marriage piquancy was that it was preceded by an elopement, and this greatly captivated Adelaďda Ivanovna's fancy.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch's position at the time made him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) specially eager for any such enterprise, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was passionately anxious to make a career in one way or another.
<p/>As for mutual love it did not exist apparently, either in the bride or in him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), in spite of Adelaďda Ivanovna's beauty.
<p/>This was, perhaps, a unique case of the kind in the life of Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was always of a voluptuous temper, and ready to run after any petticoat on the slightest encouragement.
<p/>To attach himself to a good family and obtain a dowry was an alluring prospect. She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) seems to have been the only woman who made no particular appeal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) senses.
<p/>Immediately after the elopement Adelaďda Ivanovna discerned in a flash that she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had no feeling for her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) husband but contempt. The marriage accordingly showed itself in its true colors with extraordinary rapidity.
<p/>Although the family accepted the event pretty quickly and apportioned the runaway bride her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) dowry, the husband and wife began to lead a most disorderly life, and there were everlasting scenes between them.
<p/>It was said that the young wife showed incomparably more generosity and dignity than Fyodor Pavlovitch, who, as is now known, got hold of all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) money up to twenty-five thousand roubles as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) received it, so that those thousands were lost to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for ever.
<p/>The little village and the rather fine town house which formed part of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dowry he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) utmost for a long time to transfer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) name, by means of some deed of conveyance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) would probably have succeeded, merely from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) moral fatigue and desire to get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), and from the contempt and loathing he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) aroused by his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) persistent and shameless importunity.
<p/>It is known for a fact that frequent fights took place between the husband and wife, but rumor had it that Fyodor Pavlovitch did not beat his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) wife but was beaten by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a hot-tempered, bold, dark-browed, impatient woman, possessed of remarkable physical strength.
<p/>Finally, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) left the house and ran away from Fyodor Pavlovitch with a destitute divinity student, leaving Mitya, a child of three years old, in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's hands.
<p/>But, fortunately, Adelaďda Ivanovna's family intervened and circumvented his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) greediness. Immediately Fyodor Pavlovitch introduced a regular harem into the house, and abandoned himself to orgies of drunkenness.
<p/>In the intervals he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) used to drive all over the province, complaining tearfully to each and all of Adelaďda Ivanovna's having left him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), going into details too disgraceful for a husband to mention in regard to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own married life.
<p/>What seemed to gratify him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and flatter his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) self-love most was to play the ridiculous part of the injured husband, and to parade his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) woes with embellishments.
<p/>One would think that you'd got a promotion, Fyodor Pavlovitch, you seem so pleased in spite of your sorrow,'' scoffers said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Many even added that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was glad of a new comic part in which to play the buffoon, and that it was simply to make it funnier that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) pretended to be unaware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) ludicrous position.
<p/>'' But, who knows, it may have been simplicity. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) succeeded in getting on the track of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) runaway wife.
<p/>The poor woman turned out to be in Petersburg, where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had gone with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) divinity student, and where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had thrown herself into a life of complete emancipation.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch at once began bustling about, making preparations to go to Petersburg, with what object he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) could not himself have said.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) would perhaps have really gone; but having determined to do so he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) felt at once entitled to fortify himself for the journey by another bout of reckless drinking.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had died quite suddenly in a garret, according to one story, of typhus, or as another version had it, of starvation.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) wife's death, and the story is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) ran out into the street and began shouting with joy, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) hands to Heaven: <div class="bookquote">``Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but others say he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) wept without restraint like a little child, so much so that people were sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), in spite of the repulsion he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) inspired.
<p/>It is quite possible that both versions were true, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) rejoiced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) release, and at the same time wept for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) who released him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>).
<p/>And just at that time his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) wife's family received the news of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) death in Petersburg. As a general rule, people, even the wicked, are much more naďve and simple-hearted than we suppose.
<p/>And we ourselves are, too. Chapter II. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) Gets Rid Of His (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) Eldest Son You can easily imagine what a father such a man could be and how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would bring up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) children.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) completely abandoned the child of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) marriage with Adelaďda Ivanovna, not from malice, nor because of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) matrimonial grievances, but simply because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forgot him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was wearying every one with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tears and complaints, and turning his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house into a sink of debauchery, a faithful servant of the family, Grigory, took the three-year-old Mitya into his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) care.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) behavior as a father was exactly what might be expected. If he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) hadn't looked after him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) there would have been no one even to change the baby's little shirt.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) grandfather was no longer living, his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) widow, Mitya's grandmother, had moved to Moscow, and was seriously ill, while his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) daughters were married, so that Mitya remained for almost a whole year in old Grigory's charge and lived with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) in the servant's cottage.
<p/>But if his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father had remembered him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) could not, indeed, have been altogether unaware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) existence-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would have sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) back to the cottage, as the child would only have been in the way of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) debaucheries.
<p/>It happened moreover that the child's relations on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mother's side forgot him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) too at first. But a cousin of Mitya's mother, Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, happened to return from Paris.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) lived for many years afterwards abroad, but was at that time quite a young man, and distinguished among the Miüsovs as a man of enlightened ideas and of European culture, who had been in the capitals and abroad.
<p/>In the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) career he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come into contact with many of the most Liberal men of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) epoch, both in Russia and abroad.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had known Proudhon and Bakunin personally, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) declining years was very fond of describing the three days of the Paris Revolution of February 1848, hinting that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself had almost taken part in the fighting on the barricades.
<p/>Towards the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became a Liberal of the type common in the forties and fifties. This was one of the most grateful recollections of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) youth.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) splendid estate lay on the outskirts of our little town and bordered on the lands of our famous monastery, with which Pyotr Alexandrovitch began an endless lawsuit, almost as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came into the estate, concerning the rights of fishing in the river or wood-cutting in the forest, I don't know exactly which.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) regarded it as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty as a citizen and a man of culture to open an attack upon the <div class="bookquote">``clericals.
<p/>Hearing all about Adelaďda Ivanovna, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), of course, remembered, and in whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had at one time been interested, and learning of the existence of Mitya, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) intervened, in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) youthful indignation and contempt for Fyodor Pavlovitch.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) made the latter's acquaintance for the first time, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) directly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wished to undertake the child's education.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) used long afterwards to tell as a characteristic touch, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) began to speak of Mitya, Fyodor Pavlovitch looked for some time as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) did not understand what child he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was talking about, and even as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was surprised to hear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had a little son in the house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had an independent property of about a thousand souls, to reckon in the old style. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>The story may have been exaggerated, yet it must have been something like the truth.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch was all his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) life fond of acting, of suddenly playing an unexpected part, sometimes without any motive for doing so, and even to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) own direct disadvantage, as, for instance, in the present case.
<p/>This habit, however, is characteristic of a very great number of people, some of them very clever ones, not like Fyodor Pavlovitch.
<p/>Pyotr Alexandrovitch carried the business through vigorously, and was appointed, with Fyodor Pavlovitch, joint guardian of the child, who had a small property, a house and land, left him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) mother.
<p/>Mitya did, in fact, pass into this cousin's keeping, but as the latter had no family of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) own, and after securing the revenues of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) estates was in haste to return at once to Paris, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) left the boy in charge of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cousins, a lady living in Moscow.
<p/>It came to pass that, settling permanently in Paris he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), too, forgot the child, especially when the Revolution of February broke out, making an impression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) remembered all the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) life.
<p/>The Moscow lady died, and Mitya passed into the care of one of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) married daughters. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) home a fourth time later on.
<p/>I won't enlarge upon that now, as I shall have much to tell later of Fyodor Pavlovitch's firstborn, and must confine myself now to the most essential facts about him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), without which I could not begin my story.
<p/>In the first place, this Mitya, or rather Dmitri Fyodorovitch, was the only one of Fyodor Pavlovitch's three sons who grew up in the belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had property, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) would be independent on coming of age.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) did not finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) studies at the gymnasium, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) got into a military school, then went to the Caucasus, was promoted, fought a duel, and was degraded to the ranks, earned promotion again, led a wild life, and spent a good deal of money.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) did not begin to receive any income from Fyodor Pavlovitch until he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) came of age, and until then got into debt.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) saw and knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) father, Fyodor Pavlovitch, for the first time on coming of age, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) visited our neighborhood on purpose to settle with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) property.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) did not stay long with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), and made haste to get away, having only succeeded in obtaining a sum of money, and entering into an agreement for future payments from the estate, of the revenues and value of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was unable -LRB-a fact worthy of note-RRB-, upon this occasion, to get a statement from his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) father.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch remarked for the first time then -LRB-this, too, should be noted-RRB- that Mitya had a vague and exaggerated idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) property.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) spent an irregular boyhood and youth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seems not to have liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father. Fyodor Pavlovitch was very well satisfied with this, as it fell in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) own designs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) gathered only that the young man was frivolous, unruly, of violent passions, impatient, and dissipated, and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) could only obtain ready money he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) would be satisfied, although only, of course, for a short time.
<p/>In the end, when four years later, Mitya, losing patience, came a second time to our little town to settle up once for all with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father, it turned out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) amazement that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had nothing, that it was difficult to get an account even, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had received the whole value of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) property in sums of money from Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was perhaps even in debt to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), that by various agreements into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) own desire, entered at various previous dates, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had no right to expect anything more, and so on, and so on.
<p/>So Fyodor Pavlovitch began to take advantage of this fact, sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) from time to time small doles, installments. The young man was overwhelmed, suspected deceit and cheating, and was almost beside himself.
<p/>And, indeed, this circumstance led to the catastrophe, the account of which forms the subject of my first introductory story, or rather the external side of it.
<p/>But before I pass to that story I must say a little of Fyodor Pavlovitch's other two sons, and of their origin.
<p/>Chapter III. The Second Marriage And The Second Family Very shortly after getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) four-year-old Mitya off his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) hands Fyodor Pavlovitch married a second time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) took this second wife, Sofya Ivanovna, also a very young girl, from another province, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had gone upon some small piece of business in company with a Jew.
<p/>Though Fyodor Pavlovitch was a drunkard and a vicious debauchee he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) never neglected investing his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) capital, and managed his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) business affairs very successfully, though, no doubt, not over- scrupulously.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) second marriage lasted eight years. Sofya Ivanovna was the daughter of an obscure deacon, and was left from childhood an orphan without relations.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) grew up in the house of a general's widow, a wealthy old lady of good position, who was at once her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) benefactress and tormentor.
<p/>I do not know the details, but I have only heard that the orphan girl, a meek and gentle creature, was once cut down from a halter in which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was hanging from a nail in the loft, so terrible were her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sufferings from the caprice and everlasting nagging of this old woman, who was apparently not bad-hearted but had become an insufferable tyrant through idleness.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) an offer; inquiries were made about him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was refused. But again, as in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) first marriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) proposed an elopement to the orphan girl.
<p/>There is very little doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would not on any account have married him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had known a little more about him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) in time.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lived in another province; besides, what could a little girl of sixteen know about it, except that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would be better at the bottom of the river than remaining with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) benefactress.
<p/>So the poor child exchanged a benefactress for a benefactor. Fyodor Pavlovitch did not get a penny this time, for the general's widow was furious.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had not reckoned on a dowry; what allured him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was the remarkable beauty of the innocent girl, above all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) innocent appearance, which had a peculiar attraction for a vicious profligate, who had hitherto admired only the coarser types of feminine beauty.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gave them nothing and cursed them both. '' Those innocent eyes slit my soul up like a razor,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) used to say afterwards, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) loathsome snigger.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had received no dowry with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) wife, and had, so to speak, taken her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``from the halter,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) did not stand on ceremony with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>Making her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``wronged''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) took advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) phenomenal meekness and submissiveness to trample on the elementary decencies of marriage.
<p/>In a man so depraved this might, of course, mean no more than sensual attraction. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gathered loose women into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house, and carried on orgies of debauchery in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife's presence.
<p/>To show what a pass things had come to, I may mention that Grigory, the gloomy, stupid, obstinate, argumentative servant, who had always hated his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) first mistress, Adelaďda Ivanovna, took the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) new mistress.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) championed her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) cause, abusing Fyodor Pavlovitch in a manner little befitting a servant, and on one occasion broke up the revels and drove all the disorderly women out of the house.
<p/>In the end this unhappy young woman, kept in terror from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) childhood, fell into that kind of nervous disease which is most frequently found in peasant women who are said to be <div class="bookquote">``possessed by devils.
<p/>Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bore Fyodor Pavlovitch two sons, Ivan and Alexey, the eldest in the first year of marriage and the second three years later.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) died, little Alexey was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) fourth year, and, strange as it seems, I know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) mother all his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) life, like a dream, of course.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>peasant women</b></font>)</div>At times after terrible fits of hysterics she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) even lost her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) reason. At her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death almost exactly the same thing happened to the two little boys as to their elder brother, Mitya.
<p/>They were looked after by the same Grigory and lived in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cottage, where they were found by the tyrannical old lady who had brought up their mother.
<p/>They were completely forgotten and abandoned by their father. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was still alive, and had not, all those eight years, forgotten the insult done her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>All that time she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was obtaining exact information as to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) Sofya's manner of life, and hearing of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) illness and hideous surroundings she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) declared aloud two or three times to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) retainers: <div class="bookquote">``It serves her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) right.
<p/>Exactly three months after Sofya Ivanovna's death the general's widow suddenly appeared in our town, and went straight to Fyodor Pavlovitch's house.
<p/>God has punished her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) ingratitude. ''  (<font color='red'><b>retainers</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) spent only half an hour in the town but she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) did a great deal.
<p/>The story is that instantly upon seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), without any sort of explanation, she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) two good, resounding slaps on the face, seized him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) by a tuft of hair, and shook him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) three times up and down.
<p/>It was evening. Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had not seen for those eight years, came in to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) drunk. Then, without a word, she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) went straight to the cottage to the two boys.
<p/>Seeing, at the first glance, that they were unwashed and in dirty linen, she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) promptly gave Grigory, too, a box on the ear, and announcing that she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) would carry off both the children she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) wrapped them just as they were in a rug, put them in the carriage, and drove off to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) own town.
<p/>Grigory accepted the blow like a devoted slave, without a word, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) escorted the old lady to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) carriage he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a low bow and pronounced impressively that, <div class="bookquote">``God would repay her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) for the orphans.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch, thinking it over, decided that it was a good thing, and did not refuse the general's widow his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) formal consent to any proposition in regard to his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) children's education.
<p/>'' You are a blockhead all the same,'' the old lady shouted to him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) drove away. As for the slaps she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) drove all over the town telling the story.
<p/>It happened that the old lady died soon after this, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) left the boys in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will a thousand roubles each <div class="bookquote">``for their instruction, and so that all be spent on them exclusively, with the condition that it be so portioned out as to last till they are twenty-one, for it is more than adequate provision for such children.
<p/>If other people think fit to throw away their money, let them. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>I have not read the will myself, but I heard there was something queer of the sort, very whimsically expressed.
<p/>The principal heir, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, the Marshal of Nobility of the province, turned out, however, to be an honest man.
<p/>Writing to Fyodor Pavlovitch, and discerning at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) could extract nothing from him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) children's education -LRB-though the latter never directly refused but only procrastinated as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) always did in such cases, and was, indeed, at times effusively sentimental-RRB-, Yefim Petrovitch took a personal interest in the orphans.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) became especially fond of the younger, Alexey, who lived for a long while as one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) family. I beg the reader to note this from the beginning.
<p/>And to Yefim Petrovitch, a man of a generosity and humanity rarely to be met with, the young people were more indebted for their education and bringing up than to any one.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept the two thousand roubles left to them by the general's widow intact, so that by the time they came of age their portions had been doubled by the accumulation of interest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) educated them both at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own expense, and certainly spent far more than a thousand roubles upon each of them.
<p/>I won't enter into a detailed account of their boyhood and youth, but will only mention a few of the most important events.
<p/>Of the elder, Ivan, I will only say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) grew into a somewhat morose and reserved, though far from timid boy.
<p/>At ten years old he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had realized that they were living not in their own home but on other people's charity, and that their father was a man of whom it was disgraceful to speak.
<p/>This boy began very early, almost in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) infancy -LRB-so they say at least-RRB-, to show a brilliant and unusual aptitude for learning.
<p/>I don't know precisely why, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) left the family of Yefim Petrovitch when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was hardly thirteen, entering a Moscow gymnasium, and boarding with an experienced and celebrated teacher, an old friend of Yefim Petrovitch.
<p/>Ivan used to declare afterwards that this was all due to the <div class="bookquote">``ardor for good works''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>of Yefim Petrovitch, who was captivated by the idea that the boy's genius should be trained by a teacher of genius.
<p/>But neither Yefim Petrovitch nor this teacher was living when the young man finished at the gymnasium and entered the university.
<p/>As Yefim Petrovitch had made no provision for the payment of the tyrannical old lady's legacy, which had grown from one thousand to two, it was delayed, owing to formalities inevitable in Russia, and the young man was in great straits for the first two years at the university, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was forced to keep himself all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was studying.
<p/>It must be noted that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not even attempt to communicate with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, perhaps from pride, from contempt for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or perhaps from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cool common sense, which told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that from such a father he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would get no real assistance.
<p/>However that may have been, the young man was by no means despondent and succeeded in getting work, at first giving sixpenny lessons and afterwards getting paragraphs on street incidents into the newspapers under the signature of <div class="bookquote">``Eye-Witness.
<p/>This alone showed the young man's practical and intellectual superiority over the masses of needy and unfortunate students of both sexes who hang about the offices of the newspapers and journals, unable to think of anything better than everlasting entreaties for copying and translations from the French.
<p/>Having once got into touch with the editors Ivan Fyodorovitch always kept up his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) connection with them, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) latter years at the university he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) published brilliant reviews of books upon various special subjects, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) became well known in literary circles.
<p/>But only in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) last year he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) suddenly succeeded in attracting the attention of a far wider circle of readers, so that a great many people noticed and remembered him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>These paragraphs, it was said, were so interesting and piquant that they were soon taken. It was rather a curious incident.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had just left the university and was preparing to go abroad upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) two thousand roubles, Ivan Fyodorovitch published in one of the more important journals a strange article, which attracted general notice, on a subject of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) might have been supposed to know nothing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was a student of natural science.
<p/>The article dealt with a subject which was being debated everywhere at the time--the position of the ecclesiastical courts. After discussing several opinions on the subject he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) went on to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) own view.
<p/>What was most striking about the article was its tone, and its unexpected conclusion. Many of the Church party regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) unquestioningly as on their side.
<p/>And yet not only the secularists but even atheists joined them in their applause. Finally some sagacious persons opined that the article was nothing but an impudent satirical burlesque.
<p/>I mention this incident particularly because this article penetrated into the famous monastery in our neighborhood, where the inmates, being particularly interested in the question of the ecclesiastical courts, were completely bewildered by it.
<p/>Learning the author's name, they were interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) being a native of the town and the son of <div class="bookquote">``that Fyodor Pavlovitch.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>And just then it was that the author himself made his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) appearance among us. Why Ivan Fyodorovitch had come amongst us
<p/>I remember asking myself at the time with a certain uneasiness. This fateful visit, which was the first step leading to so many consequences, I never fully explained to myself.
<p/>It seemed strange on the face of it that a young man so learned, so proud, and apparently so cautious, should suddenly visit such an infamous house and a father who had ignored him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life, hardly knew him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), never thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and would not under any circumstances have given him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) money, though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was always afraid that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sons Ivan and Alexey would also come to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) for it.
<p/>And here the young man was staying in the house of such a father, had been living with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for two months, and they were on the best possible terms.
<p/>Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, of whom we have spoken already, the cousin of Fyodor Pavlovitch's first wife, happened to be in the neighborhood again on a visit to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) estate.
<p/>This last fact was a special cause of wonder to many others as well as to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had come from Paris, which was his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) permanent home.
<p/>I remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was more surprised than any one when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) made the acquaintance of the young man, who interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) extremely, and with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) sometimes argued and not without an inner pang compared himself in acquirements.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) is proud,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) used to say, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) will never be in want of pence; he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) has got money enough to go abroad now.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) want here? Every one can see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) hasn't come for money, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) father would never give him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) any.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) has no taste for drink and dissipation, and yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) father can't do without him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>). They get on so well together!
<p/>That was the truth; the young man had an unmistakable influence over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, who positively appeared to be behaving more decently and even seemed at times ready to obey his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son, though often extremely and even spitefully perverse.
<p/>It was only later that we learned that Ivan had come partly at the request of, and in the interests of, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) elder brother, Dmitri, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) saw for the first time on this very visit, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had before leaving Moscow been in correspondence with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) about an important matter of more concern to Dmitri than himself.
<p/>'' What that business was the reader will learn fully in due time. Yet even when I did know of this special circumstance
<p/>I may add that Ivan appeared at the time in the light of a mediator between his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) elder brother Dmitri, who was in open quarrel with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father and even planning to bring an action against him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>The family, I repeat, was now united for the first time, and some of its members met for the first time in their lives.
<p/>I still felt Ivan Fyodorovitch to be an enigmatic figure, and thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) visit rather mysterious. The younger brother, Alexey, had been a year already among us, having been the first of the three to arrive.
<p/>Yet I must give some preliminary account of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>), if only to explain one queer fact, which is that I have to introduce my hero to the reader wearing the cassock of a novice.
<p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) had been for the last year in our monastery, and seemed willing to be cloistered there for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) life.
<p/>It is of that brother Alexey I find it most difficult to speak in this introduction. Chapter IV. The Third Son,
<p/>Alyosha He (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) was only twenty, his (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) brother Ivan was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) twenty-fourth year at the time, while their elder brother Dmitri was twenty-seven.
<p/>First of all, I must explain that this young man, Alyosha, was not a fanatic, and, in my opinion at least, was not even a mystic.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was simply an early lover of humanity, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) adopted the monastic life was simply because at that time it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), so to say, as the ideal escape for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul struggling from the darkness of worldly wickedness to the light of love.
<p/>And the reason this life struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in this way was that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found in it at that time, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought, an extraordinary being, our celebrated elder, Zossima, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became attached with all the warm first love of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ardent heart.
<p/>But I do not dispute that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very strange even at that time, and had been so indeed from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cradle.
<p/>I have mentioned already, by the way, that though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fourth year he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life--her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) caresses, <div class="bookquote">``as though she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stood living before me.
<p/>Such memories may persist, as every one knows, from an even earlier age, even from two years old, but scarcely standing out through a whole lifetime like spots of light out of darkness, like a corner torn out of a huge picture, which has all faded and disappeared except that fragment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered one still summer evening, an open window, the slanting rays of the setting sun -LRB-that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recalled most vividly of all-RRB-; in a corner of the room the holy image, before it a lighted lamp, and on her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees before the image his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother, sobbing hysterically with cries and moans, snatching him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up in both arms, squeezing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) close till it hurt, and praying for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the Mother of God, holding him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out in both arms to the image as though to put him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) under the Mother's protection ... and suddenly a nurse runs in and snatches him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) in terror.
<p/>I may as well give my full opinion from the beginning. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That is how it was with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). That was the picture!
<p/>And Alyosha remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's face at that minute. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used to say that it was frenzied but beautiful as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) childhood and youth he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was by no means expansive, and talked little indeed, but not from shyness or a sullen unsociability; quite the contrary, from something different, from a sort of inner preoccupation entirely personal and unconcerned with other people, but so important to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed, as it were, to forget others on account of it.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was fond of people: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed throughout his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life to put implicit trust in people: yet no one ever looked on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a simpleton or naďve person.
<p/>There was something about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) which made one feel at once -LRB-and it was so all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life afterwards-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not care to be a judge of others--that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would never take it upon himself to criticize and would never condemn any one for anything.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed, indeed, to accept everything without the least condemnation though often grieving bitterly: and this was so much so that no one could surprise or frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) earliest youth.
<p/>Coming at twenty to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's house, which was a very sink of filthy debauchery, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), chaste and pure as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, simply withdrew in silence when to look on was unbearable, but without the slightest sign of contempt or condemnation.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, who had once been in a dependent position, and so was sensitive and ready to take offense, met him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at first with distrust and sullenness.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rarely cared to speak of this memory to any one. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not say much,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used to say, <div class="bookquote">``and thinks the more.
<p/>But soon, within a fortnight indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took to embracing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) terribly often, with drunken tears, with sottish sentimentality, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) evidently felt a real and deep affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), such as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never been capable of feeling for any one before.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entered the household of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) patron and benefactor, Yefim Petrovitch Polenov, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gained the hearts of all the family, so that they looked on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quite as their own child.
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entered the house at such a tender age that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not have acted from design nor artfulness in winning affection.
<p/>So that the gift of making himself loved directly and unconsciously was inherent in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very nature, so to speak.
<p/>It was the same at school, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to be just one of those children who are distrusted, sometimes ridiculed, and even disliked by their schoolfellows.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Every one, indeed, loved this young man wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went, and it was so from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) earliest childhood. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was dreamy, for instance, and rather solitary.
<p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) earliest childhood he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was fond of creeping into a corner to read, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a general favorite all the while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was at school.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was rarely playful or merry, but any one could see at the first glance that this was not from any sullenness.
<p/>Perhaps because of this, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was never afraid of any one, yet the boys immediately understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fearlessness and seemed to be unaware that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was bold and courageous.
<p/>On the contrary he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was bright and good-tempered. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never tried to show off among his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) schoolfellows. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never resented an insult.
<p/>It would happen that an hour after the offense he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would address the offender or answer some question with as trustful and candid an expression as though nothing had happened between them.
<p/>And it was not that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to have forgotten or intentionally forgiven the affront, but simply that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not regard it as an affront, and this completely conquered and captivated the boys.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had one characteristic which made all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) schoolfellows from the bottom class to the top want to mock at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), not from malice
<p/>but because it amused them. This characteristic was a wild fanatical modesty and chastity. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not bear to hear certain words and certain conversations about women.
<p/>Boys pure in mind and heart, almost children, are fond of talking in school among themselves, and even aloud, of things, pictures, and images of which even soldiers would sometimes hesitate to speak.
<p/>More than that, much that soldiers have no knowledge or conception of is familiar to quite young children of our intellectual and higher classes.
<p/>There is no moral depravity, no real corrupt inner cynicism in it, but there is the appearance of it, and it is often looked upon among them as something refined, subtle, daring, and worthy of imitation.
<p/>Seeing that Alyosha Karamazov put his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) fingers in his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) ears when they talked of <div class="bookquote">``that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>they used sometimes to crowd round him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), pull his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) hands away, and shout nastiness into both ears, while he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) struggled, slipped to the floor, tried to hide himself without uttering one word of abuse, enduring their insults in silence.
<p/>But at last they left him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) alone and gave up taunting him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) with being a <div class="bookquote">``regular girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and what's more they looked upon it with compassion as a weakness.
<p/>There are <div class="bookquote">``certain''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>words and conversations unhappily impossible to eradicate in schools. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was always one of the best in the class but was never first.
<p/>The inconsolable widow went almost immediately after his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) death for a long visit to Italy with her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) whole family, which consisted only of women and girls.
<p/>Alyosha went to live in the house of two distant relations of Yefim Petrovitch, ladies whom he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had never seen before.
<p/>At the time of Yefim Petrovitch's death Alyosha had two more years to complete at the provincial gymnasium. On what terms he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) lived with them he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) did not know himself.
<p/>In that respect he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was a striking contrast to his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) elder brother Ivan, who struggled with poverty for his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) first two years in the university, maintained himself by his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) own efforts, and had from childhood been bitterly conscious of living at the expense of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) benefactor.
<p/>But this strange trait in Alyosha's character must not, I think, be criticized too severely, for at the slightest acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) any one would have perceived that Alyosha was one of those youths, almost of the type of religious enthusiast, who, if they were suddenly to come into possession of a large fortune, would not hesitate to give it away for the asking, either for good works or perhaps to a clever rogue.
<p/>It was very characteristic of him (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>), indeed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) never cared at whose expense he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) was living. In general he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) seemed scarcely to know the value of money, not, of course, in a literal sense.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) was given pocket-money, which he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) never asked for, he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) was either terribly careless of it so that it was gone in a moment, or he (<font color='blue'><b>rogue</b></font>) kept it for weeks together, not knowing what to do with it.
<p/>In later years Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, a man very sensitive on the score of money and bourgeois honesty, pronounced the following judgment, after getting to know Alyosha:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here is perhaps the one man in the world whom you might leave alone without a penny, in the center of an unknown town of a million inhabitants, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not come to harm, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not die of cold and hunger, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be fed and sheltered at once; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were not, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would find a shelter for himself, and it would cost him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no effort or humiliation.
<p/>And to shelter him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be no burden, but, on the contrary, would probably be looked on as a pleasure. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/>A year before the end of the course he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suddenly announced to the ladies that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going to see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father about a plan which had occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>The journey was not an expensive one, and the ladies would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pawn his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watch, a parting present from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) benefactor's family.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not finish his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) studies at the gymnasium. They were sorry and unwilling to let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go. They provided him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liberally with money and even fitted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out with new clothes and linen.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arrival in the town he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made no answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's first inquiry why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come before completing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) studies, and seemed, so they say, unusually thoughtful.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned half the money they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intended to go third class. It soon became apparent that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was looking for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's tomb.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) practically acknowledged at the time that that was the only object of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) visit. But it can hardly have been the whole reason of it.
<p/>It is more probable that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself did not understand and could not explain what had suddenly arisen in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul, and drawn him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) irresistibly into a new, unknown, but inevitable path.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch could not show him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) where his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) second wife was buried, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had never visited her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) grave since he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had thrown earth upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) coffin, and in the course of years had entirely forgotten where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was buried.
<p/>Three or four years after his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) wife's death he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had gone to the south of Russia and finally turned up in Odessa, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) spent several years.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) made the acquaintance at first, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) own words, <div class="bookquote">``of a lot of low Jews, Jewesses, and Jewkins,''  (<font color='red'><b>the acquaintance</b></font>)</div>and ended by being received by <div class="bookquote">``Jews high and low alike.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch, by the way, had for some time previously not been living in our town. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the acquaintance</b></font>)</div>It may be presumed that at this period he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) developed a peculiar faculty for making and hoarding money.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) finally returned to our town only three years before Alyosha's arrival. His (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) former acquaintances found him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) looking terribly aged, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was by no means an old man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) behaved not exactly with more dignity but with more effrontery. The former buffoon showed an insolent propensity for making buffoons of others.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) depravity with women was not simply what it used to be, but even more revolting. In a short time he (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) opened a great number of new taverns in the district.
<p/>Many of the inhabitants of the town and district were soon in his (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) debt, and, of course, had given good security.
<p/>Of late, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) looked somehow bloated and seemed more irresponsible, more uneven, had sunk into a sort of incoherence, used to begin one thing and go on with another, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) were letting himself go altogether.
<p/>It was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) had perhaps a hundred thousand roubles or not much less. He (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) was more and more frequently drunk.
<p/>And, if it had not been for the same servant Grigory, who by that time had aged considerably too, and used to look after him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) sometimes almost like a tutor, Fyodor Pavlovitch might have got into terrible scrapes.
<p/>Alyosha's arrival seemed to affect even his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) moral side, as though something had awakened in this prematurely old man which had long been dead in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul.
<p/>Do you know,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used often to say, looking at Alyosha, <div class="bookquote">``that you are like her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), `the crazy woman' '' (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>--that was what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used to call his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dead wife, Alyosha's mother.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to our town cemetery and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in a remote corner a cast-iron tombstone, cheap but decently kept, on which were inscribed the name and age of the deceased and the date of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death, and below a four-lined verse, such as are commonly used on old-fashioned middle-class tombs.
<p/>'' Grigory it was who pointed out the <div class="bookquote">``crazy woman's''  (<font color='red'><b>Grigory/Grigory Vassilyevitch</b></font>)</div>grave to Alyosha. To Alyosha's amazement this tomb turned out to be Grigory's doing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had put it up on the poor <div class="bookquote">``crazy woman's''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>grave at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own expense, after Fyodor Pavlovitch, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had often pestered about the grave, had gone to Odessa, abandoning the grave and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) memories.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) only listened to Grigory's minute and solemn account of the erection of the tomb; he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) stood with bowed head and walked away without uttering a word.
<p/>Alyosha showed no particular emotion at the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) mother's grave. It was perhaps a year before he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) visited the cemetery again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) suddenly took a thousand roubles to our monastery to pay for requiems for the soul of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) wife; but not for the second, Alyosha's mother, the <div class="bookquote">``crazy woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha mother woman</b></font>)</div>but for the first, Adelaďda Ivanovna, who used to thrash him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>).
<p/>But this little episode was not without an influence upon Fyodor Pavlovitch--and a very original one. In the evening of the same day he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) got drunk and abused the monks to Alyosha.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) himself was far from being religious; he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had probably never put a penny candle before the image of a saint.
<p/>Strange impulses of sudden feeling and sudden thought are common in such types. I have mentioned already that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) looked bloated.
<p/>Besides the long fleshy bags under his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) little, always insolent, suspicious, and ironical eyes; besides the multitude of deep wrinkles in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) little fat face, the Adam's apple hung below his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) sharp chin like a great, fleshy goiter, which gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) a peculiar, repulsive, sensual appearance; add to that a long rapacious mouth with full lips, between which could be seen little stumps of black decayed teeth.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) countenance at this time bore traces of something that testified unmistakably to the life he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had led. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) slobbered every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) began to speak.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was fond indeed of making fun of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) own face, though, I believe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was well satisfied with it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) used particularly to point to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) nose, which was not very large, but very delicate and conspicuously aquiline.
<p/>'' A regular Roman nose,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) used to say, <div class="bookquote">``with my goiter I've quite the countenance of an ancient Roman patrician of the decadent period.
<p/>Not long after visiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) mother's grave Alyosha suddenly announced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) wanted to enter the monastery, and that the monks were willing to receive him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) as a novice.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) seemed proud of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) explained that this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) strong desire, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was solemnly asking his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) consent as his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) father.
<p/>The old man knew that the elder Zossima, who was living in the monastery hermitage, had made a special impression upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``gentle boy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Zossima/Father Zossima/Father</b></font>)</div><p/>That is the most honest monk among them, of course,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) observed, after listening in thoughtful silence to Alyosha, and seeming scarcely surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) request.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) was half drunk, and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) grinned his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) slow half-drunken grin, which was not without a certain cunning and tipsy slyness.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``H'm!... So that's where you want to be, my gentle boy? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``H'm! ... I had a presentiment that you would end in something like this.
<p/>Would you believe it? You were making straight for it. Well, to be sure you have your own two thousand. That's a dowry for you.
<p/>And I'll never desert you, my angel. And I'll pay what's wanted for you there, if they ask for it. But, of course, if they don't ask, why should we worry them?
<p/>Do you know that near one monastery there's a place outside the town where every baby knows there are none but `the monks' wives' living, as they are called.
<p/>What do you say? You know, you spend money like a canary , two grains a week. H'm! ... Thirty women, I believe.
<p/>I have been there myself. You know, it's interesting in its own way, of course, as a variety. The worst of it is it's awfully Russian.
<p/>There are no French women there. Of course they could get them fast enough, they have plenty of money. If they get to hear of it they'll come along.
<p/>Well, there's nothing of that sort here, no `monks' wives,' and two hundred monks. They're honest. They keep the fasts. I admit it....
<p/>H'm.... So you want to be a monk? And do you know I'm sorry to lose you, Alyosha; would you believe it
<p/>, I've really grown fond of you? Well, it's a good opportunity. You'll pray for us sinners; we have sinned too much here.
<p/>I've always been thinking who would pray for me, and whether there's any one in the world to do it. My dear boy, I'm awfully stupid about that.
<p/>You see, however stupid I am about it, I keep thinking, I keep thinking--from time to time, of course, not all the while.
<p/>It's impossible, I think, for the devils to forget to drag me down to hell with their hooks when I die.
<p/>You wouldn't believe it. Awfully. Then I wonder--hooks? Where would they get them? What of? Iron hooks? Where do they forge them?
<p/>Have they a foundry there of some sort? The monks in the monastery probably believe that there's a ceiling in hell, for instance.
<p/>Now I'm ready to believe in hell, but without a ceiling. It makes it more refined, more enlightened, more Lutheran that is.
<p/>And, after all, what does it matter whether it has a ceiling or hasn't? But, do you know, there's a damnable question involved in it?
<p/>If there's no ceiling there can be no hooks, and if there are no hooks it all breaks down, which is unlikely again, for then there would be none to drag me down to hell, and if they don't drag me down what justice is there in the world?
<p/>Il faudrait les inventer , those hooks, on purpose for me alone, for, if you only knew, Alyosha, what a blackguard I am.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But there are no hooks there,'' said Alyosha, looking gently and seriously at his (<font color='blue'><b>blackguard</b></font>) father. '' Yes, yes, only the shadows of hooks, I know, I know.
<p/>That's how a Frenchman described hell: ' J'ai bu l'ombre d'un cocher qui avec l'ombre d'une brosse frottait l'ombre d'une carrosse. '
<p/>How do you know there are no hooks, darling? When you've lived with the monks you'll sing a different tune. But go and get at the truth there, and then come and tell me.
<p/>Besides, it will be more seemly for you with the monks than here with me, with a drunken old man and young harlots ... though you're like an angel, nothing touches you.
<p/>Anyway it's easier going to the other world if one knows what there is there. And I dare say nothing will touch you there.
<p/>That's why I let you go, because I hope for that. You've got all your wits about you. You will burn and you will burn out; you will be healed and come back again.
<p/>And I will wait for you. I feel that you're the only creature in the world who has not condemned me.
<p/>My dear boy, I feel it, you know. I can't help feeling it. '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) even began blubbering. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was sentimental.
<p/>Some of my readers may imagine that my young man was a sickly, ecstatic, poorly developed creature, a pale, consumptive dreamer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>dreamer</b></font>) was wicked and sentimental. Chapter V. Elders On the contrary, Alyosha was at this time a well-grown, red-cheeked, clear-eyed lad of nineteen, radiant with health.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was very handsome, too, graceful, moderately tall, with hair of a dark brown, with a regular, rather long, oval-shaped face, and wide-set dark gray, shining eyes; he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was very thoughtful, and apparently very serene.
<p/>I shall be told, perhaps, that red cheeks are not incompatible with fanaticism and mysticism; but I fancy that Alyosha was more of a realist than any one.
<p/>no doubt, in the monastery he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) fully believed in miracles, but, to my thinking, miracles are never a stumbling-block to the realist.
<p/>The genuine realist, if he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) is an unbeliever, will always find strength and ability to disbelieve in the miraculous, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) is confronted with a miracle as an irrefutable fact he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) would rather disbelieve his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) own senses than admit the fact.
<p/>Oh! It is not miracles that dispose realists to belief. Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) admits it, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) admits it as a fact of nature till then unrecognized by him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>).
<p/>Faith does not, in the realist, spring from the miracle but the miracle from faith. If the realist once believes, then he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) is bound by his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) very realism to admit the miraculous also.
<p/>The Apostle Thomas said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would not believe till he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) saw, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) did see he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) said, ``My Lord and my God!
<p/>Most likely not, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) believed solely because he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) desired to believe and possibly he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fully believed in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) secret heart even when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I do not believe till I see.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Was it the miracle forced him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to believe? '' I shall be told, perhaps, that Alyosha was stupid, undeveloped, had not finished his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) studies, and so on.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not finish his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) studies is true, but to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was stupid or dull would be a great injustice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) entered upon this path only because, at that time, it alone struck his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) imagination and presented itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) as offering an ideal means of escape for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul from darkness to light.
<p/>Add to that that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was to some extent a youth of our last epoch--that is, honest in nature, desiring the truth, seeking for it and believing in it, and seeking to serve it at once with all the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul, seeking for immediate action, and ready to sacrifice everything, life itself, for it.
<p/>Though these young men unhappily fail to understand that the sacrifice of life is, in many cases, the easiest of all sacrifices, and that to sacrifice, for instance, five or six years of their seething youth to hard and tedious study, if only to multiply tenfold their powers of serving the truth and the cause they have set before them as their goal--such a sacrifice is utterly beyond the strength of many of them.
<p/>The path Alyosha chose was a path going in the opposite direction, but he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) chose it with the same thirst for swift achievement.
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) reflected seriously he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was convinced of the existence of God and immortality, and at once he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) instinctively said to himself: <div class="bookquote">``I want to live for immortality, and I will accept no compromise.
<p/>In the same way, if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had decided that God and immortality did not exist, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would at once have become an atheist and a socialist.
<p/>For socialism is not merely the labor question, it is before all things the atheistic question, the question of the form taken by atheism to-day, the question of the tower of Babel built without God, not to mount to heaven from earth but to set up heaven on earth.
<p/>I'll simply repeat what I have said above. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Alyosha would have found it strange and impossible to go on living as before.
<p/>Alyosha said to himself: ``I can't give two roubles instead of `all,' and only go to mass instead of `following Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).'
<p/>It is written: <div class="bookquote">``Give all that thou hast to the poor and follow Me, if thou wouldst be perfect. ''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>'' Perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) memories of childhood brought back our monastery, to which his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother may have taken him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to mass.
<p/>Perhaps the slanting sunlight and the holy image to which his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) poor <div class="bookquote">``crazy''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>mother had held him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) up still acted upon his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) imagination.
<p/>Brooding on these things he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) may have come to us perhaps only to see whether here he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could sacrifice all or only <div class="bookquote">``two roubles,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and in the monastery he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) met this elder.
<p/>I must digress to explain what an <div class="bookquote">``elder''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>is in Russian monasteries, and I am sorry that I do not feel very competent to do so.
<p/>Authorities on the subject assert that the institution of <div class="bookquote">``elders''  (<font color='red'><b>Authorities</b></font>)</div>is of recent date, not more than a hundred years old in our monasteries, though in the orthodox East, especially in Sinai and Athos, it has existed over a thousand years.
<p/>It is maintained that it existed in ancient times in Russia also, but through the calamities which overtook Russia--the Tartars, civil war, the interruption of relations with the East after the destruction of Constantinople--this institution fell into oblivion.
<p/>It was revived among us towards the end of last century by one of the great <div class="bookquote">``ascetics,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>as they called him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), Paďssy Velitchkovsky, and his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) disciples.
<p/>But to this day it exists in few monasteries only, and has sometimes been almost persecuted as an innovation in Russia.
<p/>I will try, however, to give a superficial account of it in a few words. It flourished especially in the celebrated Kozelski Optin Monastery.
<p/>When and how it was introduced into our monastery I cannot say. There had already been three such elders and Zossima was the last of them.
<p/>The question for our monastery was an important one, for it had not been distinguished by anything in particular till then: they had neither relics of saints, nor wonder-working ikons, nor glorious traditions, nor historical exploits.
<p/>It had flourished and been glorious all over Russia through its elders, to see and hear whom pilgrims had flocked for thousands of miles from all parts.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) was almost dying of weakness and disease, and they had no one to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) place. What was such an elder?
<p/>When you choose an elder, you renounce your own will and yield it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) in complete submission, complete self- abnegation.
<p/>This novitiate, this terrible school of abnegation, is undertaken voluntarily, in the hope of self-conquest, of self-mastery, in order, after a life of obedience, to attain perfect freedom, that is, from self; to escape the lot of those who have lived their whole life without finding their true selves in themselves.
<p/>This institution of elders is not founded on theory, but was established in the East from the practice of a thousand years.
<p/>An elder was one who took your soul, your will, into his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) soul and his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) will. The obligations due to an elder are not the ordinary <div class="bookquote">``obedience''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>which has always existed in our Russian monasteries.
<p/>The obligation involves confession to the elder by all who have submitted themselves to him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), and to the indissoluble bond between him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) and them.
<p/>The story is told, for instance, that in the early days of Christianity one such novice, failing to fulfill some command laid upon him (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) elder, left his (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) monastery in Syria and went to Egypt.
<p/>When the Church, regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) as a saint, was burying him (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>), suddenly, at the deacon's exhortation, <div class="bookquote">``Depart all ye unbaptized,''  (<font color='red'><b>the deacon</b></font>)</div>the coffin containing the martyr's body left its place and was cast forth from the church, and this took place three times.
<p/>And only at last they learnt that this holy man had broken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vow of obedience and left his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elder, and, therefore, could not be forgiven without the elder's absolution in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) great deeds.
<p/>There, after great exploits, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was found worthy at last to suffer torture and a martyr's death for the faith. Only after this could the funeral take place.
<p/>A monk was suddenly commanded by his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) elder to quit Athos, which he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) loved as a sacred place and a haven of refuge, and to go first to Jerusalem to do homage to the Holy Places and then to go to the north to Siberia:
<p/>This, of course, is only an old legend. But here is a recent instance. <div class="bookquote">``There is the place for thee and not here.
<p/>The monk, overwhelmed with sorrow, went to the OEcumenical Patriarch at Constantinople and besought him (<font color='blue'><b>Patriarch</b></font>) to release him (<font color='blue'><b>Patriarch</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Patriarch</b></font>) obedience.
<p/>But the Patriarch replied that not only was he (<font color='blue'><b>Patriarch</b></font>) unable to release him (<font color='blue'><b>Patriarch</b></font>), but there was not and could not be on earth a power which could release him (<font color='blue'><b>Patriarch</b></font>) except the elder who had himself laid that duty upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Patriarch</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the elders</b></font>)</div>In this way the elders are endowed in certain cases with unbounded and inexplicable authority. That is why in many of our monasteries
<p/>the institution was at first resisted almost to persecution. Meantime the elders immediately began to be highly esteemed among the people.
<p/>Masses of the ignorant people as well as men of distinction flocked, for instance, to the elders of our monastery to confess their doubts, their sins, and their sufferings, and ask for counsel and admonition.
<p/>Seeing this, the opponents of the elders declared that the sacrament of confession was being arbitrarily and frivolously degraded, though the continual opening of the heart to the elder by the monk or the layman had nothing of the character of the sacrament.
<p/>It is true, perhaps, that this instrument which had stood the test of a thousand years for the moral regeneration of a man from slavery to freedom and to moral perfectibility may be a two-edged weapon and it may lead some not to humility and complete self-control but to the most Satanic pride, that is, to bondage and not to freedom.
<p/>In the end, however, the institution of elders has been retained and is becoming established in Russian monasteries. The elder Zossima was sixty-five.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) came of a family of landowners, had been in the army in early youth, and served in the Caucasus as an officer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had, no doubt, impressed Alyosha by some peculiar quality of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) soul. Alyosha lived in the cell of the elder, who was very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) and let him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) wait upon him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>).
<p/>It must be noted that Alyosha was bound by no obligation and could go where he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) pleased and be absent for whole days.
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) wore the monastic dress it was voluntarily, not to be different from others. No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) liked to do so.
<p/>It was said that so many people had for years past come to confess their sins to Father Zossima and to entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) for words of advice and healing, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) had acquired the keenest intuition and could tell from an unknown face what a new-comer wanted, and what was the suffering on his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) conscience.
<p/>Possibly his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) youthful imagination was deeply stirred by the power and fame of his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) elder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) sometimes astounded and almost alarmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) visitors by his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) knowledge of their secrets before they had spoken a word.
<p/>Alyosha noticed that many, almost all, went in to the elder for the first time with apprehension and uneasiness, but came out with bright and happy faces.
<p/>Alyosha was particularly struck by the fact that Father Zossima was not at all stern. On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) was always almost gay.
<p/>The monks used to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) was more drawn to those who were more sinful, and the greater the sinner the more he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>).
<p/>There were, no doubt, up to the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) life, among the monks some who hated and envied him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>), but they were few in number and they were silent, though among them were some of great dignity in the monastery, one, for instance, of the older monks distinguished for his (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) strict keeping of fasts and vows of silence.
<p/>But the majority were on Father Zossima's side and very many of them loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) with all their hearts, warmly and sincerely.
<p/>Some were almost fanatically devoted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>), and declared, though not quite aloud, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) was a saint, that there could be no doubt of it, and, seeing that his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) end was near, they anticipated miracles and great glory to the monastery in the immediate future from his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) relics.
<p/>Alyosha had unquestioning faith in the miraculous power of the elder, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) had unquestioning faith in the story of the coffin that flew out of the church.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) saw many who came with sick children or relatives and besought the elder to lay hands on them and to pray over them, return shortly after--some the next day--and, falling in tears at the elder's feet, thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) for healing their sick.
<p/>Whether they had really been healed or were simply better in the natural course of the disease was a question which did not exist for Alyosha, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) fully believed in the spiritual power of his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) teacher and rejoiced in his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) fame, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) glory, as though it were his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) own triumph.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) heart throbbed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) beamed, as it were, all over when the elder came out to the gates of the hermitage into the waiting crowd of pilgrims of the humbler class who had flocked from all parts of Russia on purpose to see the elder and obtain his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) blessing.
<p/>They fell down before him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>), wept, kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) feet, kissed the earth on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) stood, and wailed, while the women held up their children to him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) the sick <div class="bookquote">``possessed with devils.
<p/>Of late he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) had become so weak through attacks of illness that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) was sometimes unable to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) cell, and the pilgrims waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) to come out for several days.
<p/>Alyosha did not wonder why they loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) so, why they fell down before him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) and wept with emotion merely at seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) face.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) understood that for the humble soul of the Russian peasant, worn out by grief and toil, and still more by the everlasting injustice and everlasting sin, his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) own and the world's, it was the greatest need and comfort to find some one or something holy to fall down before and worship.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The elder spoke to them, read a brief prayer over them, blessed them, and dismissed them. Oh! '' Among us there is sin, injustice, and temptation, but yet, somewhere on earth there is some one holy and exalted.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) has the truth; he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) knows the truth; so it is not dead upon the earth; so it will come one day to us, too, and rule over all the earth according to the promise.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) understood it, but that the elder Zossima was this saint and custodian of God's truth--of that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) had no more doubt than the weeping peasants and the sick women who held out their children to the elder.
<p/>The conviction that after his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) death the elder would bring extraordinary glory to the monastery was even stronger in Alyosha than in any one there, and, of late, a kind of deep flame of inner ecstasy burnt more and more strongly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) heart.
<p/>'' Alyosha knew that this was just how the people felt and even reasoned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) was not at all troubled at this elder's standing as a solitary example before him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) carries in his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) heart the secret of renewal for all: that power which will, at last, establish truth on the earth, and all men will be holy and love one another, and there will be no more rich nor poor, no exalted nor humbled, but all will be as the children of God, and the true Kingdom of Christ will come.
<p/>The arrival of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) two brothers, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had not known till then, seemed to make a great impression on Alyosha.
<p/>'' No matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) is holy. '' That was the dream in Alyosha's heart. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) more quickly made friends with his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) half-brother Dmitri -LRB-though he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) arrived later-RRB- than with his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) own brother Ivan.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was extremely interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) brother Ivan, but when the latter had been two months in the town, though they had met fairly often, they were still not intimate.
<p/>Alyosha was naturally silent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) seemed to be expecting something, ashamed about something, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) brother Ivan, though Alyosha noticed at first that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) looked long and curiously at him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>), seemed soon to have left off thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>).
<p/>Alyosha noticed it with some embarrassment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) ascribed his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) brother's indifference at first to the disparity of their age and education.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) also wondered whether the absence of curiosity and sympathy in Ivan might be due to some other cause entirely unknown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) kept fancying that Ivan was absorbed in something--something inward and important--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was striving towards some goal, perhaps very hard to attain, and that that was why he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had no thought for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>Alyosha wondered, too, whether there was not some contempt on the part of the learned atheist for him (<font color='blue'><b>atheist</b></font>)--a foolish novice. He (<font color='blue'><b>atheist</b></font>) knew for certain that his (<font color='blue'><b>atheist</b></font>) brother was an atheist.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>atheist</b></font>) could not take offense at this contempt, if it existed; yet, with an uneasy embarrassment which he (<font color='blue'><b>atheist</b></font>) did not himself understand, he (<font color='blue'><b>atheist</b></font>) waited for his (<font color='blue'><b>atheist</b></font>) brother to come nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>atheist</b></font>).
<p/>From him (<font color='blue'><b>atheist</b></font>) Alyosha learnt all the details of the important affair which had of late formed such a close and remarkable bond between the two elder brothers.
<p/>Dmitri's enthusiastic references to Ivan were the more striking in Alyosha's eyes since Dmitri was, compared with Ivan, almost uneducated, and the two brothers were such a contrast in personality and character that it would be difficult to find two men more unlike.
<p/>It was at this time that the meeting, or, rather gathering of the members of this inharmonious family took place in the cell of the elder who had such an extraordinary influence on Alyosha.
<p/>Dmitri used to speak of Ivan with the deepest respect and with a peculiar earnestness. The pretext for this gathering was a false one.
<p/>It was at this time that the discord between Dmitri and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) father seemed at its acutest stage and their relations had become insufferably strained.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch seems to have been the first to suggest, apparently in joke, that they should all meet in Father Zossima's cell, and that, without appealing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) direct intervention, they might more decently come to an understanding under the conciliating influence of the elder's presence.
<p/>Dmitri, who had never seen the elder, naturally supposed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) father was trying to intimidate him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) secretly blamed himself for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) outbursts of temper with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) father on several recent occasions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) accepted the challenge.
<p/>It must be noted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was not, like Ivan, staying with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father, but living apart at the other end of the town.
<p/>A Liberal of the forties and fifties, a freethinker and atheist, he (<font color='blue'><b>Liberal</b></font>) may have been led on by boredom or the hope of frivolous diversion.
<p/>It happened that Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, who was staying in the district at the time, caught eagerly at the idea. He (<font color='blue'><b>Liberal</b></font>) was suddenly seized with the desire to see the monastery and the holy man.
<p/>As his (<font color='blue'><b>Liberal</b></font>) lawsuit with the monastery still dragged on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Liberal</b></font>) made it the pretext for seeing the Superior, in order to attempt to settle it amicably.
<p/>A visitor coming with such laudable intentions might be received with more attention and consideration than if he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) came from simple curiosity.
<p/>Influences from within the monastery were brought to bear on the elder, who of late had scarcely left his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) cell, and had been forced by illness to deny even his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) ordinary visitors.
<p/>In the end he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) consented to see them, and the day was fixed. '' Who has made me a judge over them?
<p/>'' was all he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) said, smilingly, to Alyosha. Alyosha was much perturbed when he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) heard of the proposed visit. Of all the wrangling, quarrelsome party, Dmitri was the only one who could regard the interview seriously.
<p/>Ivan and Miüsov would come from curiosity, perhaps of the coarsest kind, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father might be contemplating some piece of buffoonery.
<p/>All the others would come from frivolous motives, perhaps insulting to the elder. Alyosha was well aware of that. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said nothing, Alyosha thoroughly understood his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father.
<p/>The boy, I repeat, was far from being so simple as every one thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) awaited the day with a heavy heart.
<p/>No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was always pondering in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) mind how the family discord could be ended. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) chief anxiety concerned the elder.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) trembled for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) glory, and dreaded any affront to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), especially the refined, courteous irony of Miüsov and the supercilious half-utterances of the highly educated Ivan.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) only sent word the day before, through a friend, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother Dmitri, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) and expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) promise.
<p/>Dmitri wondered, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) could not remember what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had promised, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) answered by letter that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) would do his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) utmost not to let himself be provoked <div class="bookquote">``by vileness,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but that, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had a deep respect for the elder and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) brother Ivan, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was convinced that the meeting was either a trap for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) or an unworthy farce.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) even wanted to venture on warning the elder, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) something about them, but, on second thoughts, said nothing. ''
<p/>Nevertheless I would rather bite out my tongue than be lacking in respect to the sainted man whom you reverence so highly,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote in conclusion.
<p/>Alyosha was not greatly cheered by the letter. Book II. An Unfortunate Gathering Chapter I. They Arrive At The Monastery It was a warm, bright day at the end of August.
<p/>The interview with the elder had been fixed for half-past eleven, immediately after late mass. Our visitors did not take part in the service, but arrived just as it was over.
<p/>First an elegant open carriage, drawn by two valuable horses, drove up with Miüsov and a distant relative of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), a young man of twenty, called Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov.
<p/>Miüsov, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was staying for the time, was trying to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to go abroad to the university of Zurich or Jena.
<p/>This young man was preparing to enter the university. The young man was still undecided. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was thoughtful and absent-minded. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was nice- looking, strongly built, and rather tall.
<p/>There was a strange fixity in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gaze at times. Like all very absent-minded people he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would sometimes stare at a person without seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was silent and rather awkward, but sometimes, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was alone with any one, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became talkative and effusive, and would laugh at anything or nothing.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) animation vanished as quickly as it appeared. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was always well and even elaborately dressed; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had already some independent fortune and expectations of much more.
<p/>In an ancient, jolting, but roomy, hired carriage, with a pair of old pinkish-gray horses, a long way behind Miüsov's carriage, came Fyodor Pavlovitch, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) son Ivan.
<p/>The visitors left their carriage at the hotel, outside the precincts, and went to the gates of the monastery on foot.
<p/>Except Fyodor Pavlovitch, none of the party had ever seen the monastery, and Miüsov had probably not even been to church for thirty years.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was a friend of Alyosha's. Dmitri was late, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had been informed of the time the evening before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) with curiosity, together with assumed ease.
<p/>But, except the church and the domestic buildings, though these too were ordinary enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) found nothing of interest in the interior of the monastery.
<p/>The last of the worshippers were coming out of the church, bareheaded and crossing themselves. Among the humbler people were a few of higher rank--two or three ladies and a very old general.
<p/>Our visitors were at once surrounded by beggars, but none of them gave them anything, except young Kalganov, who took a ten- copeck piece out of his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) purse, and, nervous and embarrassed--God knows why!--hurriedly gave it to an old woman, saying: ``Divide it equally.
<p/>None of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) companions made any remark upon it, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had no reason to be embarrassed; but, perceiving this, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was even more overcome.
<p/>It was strange that their arrival did not seem expected, and that they were not received with special honor, though one of them had recently made a donation of a thousand roubles, while another was a very wealthy and highly cultured landowner, upon whom all in the monastery were in a sense dependent, as a decision of the lawsuit might at any moment put their fishing rights in his (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Miüsov looked absent-mindedly at the tombstones round the church, and was on the point of saying that the dead buried here must have paid a pretty penny for the right of lying in this <div class="bookquote">``holy place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miüsov/Pyotr Alexandrovitch/Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov</b></font>)</div>but refrained.
<p/>They were all staying at the hotel. '' Yet no official personage met them. His (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) liberal irony was rapidly changing almost into anger.
<p/>'' Who the devil is there to ask in this imbecile place? We must find out, for time is passing,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) observed suddenly, as though speaking to himself.
<p/>All at once there came up a bald-headed, elderly man with ingratiating little eyes, wearing a full, summer overcoat. Lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) introduced himself with a honeyed lisp as Maximov, a landowner of Tula.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) at once entered into our visitors' difficulty. '' Father Zossima lives in the hermitage, apart, four hundred paces from the monastery, the other side of the copse.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it's the other side of the copse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div>observed Fyodor Pavlovitch, <div class="bookquote">``but we don't remember the way. It is a long time since we've been here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div><p/>'' This way, by this gate, and straight across the copse ... the copse. Come with me, won't you? I'll show you.
<p/>I have to go.... I am going myself. This way, this way. '' They came out of the gate and turned towards the copse.
<p/>Maximov, a man of sixty, ran rather than walked, turning sideways to stare at them all, with an incredible degree of nervous curiosity.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) eyes looked starting out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) head. '' You see, we have come to the elder upon business of our own,'' observed Miüsov severely.
<p/>That personage has granted us an audience, so to speak, and so, though we thank you for showing us the way, we cannot ask you to accompany us.''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I've been there. I've been already; un chevalier parfait ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maximov</b></font>)</div>and Maximov snapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) fingers in the air. '' Who is a chevalier ?'' asked Miüsov.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>chevalier</b></font>) incoherent talk was cut short by a very pale, wan-looking monk of medium height, wearing a monk's cap, who overtook them.
<p/>'' The elder, the splendid elder, the elder! The honor and glory of the monastery, Zossima. Such an elder!'' Fyodor Pavlovitch and Miüsov stopped.
<p/>The monk, with an extremely courteous, profound bow, announced: <div class="bookquote">``The Father Superior invites all of you gentlemen to dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) after your visit to the hermitage.
<p/>At one o'clock, not later. And you also,''  (<font color='red'><b>The monk</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) added, addressing Maximov. '' That I certainly will, without fail,'' cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, hugely delighted at the invitation.
<p/>'' And, believe me, we've all given our word to behave properly here.... And you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, will you go, too?''
<p/>'' Yes, of course. What have I come for but to study all the customs here? The only obstacle to me is your company...''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Dmitri Fyodorovitch is non-existent as yet. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It would be a capital thing if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) didn't turn up. Do you suppose I like all this business, and in your company, too?
<p/>So we will come to dinner. Thank the Father Superior,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said to the monk. '' No, it is my duty now to conduct you to the elder,'' answered the monk.
<p/>'' If so I'll go straight to the Father Superior--to the Father Superior,'' babbled Maximov. '' The Father Superior is engaged just now.
<p/>But as you please--'' the monk hesitated. '' Impertinent old man!'' Miüsov observed aloud, while Maximov ran back to the monastery.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>)'s like von Sohn,'' Fyodor Pavlovitch said suddenly. '' Is that all you can think of?... In what way is he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) like von Sohn?
<p/>Have you ever seen von Sohn?'' '' I've seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Sohn</b></font>) portrait. It's not the features, but something indefinable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sohn</b></font>)'s a second von Sohn.
<p/>I can always tell from the physiognomy.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, I dare say you are a connoisseur in that. But, look here, Fyodor Pavlovitch, you said just now that we had given our word to behave properly.
<p/>Remember it. I advise you to control yourself. But, if you begin to play the fool I don't intend to be associated with you here....
<p/>A fine smile, not without a certain slyness, came on to the pale, bloodless lips of the monk, but he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) made no reply, and was evidently silent from a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) own dignity.
<p/>You see what a man he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) is'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) turned to the monk--<div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid to go among decent people with him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>the monk</b></font>)</div>Miüsov frowned more than ever.
<p/>'' Oh, devil take them all! An outer show elaborated through centuries, and nothing but charlatanism and nonsense underneath,'' flashed through Miüsov's mind.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) repeatedly made the sign of the cross to the saints painted above and on the sides of the gates.
<p/>'' Here's the hermitage. We've arrived,'' cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. '' The gates are shut. '' '' When you go to Rome you must do as the Romans do.
<p/>Here in this hermitage there are twenty-five saints being saved. They look at one another, and eat cabbages. And not one woman goes in at this gate.
<p/>That's what is remarkable. And that really is so. But I did hear that the elder receives ladies,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) remarked suddenly to the monk.
<p/>But for ladies of higher rank two rooms have been built adjoining the portico, but outside the precincts--you can see the windows--and the elder goes out to them by an inner passage when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) is well enough.
<p/>'' Women of the people are here too now, lying in the portico there waiting. They are always outside the precincts.
<p/>Probably he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) has promised to come out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), though of late he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) has been so weak that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) has hardly shown himself even to the people.''
<p/>There is a Harkov lady, Madame Hohlakov, waiting there now with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sick daughter. '' So then there are loopholes, after all, to creep out of the hermitage to the ladies.
<p/>But do you know that at Athos not only the visits of women are not allowed, but no creature of the female sex--no hens, nor turkey-hens, nor cows.''
<p/>Don't suppose, holy father, that I mean any harm. <div class="bookquote">``Fyodor Pavlovitch, I warn you I shall go back and leave you here.
<p/>They'll turn you out when I'm gone.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' But I'm not interfering with you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Look,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) cried suddenly, stepping within the precincts, <div class="bookquote">``what a vale of roses they live in!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Though there were no roses now, there were numbers of rare and beautiful autumn flowers growing wherever there was space for them, and evidently tended by a skillful hand; there were flower-beds round the church, and between the tombs; and the one-storied wooden house where the elder lived was also surrounded with flowers.
<p/>They say he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) used to jump up and thrash even ladies with a stick,'' observed Fyodor Pavlovitch, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) went up the steps.
<p/>'' And was it like this in the time of the last elder, Varsonofy? He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) didn't care for such elegance. ''
<p/>The elder Varsonofy did sometimes seem rather strange, but a great deal that's told is foolishness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) never thrashed any one,'' answered the monk.
<p/>'' Now, gentlemen, if you will wait a minute I will announce you.'' <div class="bookquote">``Fyodor Pavlovitch, for the last time, your compact, do you hear?
<p/>Behave properly or I will pay you out! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miüsov/Pyotr Alexandrovitch/Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov</b></font>)</div>Miüsov had time to mutter again. '' I can't think why you are so agitated,'' Fyodor Pavlovitch observed sarcastically.
<p/>'' Are you uneasy about your sins? They say he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) can tell by one's eyes what one has come about. And what a lot you think of their opinion!
<p/>you, a Parisian, and so advanced. I'm surprised at you. '' But Miüsov had no time to reply to this sarcasm.
<p/>Now, I know myself, I am annoyed, I shall lose my temper and begin to quarrel--and lower myself and my ideas,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) reflected.
<p/>They were asked to come in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) walked in, somewhat irritated. '' Chapter II. The Old Buffoon They entered the room almost at the same moment that the elder came in from his (<font color='blue'><b>Buffoon</b></font>) bedroom.
<p/>There were already in the cell, awaiting the elder, two monks of the hermitage, one the Father Librarian, and the other Father Paďssy, a very learned man, so they said, in delicate health, though not old.
<p/>There was also a tall young man, who looked about two and twenty, standing in the corner throughout the interview. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a broad, fresh face, and clever, observant, narrow brown eyes, and was wearing ordinary dress.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a divinity student, living under the protection of the monastery. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expression was one of unquestioning, but self-respecting, reverence.
<p/>Being in a subordinate and dependent position, and so not on an equality with the guests, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not greet them with a bow.
<p/>The two monks rose and greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with a very deep bow, touching the ground with their fingers; then kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Father Zossima was accompanied by a novice, and by Alyosha. Blessing them, the elder replied with as deep a reverence to them, and asked their blessing.
<p/>The whole ceremony was performed very seriously and with an appearance of feeling, not like an everyday rite. But Miüsov fancied that it was all done with intentional impressiveness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) ought--he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) had reflected upon it the evening before--from simple politeness, since it was the custom here, to have gone up to receive the elder's blessing, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) did not kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) hand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) stood in front of the other visitors. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) saw all this bowing and kissing on the part of the monks he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) instantly changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) mind.
<p/>With dignified gravity he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) made a rather deep, conventional bow, and moved away to a chair. Fyodor Pavlovitch did the same, mimicking Miüsov like an ape.
<p/>Ivan bowed with great dignity and courtesy, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) too kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hands at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) sides, while Kalganov was so confused that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) did not bow at all.
<p/>The elder let fall the hand raised to bless them, and bowing to them again, asked them all to sit down.
<p/>Father Zossima sat down on a very old-fashioned mahogany sofa, covered with leather, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) visitors sit down in a row along the opposite wall on four mahogany chairs, covered with shabby black leather.
<p/>The blood rushed to Alyosha's cheeks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) was ashamed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) forebodings were coming true. The monks sat, one at the door and the other at the window.
<p/>The divinity student, the novice, and Alyosha remained standing. The cell was not very large and had a faded look. It contained nothing but the most necessary furniture, of coarse and poor quality.
<p/>There were two pots of flowers in the window, and a number of holy pictures in the corner. Before one huge ancient ikon of the Virgin a lamp was burning.
<p/>Near it were two other holy pictures in shining settings, and, next them, carved cherubims, china eggs, a Catholic cross of ivory, with a Mater Dolorosa embracing it, and several foreign engravings from the great Italian artists of past centuries.
<p/>Next to these costly and artistic engravings were several of the roughest Russian prints of saints and martyrs, such as are sold for a few farthings at all the fairs.
<p/>On the other walls were portraits of Russian bishops, past and present. Miüsov took a cursory glance at all these <div class="bookquote">``conventional''  (<font color='red'><b>Miüsov/Pyotr Alexandrovitch/Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov</b></font>)</div>surroundings and bent an intent look upon the elder.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Miüsov</b></font>) had a high opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Miüsov</b></font>) own insight, a weakness excusable in him (<font color='blue'><b>Miüsov</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Miüsov</b></font>) was fifty, an age at which a clever man of the world of established position can hardly help taking himself rather seriously.
<p/>At the first moment he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not like Zossima. There was, indeed, something in the elder's face which many people besides Miüsov might not have liked.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a short, bent, little man, with very weak legs, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was only sixty-five, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at least ten years older.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face was very thin and covered with a network of fine wrinkles, particularly numerous about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, which were small, light-colored, quick, and shining like two bright points.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a sprinkling of gray hair about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) temples. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pointed beard was small and scanty, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips, which smiled frequently, were as thin as two threads.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose was not long, but sharp, like a bird's beak. '' To all appearances a malicious soul, full of petty pride,'' thought Miüsov.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt altogether dissatisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position. A cheap little clock on the wall struck twelve hurriedly, and served to begin the conversation.
<p/>'' Precisely to our time,'' cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, <div class="bookquote">``but no sign of my son, Dmitri. I apologize for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), sacred elder!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-Alyosha shuddered all over at <div class="bookquote">``sacred elder.'' (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>-RRB- '' I am always punctual myself, minute for minute, remembering that punctuality is the courtesy of kings...''
<p/>'' But you are not a king, anyway,'' Miüsov muttered, losing his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) self- restraint at once. '' Yes; that's true. I'm not a king, and, would you believe it, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I was aware of that myself.
<p/>But, there! I always say the wrong thing. Your reverence,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) cried, with sudden pathos, <div class="bookquote">``you behold before you a buffoon in earnest!
<p/>And if I sometimes talk nonsense out of place it's with an object, with the object of amusing people and making myself agreeable.
<p/>I was seven years ago in a little town where I had business, and I made friends with some merchants there.
<p/>We went to the captain of police because we had to see him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) about something, and to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) to dine with us.
<p/>I introduce myself as such. It's an old habit, alas! One must be agreeable, mustn't one? He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was a tall, fat, fair, sulky man, the most dangerous type in such cases.
<p/>It's their liver. I went straight up to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and with the ease of a man of the world, you know, '
<p/>Mr. Ispravnik,' said I, `be our Napravnik.' ' What do you mean by Napravnik?' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>). I saw, at the first half-second, that it had missed fire.
<p/>I wanted to make a joke,' said I, `for the general diversion, as Mr. Napravnik is our well-known Russian orchestra conductor and what we need for the harmony of our undertaking is some one of that sort.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) stood there so glum. ' And I explained my comparison very reasonably, didn't I? ' Excuse me,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>), 'I am an Ispravnik, and I do not allow puns to be made on my calling.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) turned and walked away. I followed him (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>), shouting, `Yes, yes, you are an Ispravnik, not a Napravnik.' ' No,' he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) said, `since you called me a Napravnik
<p/>I am one.' And would you believe it, it ruined our business! And I'm always like that, always like that. Always injuring myself with my politeness.
<p/>Once, many years ago, I said to an influential person: `Your wife is a ticklish lady,' in an honorable sense, of the moral qualities, so to speak.
<p/>I thought I'd be polite, so I couldn't help saying, `Yes,' and he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) gave me a fine tickling on the spot.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) asked me, `Why, have you tickled her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?' Only that happened long ago, so I'm not ashamed to tell the story.
<p/>I'm always injuring myself like that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' You're doing it now,'' muttered Miüsov, with disgust. Father Zossima scrutinized them both in silence.
<p/>, I was aware of that, too, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, and let me tell you, indeed, I foresaw I should as soon as I began to speak.
<p/>'' Am I? Would you believe it And do you know I foresaw, too, that you'd be the first to remark on it.
<p/>The minute I see my joke isn't coming off, your reverence, both my cheeks feel as though they were drawn down to the lower jaw and there is almost a spasm in them.
<p/>I am an inveterate buffoon, and have been from birth up, your reverence, it's as though it were a craze in me.
<p/>That's been so since I was young, when I had to make jokes for my living in noblemen's families. I dare say it's a devil within me.
<p/>But only a little one. A more serious one would have chosen another lodging. But not your soul, Pyotr Alexandrovitch; you're not a lodging worth having either.
<p/>But I do believe--I believe in God, though I have had doubts of late. But now I sit and await words of wisdom.
<p/>Did you ever hear, most Holy Father, how Diderot went to see the Metropolitan Platon, in the time of the Empress Catherine?
<p/>To which the great bishop lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) finger and answered, `The fool hath said in his (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) heart there is no God.'
<p/>I'm like the philosopher, Diderot, your reverence. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went in and said straight out, `There is no God.' And he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fell down at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) feet on the spot. '
<p/>I believe,' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cried, `and will be christened.' And so he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was. Princess Dashkov was his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) godmother, and Potyomkin his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) godfather.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fyodor Pavlovitch, this is unbearable! You know you're telling lies and that that stupid anecdote isn't true. Why are you playing the fool?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miüsov/Pyotr Alexandrovitch/Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov</b></font>)</div>cried Miüsov in a shaking voice. '' I suspected all my life that it wasn't true,'' Fyodor Pavlovitch cried with conviction.
<p/>'' But I'll tell you the whole truth, gentlemen. Great elder! Forgive me, the last thing about Diderot's christening I made up just now.
<p/>I never thought of it before. I made it up to add piquancy. I play the fool, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, to make myself agreeable.
<p/>And as for Diderot, I heard as far as `the fool hath said in his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) heart' twenty times from the gentry about here when I was young.
<p/>Though I really don't know myself, sometimes, what I do it for. I heard your aunt, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, tell the story.
<p/>They all believe to this day that the infidel Diderot came to dispute about God with the Metropolitan Platon... '' Miüsov got up, forgetting himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) impatience.
<p/>For forty or fifty years past, from the times of former elders, no visitors had entered that cell without feelings of the profoundest veneration.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was furious, and conscious of being ridiculous. What was taking place in the cell was really incredible. Almost every one admitted to the cell
<p/>Of those visitors, many had been men of high rank and learning, some even freethinkers, attracted by curiosity, but all without exception had shown the profoundest reverence and delicacy, for here there was no question of money, but only, on the one side love and kindness, and on the other penitence and eager desire to decide some spiritual problem or crisis.
<p/>felt that a great favor was being shown him (<font color='blue'><b>visitors</b></font>). Many remained kneeling during the whole visit. So that such buffoonery amazed and bewildered the spectators, or at least some of them.
<p/>The monks, with unchanged countenances, waited, with earnest attention, to hear what the elder would say, but seemed on the point of standing up, like Miüsov.
<p/>What seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>visitors</b></font>) strangest of all was that his (<font color='blue'><b>visitors</b></font>) brother Ivan, on whom alone he (<font color='blue'><b>visitors</b></font>) had rested his (<font color='blue'><b>visitors</b></font>) hopes, and who alone had such influence on his (<font color='blue'><b>visitors</b></font>) father that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitors</b></font>) could have stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>visitors</b></font>), sat now quite unmoved, with downcast eyes, apparently waiting with interest to see how it would end, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>visitors</b></font>) had nothing to do with it.
<p/>Alyosha stood, with hanging head, on the verge of tears. Alyosha did not dare to look at Rakitin, the divinity student, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) knew almost intimately.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) alone in the monastery knew Rakitin's thoughts. '' Forgive me,'' began Miüsov, addressing Father Zossima, <div class="bookquote">``for perhaps I seem to be taking part in this shameful foolery.
<p/>I made a mistake in believing that even a man like Fyodor Pavlovitch would understand what was due on a visit to so honored a personage.
<p/>I did not suppose I should have to apologize simply for having come with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>)... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Zossima/Father Zossima/Father</b></font>)</div>Pyotr Alexandrovitch could say no more, and was about to leave the room, overwhelmed with confusion.
<p/>'' Don't distress yourself, I beg. '' The elder got on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) feeble legs, and taking Pyotr Alexandrovitch by both hands, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) sit down again.
<p/>'' I beg you not to disturb yourself. I particularly beg you to be my guest. '' And with a bow he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) went back and sat down again on his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) little sofa.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch cried suddenly, clutching the arms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) chair in both hands, as though ready to leap up from it if the answer were unfavorable.
<p/>'' Great elder, speak! Do I annoy you by my vivacity? '' '' I earnestly beg you, too, not to disturb yourself, and not to be uneasy,'' the elder said impressively.
<p/>'' Do not trouble. Make yourself quite at home. And, above all, do not be so ashamed of yourself, for that is at the root of it all.
<p/>'' ``Quite at home? To be my natural self? Oh, that is much too much, but I accept it with grateful joy.
<p/>Do you know, blessed Father, you'd better not invite me to be my natural self. Don't risk it.... I will not go so far as that myself.
<p/>Well, the rest is still plunged in the mists of uncertainty, though there are people who'd be pleased to describe me for you.
<p/>I warn you for your own sake. I mean that for you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. But as for you, holy being, let me tell you, I am brimming over with ecstasy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) got up, and throwing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hands, declaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Blessed be the womb that bare thee, and the paps that gave thee suck--the paps especially.
<p/>When you said just now, `Don't be so ashamed of yourself, for that is at the root of it all,' you pierced right through me by that remark, and read me to the core.
<p/>Indeed, I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffoon.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>So I say, `Let me really play the buffoon. I am not afraid of your opinion, for you are every one of you worse than I am.'
<p/>That is why I am a buffoon. It is from shame, great elder, from shame; it's simply over-sensitiveness that makes me rowdy.
<p/>If I had only been sure that every one would accept me as the kindest and wisest of men, oh, Lord, what a good man I should have been then!
<p/>Teacher! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) fell suddenly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) knees, <div class="bookquote">``what must I do to gain eternal life? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was difficult even now to decide whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was joking or really moved.
<p/>Father Zossima, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) eyes, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>), and said with a smile: <div class="bookquote">``You have known for a long time what you must do.
<p/>You have sense enough: don't give way to drunkenness and incontinence of speech; don't give way to sensual lust; and, above all, to the love of money.
<p/>And close your taverns. If you can't close all, at least two or three. And, above all--don't lie. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' You mean about Diderot?''
<p/>The man who lies to himself and listens to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own lie comes to such a pass that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot distinguish the truth within him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or around him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and so loses all respect for himself and for others.
<p/>And having no respect he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ceases to love, and in order to occupy and distract himself without love he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gives way to passions and coarse pleasures, and sinks to bestiality in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vices, all from continual lying to other men and to himself.
<p/>'' No, not about Diderot. Above all, don't lie to yourself. The man who lies to himself can be more easily offended than any one.
<p/>A man may know that nobody has insulted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has invented the insult for himself, has lied and exaggerated to make it picturesque, has caught at a word and made a mountain out of a molehill--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows that himself, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be the first to take offense, and will revel in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resentment till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feels great pleasure in it, and so pass to genuine vindictiveness.
<p/>You know it is sometimes very pleasant to take offense, isn't it? But get up, sit down, I beg you. All this, too, is deceitful posturing...
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Blessed man! Give me your hand to kiss. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div>Fyodor Pavlovitch skipped up, and imprinted a rapid kiss on the elder's thin hand.
<p/>Yes, I have been all my life taking offense, to please myself, taking offense on esthetic grounds, for it is not so much pleasant as distinguished sometimes to be insulted--that you had forgotten, great elder, it is distinguished!
<p/>'' It is, it is pleasant to take offense. You said that so well, as I never heard it before. I shall make a note of that.
<p/>But I have been lying, lying positively my whole life long, every day and hour of it. Of a truth, I am a lie, and the father of lies.
<p/>Though I believe I am not the father of lies. I am getting mixed in my texts. Say, the son of lies, and that will be enough.
<p/>Only ... my angel ... I may sometimes talk about Diderot! Diderot will do no harm, though sometimes a word will do harm.
<p/>Great elder, by the way, I was forgetting, though I had been meaning for the last two years to come here on purpose to ask and to find out something.
<p/>Here is my question: Is it true, great Father, that the story is told somewhere in the Lives of the Saints of a holy saint martyred for his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) faith who, when his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) head was cut off at last, stood up, picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) head, and, `courteously kissing it,' walked a long way, carrying it in his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Only do tell Pyotr Alexandrovitch not to interrupt me. Is that true or not, honored Father?'' '' No, it is untrue,'' said the elder.
<p/>'' There is nothing of the kind in all the lives of the saints. What saint do you say the story is told of?
<p/>'' asked the Father Librarian. '' I do not know what saint. I do not know, and can't tell. I was deceived.
<p/>I was told the story. I had heard it, and do you know who told it? Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov here, who was so angry just now about Diderot.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) it was who told the story. '' <div class="bookquote">``I have never told it you, I never speak to you at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is true you did not tell me, but you told it when I was present. It was three years ago.
<p/>You knew nothing of it, but I went home with my faith shaken, and I have been getting more and more shaken ever since.
<p/>I mentioned it because by that ridiculous story you shook my faith, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. Yes, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, you were the cause of a great fall.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch got excited and pathetic, though it was perfectly clear to every one by now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was playing a part again.
<p/>That was not a Diderot!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miüsov/Pyotr Alexandrovitch/Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov</b></font>)</div>Yet Miüsov was stung by his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) words. '' What nonsense, and it is all nonsense,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) muttered.
<p/>'' I may really have told it, some time or other ... but not to you. I was told it myself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) told me it was read at our mass from the Lives of the Saints ... he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was a very learned man who had made a special study of Russian statistics and had lived a long time in Russia....
<p/>I heard it in Paris from a Frenchman. I have not read the Lives of the Saints myself, and I am not going to read them ...
<p/>all sorts of things are said at dinner--we were dining then.'' ``Yes, you were dining then, and so I lost my faith!
<p/>Miüsov was on the point of shouting, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) suddenly checked himself, and said with contempt, <div class="bookquote">``You defile everything you touch.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Fyodor Pavlovitch, mimicking him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>). '' What do I care for your faith? '' '' The elder suddenly rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) seat.
<p/>'' Excuse me, gentlemen, for leaving you a few minutes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) said, addressing all his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) guests. '' I have visitors awaiting me who arrived before you.
<p/>But don't you tell lies all the same,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) added, turning to Fyodor Pavlovitch with a good-humored face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) went out of the cell.
<p/>Alyosha was breathless: he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was glad to get away, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was glad, too, that the elder was good-humored and not offended.
<p/>Alyosha and the novice flew to escort him (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) down the steps. Father Zossima was going towards the portico to bless the people waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) there.
<p/>But Fyodor Pavlovitch persisted in stopping him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) at the door of the cell. '' Blessed man! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, with feeling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Allow me to kiss your hand once more. Yes, with you I could still talk, I could still get on. Do you think I always lie and play the fool like this?

<p/>Is there room for my humility beside your pride? I am ready to give you a testimonial that one can get on with you!
<p/>But now, I'll be quiet; I will keep quiet all the time. I'll sit in a chair and hold my tongue.

<p/>Peasant Women Who Have Faith Near the wooden portico below, built on to the outer wall of the precinct, there was a crowd of about twenty peasant women.
<p/>Two ladies, Madame Hohlakov and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) daughter, had also come out into the portico to wait for the elder, but in a separate part of it set aside for women of rank.
<p/>They had been told that the elder was at last coming out, and they had gathered together in anticipation. Madame Hohlakov was a wealthy lady, still young and attractive, and always dressed with taste.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was rather pale, and had lively black eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not more than thirty-three, and had been five years a widow.
<p/>The poor child had not been able to walk for the last six months, and was wheeled about in a long reclining chair.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) daughter, a girl of fourteen, was partially paralyzed. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had a charming little face, rather thin from illness, but full of gayety.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) mother had been intending to take her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) abroad ever since the spring, but they had been detained all the summer by business connected with their estate.
<p/>They had been staying a week in our town, where they had come more for purposes of business than devotion, but had visited Father Zossima once already, three days before.
<p/>Though they knew that the elder scarcely saw any one, they had now suddenly turned up again, and urgently entreated <div class="bookquote">``the happiness of looking once again on the great healer.
<p/>The mother was sitting on a chair by the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter's invalid carriage, and two paces from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stood an old monk, not one of our monastery, but a visitor from an obscure religious house in the far north.
<p/>There was a gleam of mischief in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) big dark eyes with their long lashes. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) too sought the elder's blessing.
<p/>But Father Zossima, on entering the portico, went first straight to the peasants who were crowded at the foot of the three steps that led up into the portico.
<p/>Father Zossima stood on the top step, put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) stole, and began blessing the women who thronged about him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>). One crazy woman was led up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>).
<p/>As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) caught sight of the elder she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began shrieking and writhing as though in the pains of childbirth.
<p/>Laying the stole on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) forehead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) read a short prayer over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was at once soothed and quieted.
<p/>I do not know how it may be now, but in my childhood I often happened to see and hear these <div class="bookquote">``possessed''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>women in the villages and monasteries.
<p/>They used to be brought to mass; they would squeal and bark like a dog so that they were heard all over the church.
<p/>But when the sacrament was carried in and they were led up to it, at once the <div class="bookquote">``possession''  (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>ceased, and the sick women were always soothed for a time.
<p/>I was greatly impressed and amazed at this as a child; but then I heard from country neighbors and from my town teachers that the whole illness was simulated to avoid work, and that it could always be cured by suitable severity; various anecdotes were told to confirm this.
<p/>But later on I learnt with astonishment from medical specialists that there is no pretense about it, that it is a terrible illness to which women are subject, specially prevalent among us in Russia, and that it is due to the hard lot of the peasant women.
<p/>It is a disease, I was told, arising from exhausting toil too soon after hard, abnormal and unassisted labor in childbirth, and from the hopeless misery, from beatings, and so on, which some women were not able to endure like others.
<p/>The strange and instant healing of the frantic and struggling woman as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was led up to the holy sacrament, which had been explained to me as due to malingering and the trickery of the <div class="bookquote">``clericals,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>arose probably in the most natural manner.
<p/>Both the women who supported her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and the invalid herself fully believed as a truth beyond question that the evil spirit in possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not hold out if the sick woman were brought to the sacrament and made to bow down before it.
<p/>And so, with a nervous and psychically deranged woman, a sort of convulsion of the whole organism always took place, and was bound to take place, at the moment of bowing down to the sacrament, aroused by the expectation of the miracle of healing and the implicit belief that it would come to pass; and it did come to pass, though only for a moment.
<p/>Many of the women in the crowd were moved to tears of ecstasy by the effect of the moment: some strove to kiss the hem of his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) garment, others cried out in sing-song voices.
<p/>It was exactly the same now as soon as the elder touched the sick woman with the stole. He (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) blessed them all and talked with some of them.
<p/>The <div class="bookquote">``possessed''  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>woman he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) knew already. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came from a village only six versts from the monastery, and had been brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) pointed to a woman by no means old but very thin and wasted, with a face not merely sunburnt but almost blackened by exposure.
<p/>'' But here is one from afar. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was kneeling and gazing with a fixed stare at the elder; there was something almost frenzied in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' From afar off, Father, from afar off! From two hundred miles from here. From afar off, Father, from afar off!
<p/>'' the woman began in a sing-song voice as though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were chanting a dirge, swaying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head from side to side with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheek resting in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand.
<p/>But there is a grief that breaks out, and from that minute it bursts into tears and finds vent in wailing.
<p/>There is silent and long-suffering sorrow to be met with among the peasantry. It withdraws into itself and is still. This is particularly common with women.
<p/>But it is no lighter a grief than the silent. Lamentations comfort only by lacerating the heart still more. Such grief does not desire consolation.
<p/>It feeds on the sense of its hopelessness. Lamentations spring only from the constant craving to reopen the wound. '' You are of the tradesman class?'' said Father Zossima, looking curiously at her (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>).
<p/>'' Townfolk we are, Father, townfolk. Yet we are peasants though we live in the town. I have come to see you, O Father!
<p/>We heard of you, Father, we heard of you. I have buried my little son, and I have come on a pilgrimage.
<p/>I have been in three monasteries, but they told me, `Go, Nastasya, go to them'--that is to you. I have come; I was yesterday at the service, and to-day I have come to you.
<p/>'' '' What are you weeping for?'' '' It's my little son I'm grieving for, Father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was three years old--three years all but three months.
<p/>For my little boy, Father, I'm in anguish, for my little boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was the last one left. We had four, my Nikita and I, and now we've no children
<p/>, our dear ones have all gone. I buried the first three without grieving overmuch, and now I have buried the last I can't forget him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) seems always standing before me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) never leaves me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) has withered my heart. I look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) little clothes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) little shirt, his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) little boots, and I wail.
<p/>I lay out all that is left of him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), all his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) little things. I look at them and wail. I say to Nikita, my husband, `Let me go on a pilgrimage, master.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is a driver. We're not poor people, Father, not poor; he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) drives our own horse. It's all our own, the horse and the carriage.
<p/>And what good is it all to us now? My Nikita has begun drinking while I am away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'s sure to.
<p/>It used to be so before. As soon as I turn my back he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) gives way to it. But now I don't think about him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).
<p/>It's three months since I left home. I've forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>). I've forgotten everything. I don't want to remember. And what would our life be now together?
<p/>I've done with him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), I've done. I've done with them all. I don't care to look upon my house and my goods.
<p/>Once in olden times a holy saint saw in the Temple a mother like you weeping for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) little one, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) only one, whom God had taken. '
<p/>I don't care to see anything at all!'' <div class="bookquote">``Listen, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the elder. '' Knowest thou not,' said the saint to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), `how bold these little ones are before the throne of God?
<p/>Thou didst give us life, O Lord,'' they say, <div class="bookquote">``and scarcely had we looked upon it when Thou didst take it back again.
<p/>Verily there are none bolder than they in the Kingdom of Heaven. ''  (<font color='red'><b>O Lord</b></font>)</div>'' And so boldly they ask and ask again that God gives them at once the rank of angels.
<p/>Therefore,' said the saint, `thou, too, O mother, rejoice and weep not, for thy little son is with the Lord in the fellowship of the angels.'
<p/>That's what the saint said to the weeping mother of old. He (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) was a great saint and he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) could not have spoken falsely.
<p/>Therefore you too, mother, know that your little one is surely before the throne of God, is rejoicing and happy, and praying to God for you, and therefore weep not, but rejoice.
<p/>'' The woman listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), looking down with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheek in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sighed deeply. '' My Nikita tried to comfort me with the same words as you. '
<p/>Foolish one,' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, `why weep? Our son is no doubt singing with the angels before God.' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) says that to me, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) weeps himself.
<p/>I see that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cries like me. ' I know, Nikita,' said I. `Where could he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) be if not with the Lord God?
<p/>And if only I could look upon him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) one little time, if only I could peep at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) one little time, without going up to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), without speaking, if I could be hidden in a corner and only see him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) for one little minute, hear him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) playing in the yard, calling in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) little voice, `Mammy, where are you?'
<p/>If only I could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pattering with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) little feet about the room just once, only once; for so often, so often I remember how he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) used to run to me and shout and laugh, if only I could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) little feet I should know him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!
<p/>Only, here with us now he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is not as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) used to sit beside us before.' But he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s gone, Father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'s gone, and I shall never hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) drew out of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bosom her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) boy's little embroidered sash, and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked at it she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) began shaking with sobs, hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fingers through which the tears flowed in a sudden stream.
<p/>It is Rachel of old,'' said the elder, <div class="bookquote">``weeping for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) children, and will not be comforted because they are not.
<p/>Here's his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) little sash, but him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) I shall never see or hear now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Rachel</b></font>)</div>'' Such is the lot set on earth for you mothers.
<p/>Only every time that you weep be sure to remember that your little son is one of the angels of God, that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) looks down from there at you and sees you, and rejoices at your tears, and points at them to the Lord God; and a long while yet will you keep that great mother's grief.
<p/>But it will turn in the end into quiet joy, and your bitter tears will be only tears of tender sorrow that purifies the heart and delivers it from sin.
<p/>Be not comforted. Consolation is not what you need. Weep and be not consoled, but weep. And I shall pray for the peace of your child's soul.
<p/>What was his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) name?'' <div class="bookquote">``Alexey, Father.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A sweet name. After Alexey, the man of God?''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, Father.'' '' What a saint he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was!
<p/>I will remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), mother, and your grief in my prayers, and I will pray for your husband's health. It is a sin for you to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>Your little one will see from heaven that you have forsaken his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) father, and will weep over you. Why do you trouble his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) happiness?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is living, for the soul lives for ever, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is not in the house he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is near you, unseen.
<p/>How can he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) go into the house when you say that the house is hateful to you? To whom is he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to go if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) find you not together, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) father and mother?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) comes to you in dreams now, and you grieve. But then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) will send you gentle dreams. Go to your husband, mother; go this very day.
<p/>My Nikita, my Nikita, you are waiting for me,'' the woman began in a sing-song voice; but the elder had already turned away to a very old woman, dressed like a dweller in the town, not like a pilgrim.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I will go, Father, at your word. I will go. You've gone straight to my heart. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes showed that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had come with an object, and in order to say something.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was the widow of a non-commissioned officer, and lived close by in the town. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son Vasenka was in the commissariat service, and had gone to Irkutsk in Siberia.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had written twice from there, but now a year had passed since he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had written.

<p/>Only the other day Stepanida Ilyinishna--she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s a rich merchant's wife--said to me, `You go, Prohorovna, and put your son's name down for prayer in the church, and pray for the peace of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) soul as though he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) were dead.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) soul will be troubled,' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, `and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will write you a letter.' And Stepanida Ilyinishna told me it was a certain thing which had been many times tried.
<p/>Only I am in doubt.... Oh, you light of ours! is it true or false, and would it be right?'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't think of it.
<p/>It's shameful to ask the question. How is it possible to pray for the peace of a living soul? And his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own mother too!
<p/>Better pray to the Queen of Heaven, our swift defense and help, for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) good health, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) may forgive you for your error.
<p/>It's a great sin, akin to sorcery. Only for your ignorance it is forgiven you. And another thing I will tell you, Prohorovna.
<p/>Either he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will soon come back to you, your son, or he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will be sure to send a letter. Go, and henceforward be in peace.
<p/>Your son is alive, I tell you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dear Father God</b></font>)</div>'' Dear Father, God reward you, our benefactor, who prays for all of us and for our sins!''
<p/>But the elder had already noticed in the crowd two glowing eyes fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>). An exhausted, consumptive-looking, though young peasant woman was gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) in silence.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes besought him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed afraid to approach. '' What is it, my child?'' <div class="bookquote">``Absolve my soul, Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) articulated softly, and slowly sank on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knees and bowed down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) feet.
<p/>'' I have sinned, Father. I am afraid of my sin. '' The elder sat down on the lower step. The woman crept closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), still on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knees.
<p/>'' I am a widow these three years,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began in a half-whisper, with a sort of shudder. '' I had a hard life with my husband.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lay ill; I thought looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) were to get well, if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) were to get up again, what then?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was an old man. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) used to beat me cruelly. And then the thought came to me-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Stay! ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said the elder, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ear close to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips.
<p/>The woman went on in a low whisper, so that it was almost impossible to catch anything. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had soon done.
<p/>'' Three years ago?'' asked the elder. '' Three years. At first I didn't think about it, but now I've begun to be ill, and the thought never leaves me.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fear nothing and never be afraid; and don't fret. If only your penitence fail not, God will forgive all. Man cannot commit a sin so great as to exhaust the infinite love of God.
<p/>Can there be a sin which could exceed the love of God? Think only of repentance, continual repentance, but dismiss fear altogether.
<p/>It has been said of old that over one repentant sinner there is more joy in heaven than over ten righteous men.
<p/>Believe that God loves you as you cannot conceive; that He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) loves you with your sin, in your sin. Go, and fear not.
<p/>Be not bitter against men. Be not angry if you are wronged. Forgive the dead man in your heart what wrong he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did you.
<p/>Be reconciled with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in truth. If you are penitent, you love. And if you love you are of God. All things are atoned for, all things are saved by love.
<p/>If I, a sinner, even as you are, am tender with you and have pity on you, how much more will God.
<p/>Love is such a priceless treasure that you can redeem the whole world by it, and expiate not only your own sins but the sins of others.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) signed her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) three times with the cross, took from his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own neck a little ikon and put it upon her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>Faith A visitor looking on the scene of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) conversation with the peasants and his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) blessing them shed silent tears and wiped them away with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) handkerchief.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) blessed them all and bowed low to them. Chapter IV. A Lady Of Little She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was a sentimental society lady of genuinely good disposition in many respects.
<p/>When the elder went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) enthusiastically. '' Ah, what I have been feeling, looking on at this touching scene!...
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) could not go on for emotion. '' Oh, I understand the people's love for you. I love the people myself.
<p/>I want to love them. And who could help loving them, our splendid Russian people, so simple in their greatness!'' <div class="bookquote">``How is your daughter's health?
<p/>You wanted to talk to me again?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, I have been urgently begging for it, I have prayed for it!
<p/>I was ready to fall on my knees and kneel for three days at your windows until you let me in.
<p/>You have healed my Lise, healed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) completely, merely by praying over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) last Thursday and laying your hands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>).
<p/>We have come, great healer, to express our ardent gratitude. We have hastened here to kiss those hands, to pour out our feelings and our homage.''
<p/>'' What do you mean by healed? But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) is still lying down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) chair.'' '' But her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) night fevers have entirely ceased ever since Thursday,'' said the lady with nervous haste.
<p/>'' And that's not all. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) legs are stronger. This morning she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) got up well; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had slept all night. Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rosy cheeks, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bright eyes!
<p/>This morning she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) insisted on my letting her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stand up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stood up for a whole minute without any support.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) used to be always crying, but now she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) laughs and is gay and happy. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wagers that in a fortnight she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'ll be dancing a quadrille.
<p/>I've called in Doctor Herzenstube. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) shoulders and said, 'I am amazed; I can make nothing of it.' And would you have us not come here to disturb you, not fly here to thank you?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rose in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chair as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could and, looking at the elder, clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands before him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), but could not restrain herself and broke into laughter.
<p/>It's at him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>),'' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, pointing to Alyosha, with childish vexation at herself for not being able to repress her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mirth.
<p/>If any one had looked at Alyosha standing a step behind the elder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) would have caught a quick flush crimsoning his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) cheeks in an instant.
<p/>Lise, thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)--thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>)!'' Lise's pretty little laughing face became suddenly serious. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eyes shone and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) looked down. ''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) has a message for you, Alexey Fyodorovitch. How are you? '' the mother went on, holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exquisitely gloved hand to Alyosha.
<p/>The elder turned round and all at once looked attentively at Alyosha. The latter went nearer to Lise and, smiling in a strangely awkward way, held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) too.
<p/>Lise assumed an important air. '' Katerina Ivanovna has sent you this through me. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) a little note.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) particularly begs you to go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) as soon as possible; that you will not fail her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), but will be sure to come.''

(<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha muttered in great astonishment. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) face at once looked anxious.
<p/>'' Oh, it's all to do with Dmitri Fyodorovitch and--what has happened lately,'' the mother explained hurriedly. '' Katerina Ivanovna has made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) mind, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) must see you about it....
<p/>Why, of course, I can't say. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) wants to see you at once. And you will go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), of course.
<p/>It is a Christian duty.'' <div class="bookquote">``I have only seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha protested with the same perplexity.

<p/>If only for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) suffering.... Think what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) has gone through, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is enduring now! Think what awaits her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)! It's all terrible, terrible!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, I will come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha decided, after rapidly scanning the brief, enigmatic note, which consisted of an urgent entreaty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would come, without any sort of explanation.
<p/>'' Oh, how sweet and generous that would be of you! '' cried Lise with sudden animation. '' I told mamma you'd be sure not to go.
<p/>I said you were saving your soul. How splendid you are! I've always thought you were splendid. How glad I am to tell you so!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lise! ''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) mother impressively, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) smiled after she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) had said it. '' You have quite forgotten us, Alexey Fyodorovitch,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``you never come to see us.
<p/>Yet Lise has told me twice that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) is never happy except with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Alyosha raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) downcast eyes and again flushed, and again smiled without knowing why.
<p/>But the elder was no longer watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had begun talking to a monk who, as mentioned before, had been awaiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) entrance by Lise's chair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was evidently a monk of the humblest, that is of the peasant, class, of a narrow outlook, but a true believer, and, in his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) own way, a stubborn one.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) announced that he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) had come from the far north, from Obdorsk, from Saint Sylvester, and was a member of a poor monastery, consisting of only ten monks.
<p/>The elder gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvester</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvester</b></font>) blessing and invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvester</b></font>) to come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvester</b></font>) cell whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvester</b></font>) liked. '' How can you presume to do such deeds?
<p/>'' the monk asked suddenly, pointing solemnly and significantly at Lise. He (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) was referring to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``healing.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' It's too early, of course, to speak of that.
<p/>Relief is not complete cure, and may proceed from different causes. But if there has been any healing, it is by no power
<p/>but God's will. It's all from God. Visit me, Father,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) added to the monk. '' It's not often I can see visitors.
<p/>I am ill, and I know that my days are numbered.'' '' Oh, no, no! God will not take you from us.
<p/>You will live a long, long time yet,'' cried the lady. '' And in what way are you ill? You look so well, so gay and happy.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am extraordinarily better to-day. But I know that it's only for a moment. I understand my disease now thoroughly. If I seem so happy to you, you could never say anything that would please me so much.

<p/>All the righteous, all the saints, all the holy martyrs were happy.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, how you speak! What bold and lofty words!'' cried the lady.
<p/>'' You seem to pierce with your words. And yet--happiness, happiness--where is it? Who can say of himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is happy?
<p/>Oh, since you have been so good as to let us see you once more to-day, let me tell you what I could not utter last time, what I dared not say, all I am suffering and have been for so long!
<p/>I am suffering! Forgive me! I am suffering! '' And in a rush of fervent feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands before him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>'' From what specially?'' <div class="bookquote">``I suffer ... from lack of faith.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Lack of faith in God?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, no, no! I dare not even think of that.
<p/>You are a healer, you are deeply versed in the human soul, and of course I dare not expect you to believe me entirely, but I assure you on my word of honor that I am not speaking lightly now.
<p/>But the future life--it is such an enigma! And no one, no one can solve it. Listen! The thought of the life beyond the grave distracts me to anguish, to terror.
<p/>And I don't know to whom to appeal, and have not dared to all my life. And now I am so bold as to ask you.
<p/>Oh, God! What will you think of me now? '' She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hands. '' Don't distress yourself about my opinion of you,'' said the elder.
<p/>'' I quite believe in the sincerity of your suffering.'' '' Oh, how thankful I am to you! You see, I shut my eyes and ask myself if every one has faith, where did it come from?
<p/>And then they do say that it all comes from terror at the menacing phenomena of nature, and that none of it's real.
<p/>And I say to myself, `What if I've been believing all my life, and when I come to die there's nothing but the burdocks growing on my grave?' as I read in some author.
<p/>It's awful! How--how can I get back my faith? But I only believed when I was a little child, mechanically, without thinking of anything.
<p/>How, how is one to prove it? I have come now to lay my soul before you and to ask you about it.
<p/>If I let this chance slip, no one all my life will answer me. How can I prove it? How can I convince myself?
<p/>I stand and look about me and see that scarcely any one else cares; no one troubles his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head about it, and I'm the only one who can't stand it.
<p/>Oh, how unhappy I am! It's deadly--deadly!'' <div class="bookquote">``No doubt. But there's no proving it, though you can be convinced of it.
<p/>In as far as you advance in love you will grow surer of the reality of God and of the immortality of your soul.
<p/>If you attain to perfect self-forgetfulness in the love of your neighbor, then you will believe without doubt, and no doubt can possibly enter your soul.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' By the experience of active love. Strive to love your neighbor actively and indefatigably. This has been tried.
<p/>You see, I so love humanity that--would you believe it?--I often dream of forsaking all that I have, leaving Lise, and becoming a sister of mercy.
<p/>I close my eyes and think and dream, and at that moment I feel full of strength to overcome all obstacles.
<p/>This is certain.'' <div class="bookquote">``In active love? There's another question--and such a question! No wounds, no festering sores could at that moment frighten me.
<p/>I would bind them up and wash them with my own hands. I would nurse the afflicted. I would be ready to kiss such wounds.''
 (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div><p/>'' It is much, and well that your mind is full of such dreams and not others. Sometime, unawares, you may do a good deed in reality.''
<p/>'' Yes. But could I endure such a life for long? '' the lady went on fervently, almost frantically. '' That's the chief question--that's my most agonizing question.
<p/>And if the patient whose wounds you are washing did not meet you with gratitude, but worried you with his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) whims, without valuing or remarking your charitable services, began abusing you and rudely commanding you, and complaining to the superior authorities of you -LRB-which often happens when people are in great suffering-RRB---what then?
<p/>I shut my eyes and ask myself, `Would you persevere long on that path? Would you persevere in your love, or not?'
<p/>And do you know, I came with horror to the conclusion that, if anything could dissipate my love to humanity, it would be ingratitude.
<p/>In short, I am a hired servant, I expect my payment at once--that is, praise, and the repayment of love with love.
<p/>Otherwise I am incapable of loving any one. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was in a very paroxysm of self-castigation, and, concluding, she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) looked with defiant resolution at the elder.
<p/>'' It's just the same story as a doctor once told me,'' observed the elder. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was a man getting on in years, and undoubtedly clever.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) spoke as frankly as you, though in jest, in bitter jest. ' I love humanity,' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said, `but I wonder at myself.
<p/>In my dreams,' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said, 'I have often come to making enthusiastic schemes for the service of humanity, and perhaps I might actually have faced crucifixion if it had been suddenly necessary; and yet I am incapable of living in the same room with any one for two days together, as I know by experience.
<p/>The more I love humanity in general, the less I love man in particular. As soon as any one is near me, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) personality disturbs my self-complacency and restricts my freedom.
<p/>In twenty-four hours I begin to hate the best of men: one because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s too long over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dinner; another because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a cold and keeps on blowing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose.
<p/>But it has always happened that the more I detest men individually the more ardent becomes my love for humanity.' ''
<p/>I become hostile to people the moment they come close to me. '' But what's to be done? What can one do in such a case?
<p/>Must one despair?'' '' No. It is enough that you are distressed at it. Do what you can, and it will be reckoned unto you.
<p/>If you have been talking to me so sincerely, simply to gain approbation for your frankness, as you did from me just now, then of course you will not attain to anything in the achievement of real love; it will all get no further than dreams, and your whole life will slip away like a phantom.
<p/>In that case you will naturally cease to think of the future life too, and will of yourself grow calmer after a fashion in the end.
<p/>Only now, as you speak, I understand that I was really only seeking your approbation for my sincerity when I told you I could not endure ingratitude.
<p/>Much is done already in you since you can so deeply and sincerely know yourself. '' <div class="bookquote">``You have crushed me! You have revealed me to myself.
<p/>You have seen through me and explained me to myself!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you speaking the truth? Well, now, after such a confession, I believe that you are sincere and good at heart.
<p/>If you do not attain happiness, always remember that you are on the right road, and try not to leave it.
<p/>Above all, avoid falsehood, every kind of falsehood, especially falseness to yourself. Watch over your own deceitfulness and look into it every hour, every minute.
<p/>Avoid being scornful, both to others and to yourself. What seems to you bad within you will grow purer from the very fact of your observing it in yourself.
<p/>Avoid fear, too, though fear is only the consequence of every sort of falsehood. Never be frightened at your own faint-heartedness in attaining love.
<p/>I am sorry I can say nothing more consoling to you, for love in action is a harsh and dreadful thing compared with love in dreams.
<p/>Don't be frightened overmuch even at your evil actions. Love in dreams is greedy for immediate action, rapidly performed and in the sight of all.
<p/>Men will even give their lives if only the ordeal does not last long but is soon over, with all looking on and applauding as though on the stage.
<p/>But I predict that just when you see with horror that in spite of all your efforts you are getting farther from your goal instead of nearer to it--at that very moment I predict that you will reach it and behold clearly the miraculous power of the Lord who has been all the time loving and mysteriously guiding you.
<p/>But active love is labor and fortitude, and for some people too, perhaps, a complete science. Forgive me for not being able to stay longer with you.
<p/>They are waiting for me. Good-by. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div>The lady was weeping. '' Lise, Lise! Bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>)--bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>)!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) cried, starting up suddenly.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) does not deserve to be loved. I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) naughtiness all along,'' the elder said jestingly. '' Why have you been laughing at Alexey?''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) had noticed before that Alyosha was shy and tried not to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) found this extremely amusing.
<p/>Alyosha, unable to endure her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) persistent stare, was irresistibly and suddenly drawn to glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>), and at once she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) smiled triumphantly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) face.
<p/>Lise had in fact been occupied in mocking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) all the time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) waited intently to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) eye. Alyosha was even more disconcerted and vexed.
<p/>After a few minutes, drawn by the same irresistible force, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) turned again to see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) was being looked at or not, and found Lise almost hanging out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) chair to peep sideways at him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>), eagerly waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) to look.
<p/>Catching his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) eye, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) laughed so that the elder could not help saying, <div class="bookquote">``Why do you make fun of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) like that, naughty girl?
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) turned away from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) altogether and hid behind the elder's back. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Lise suddenly and quite unexpectedly blushed.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) eyes flashed and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) face became quite serious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) began speaking quickly and nervously in a warm and resentful voice: <div class="bookquote">``Why has he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) forgotten everything, then?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) used to carry me about when I was little. We used to play together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) used to come to teach me to read, do you know.
<p/>Two years ago, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) went away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) would never forget me, that we were friends for ever, for ever, for ever!
<p/>And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>)'s afraid of me all at once. Am I going to eat him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>)? Why doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) want to come near me?
<p/>Why doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) talk? Why won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) come and see us? It's not that you won't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>). We know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) goes everywhere.
<p/>It's not good manners for me to invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) ought to have thought of it first, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) hasn't forgotten me.
<p/>No, now he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>)'s saving his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) soul! Why have you put that long gown on him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>)? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) runs he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>)'ll fall. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>And suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) hand and went off into irresistible, prolonged, nervous, inaudible laughter. The elder listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) with a smile, and blessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) tenderly.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) suddenly pressed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) eyes and began crying. '' Don't be angry with me.
<p/>I'm silly and good for nothing ... and perhaps Alyosha's right, quite right, in not wanting to come and see such a ridiculous girl.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I will certainly send him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the elder. Chapter V. So Be It! So Be It! The elder's absence from his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) cell had lasted for about twenty-five minutes.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) seemed almost to be forgotten, and when the elder entered the cell again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) guests engaged in eager conversation.
<p/>It was more than half-past twelve, but Dmitri, on whose account they had all met there, had still not appeared. Ivan and the two monks took the leading share in it.
<p/>Miüsov, too, was trying to take a part, and apparently very eagerly, in the conversation. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was unsuccessful in this also.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was evidently in the background, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) remarks were treated with neglect, which increased his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) irritability. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had had intellectual encounters with Ivan before and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) could not endure a certain carelessness Ivan showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>Hitherto at least I have stood in the front ranks of all that is progressive in Europe, and here the new generation positively ignores us,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) thought.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch, who had given his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) word to sit still and be quiet, had actually been quiet for some time, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) neighbor Miüsov with an ironical little smile, obviously enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) discomfiture.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had been waiting for some time to pay off old scores, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) could not let the opportunity slip.
<p/>'' Bending over his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) shoulder he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) began teasing him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) again in a whisper. '' Why didn't you go away just now, after the `courteously kissing'?
<p/>Why did you consent to remain in such unseemly company? It was because you felt insulted and aggrieved, and you remained to vindicate yourself by showing off your intelligence.
<p/>Now you won't go till you've displayed your intellect to them.'' <div class="bookquote">``You again?... On the contrary, I'm just going. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You'll be the last, the last of all to go!
<p/>The discussion died down for a moment, but the elder, seating himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) former place, looked at them all as though cordially inviting them to go on.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div>Fyodor Pavlovitch delivered him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) another thrust, almost at the moment of Father Zossima's return. Alyosha, who knew every expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) face, saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) was fearfully exhausted and making a great effort.
<p/>Of late he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) had been liable to fainting fits from exhaustion. His (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) face had the pallor that was common before such attacks, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) lips were white.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) evidently did not want to break up the party. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) seemed to have some special object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) own in keeping them.
<p/>What object? Alyosha watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) intently. '' We are discussing this gentleman's most interesting article,'' said Father Iosif, the librarian, addressing the elder, and indicating Ivan.
<p/>It is an article written in answer to a book by an ecclesiastical authority on the question of the ecclesiastical court, and the scope of its jurisdiction.''
<p/>I'm sorry I have not read your article, but I've heard of it,'' said the elder, looking keenly and intently at Ivan.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brings forward much that is new, but I think the argument cuts both ways. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) takes up a most interesting position,'' continued the Father Librarian.
<p/>'' As far as Church jurisdiction is concerned he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is apparently quite opposed to the separation of Church from State. ''
<p/>The latter, at last, answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), not condescendingly, as Alyosha had feared, but with modesty and reserve, with evident goodwill and apparently without the slightest arričre-pensée .
<p/>I start from the position that this confusion of elements, that is, of the essential principles of Church and State, will, of course, go on for ever, in spite of the fact that it is impossible for them to mingle, and that the confusion of these elements cannot lead to any consistent or even normal results, for there is falsity at the very foundation of it.
<p/>Compromise between the Church and State in such questions as, for instance, jurisdiction, is, to my thinking, impossible in any real sense.
<p/>'' That's interesting. But in what sense? '' Father Zossima asked Ivan. '' My clerical opponent maintains that the Church holds a precise and defined position in the State.
<p/>I maintain, on the contrary, that the Church ought to include the whole State, and not simply to occupy a corner in it, and, if this is, for some reason, impossible at present, then it ought, in reality, to be set up as the direct and chief aim of the future development of Christian society!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perfectly true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>Father Paďssy, the silent and learned monk, assented with fervor and decision. '' The purest Ultramontanism! '' cried Miüsov impatiently, crossing and recrossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) legs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Observe the answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) makes to the following `fundamental and essential' propositions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) opponent, who is, you must note, an ecclesiastic.
<p/>First, that `no social organization can or ought to arrogate to itself power to dispose of the civic and political rights of its members.'
<p/>Secondly, that `criminal and civil jurisdiction ought not to belong to the Church, and is inconsistent with its nature, both as a divine institution and as an organization of men for religious objects,' and, finally, in the third place, `the Church is a kingdom not of this world.'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>Oh, well, we have no mountains,'' cried Father Iosif, and turning to the elder he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) continued: '' <div class="bookquote">``A most unworthy play upon words for an ecclesiastic!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I have read the book which you have answered,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) added, addressing Ivan, <div class="bookquote">``and was astounded at the words `the Church is a kingdom not of this world.'
<p/>Father Paďssy could not refrain from breaking in again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>If it is not of this world, then it cannot exist on earth at all.
<p/>In the Gospel, the words `not of this world' are not used in that sense. To play with such words is indefensible.
<p/>The Kingdom of Heaven, of course, is not of this world, but in Heaven; but it is only entered through the Church which has been founded and established upon earth.
<p/>Our Lord Jesus Christ came to set up the Church upon earth. And so a frivolous play upon words in such a connection is unpardonable and improper.
<p/>The Church is, in truth, a kingdom and ordained to rule, and in the end must undoubtedly become the kingdom ruling over all the earth.
<p/>After listening attentively and respectfully Ivan went on, addressing the elder with perfect composure and as before with ready cordiality: <div class="bookquote">``The whole point of my article lies in the fact that during the first three centuries Christianity only existed on earth in the Church and was nothing but the Church.
<p/>When the pagan Roman Empire desired to become Christian, it inevitably happened that, by becoming Christian, it included the Church but remained a pagan State in very many of its departments.
<p/>For that we have the divine promise. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>pagan</b></font>) ceased speaking suddenly, as though checking himself. In reality this was bound to happen.
<p/>But Rome as a State retained too much of the pagan civilization and culture, as, for example, in the very objects and fundamental principles of the State.
<p/>The Christian Church entering into the State could, of course, surrender no part of its fundamental principles--the rock on which it stands--and could pursue no other aims than those which have been ordained and revealed by God Himself, and among them that of drawing the whole world, and therefore the ancient pagan State itself, into the Church.
<p/>In that way -LRB-that is, with a view to the future-RRB- it is not the Church that should seek a definite position in the State, like `every social organization,' or as `an organization of men for religious purposes' -LRB-as my opponent calls the Church-RRB-, but, on the contrary, every earthly State should be, in the end, completely transformed into the Church and should become nothing else but a Church, rejecting every purpose incongruous with the aims of the Church.
<p/>All this will not degrade it in any way or take from its honor and glory as a great State, nor from the glory of its rulers, but only turns it from a false, still pagan, and mistaken path to the true and rightful path, which alone leads to the eternal goal.
<p/>This is why the author of the book On the Foundations of Church Jurisdiction would have judged correctly if, in seeking and laying down those foundations, he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) had looked upon them as a temporary compromise inevitable in our sinful and imperfect days.
<p/>But as soon as the author ventures to declare that the foundations which he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) predicates now, part of which Father Iosif just enumerated, are the permanent, essential, and eternal foundations, he (<font color='blue'><b>Iosif</b></font>) is going directly against the Church and its sacred and eternal vocation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is, in brief,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>Father Paďssy began again, laying stress on each word, <div class="bookquote">``according to certain theories only too clearly formulated in the nineteenth century, the Church ought to be transformed into the State, as though this would be an advance from a lower to a higher form, so as to disappear into it, making way for science, for the spirit of the age, and civilization.
<p/>And if the Church resists and is unwilling, some corner will be set apart for her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) in the State, and even that under control--and this will be so everywhere in all modern European countries.
<p/>But Russian hopes and conceptions demand not that the Church should pass as from a lower into a higher type into the State, but, on the contrary, that the State should end by being worthy to become only the Church and nothing else.
<p/>That is the gist of my article.''  (<font color='red'><b>Paďssy/Father Paďssy</b></font>)</div>So be it! So be it!'' '' Well, I confess you've reassured me somewhat,'' Miüsov said smiling, again crossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) legs.
<p/>So far as I understand, then, the realization of such an ideal is infinitely remote, at the second coming of Christ.
<p/>It's a beautiful Utopian dream of the abolition of war, diplomacy, banks, and so on--something after the fashion of socialism, indeed.
<p/>But I imagined that it was all meant seriously, and that the Church might be now going to try criminals, and sentence them to beating, prison, and even death.''
<p/>But if there were none but the ecclesiastical court, the Church would not even now sentence a criminal to prison or to death.
<p/>Crime and the way of regarding it would inevitably change, not all at once of course, but fairly soon,'' Ivan replied calmly, without flinching.
<p/>If everything became the Church, the Church would exclude all the criminal and disobedient, and would not cut off their heads,'' Ivan went on.
<p/>'' That's as you please. '' <div class="bookquote">``Are you serious?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miüsov/Pyotr Alexandrovitch/Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov</b></font>)</div>Miüsov glanced keenly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). '' '' I ask you, what would become of the excluded?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) would be cut off then not only from men, as now, but from Christ. By his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) crime he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) would have transgressed not only against men but against the Church of Christ.
<p/>This is so even now, of course, strictly speaking, but it is not clearly enunciated, and very, very often the criminal of to-day compromises with his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) conscience: 'I steal,' he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) says, `but I don't go against the Church.
<p/>That's what the criminal of to-day is continually saying to himself, but when the Church takes the place of the State it will be difficult for him (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>), in opposition to the Church all over the world, to say: `All men are mistaken, all in error, all mankind are the false Church.
<p/>I'm not an enemy of Christ.' I, a thief and murderer, am the only true Christian Church.' It will be very difficult to say this to himself; it requires a rare combination of unusual circumstances.
<p/>Now, on the other side, take the Church's own view of crime: is it not bound to renounce the present almost pagan attitude, and to change from a mechanical cutting off of its tainted member for the preservation of society, as at present, into completely and honestly adopting the idea of the regeneration of the man, of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reformation and salvation?''
<p/>'' What do you mean? I fail to understand again,'' Miüsov interrupted. '' Some sort of dream again. Something shapeless and even incomprehensible.
<p/>Yes, but you know, in reality it is so now,'' said the elder suddenly, and all turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at once.
<p/>If it were not for the Church of Christ there would be nothing to restrain the criminal from evil-doing, no real chastisement for it afterwards; none, that is, but the mechanical punishment spoken of just now, which in the majority of cases only embitters the heart; and not the real punishment, the only effectual one, the only deterrent and softening one, which lies in the recognition of sin by conscience.
<p/>What is excommunication? What sort of exclusion? I suspect you are simply amusing yourself, Ivan Fyodorovitch.'' '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``How is that, may one inquire?
<p/>Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>began the elder, <div class="bookquote">``all these sentences to exile with hard labor, and formerly with flogging also, reform no one, and what's more, deter hardly a single criminal, and the number of crimes does not diminish but is continually on the increase.
<p/>Consequently the security of society is not preserved, for, although the obnoxious member is mechanically cut off and sent far away out of sight, another criminal always comes to take his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) place at once, and often two of them.
<p/>If anything does preserve society, even in our time, and does regenerate and transform the criminal, it is only the law of Christ speaking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) conscience.
<p/>It is only by recognizing his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) wrong-doing as a son of a Christian society--that is, of the Church--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) recognizes his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) sin against society--that is, against the Church.
<p/>So that it is only against the Church, and not against the State, that the criminal of to-day can recognize that he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) has sinned.
<p/>If society, as a Church, had jurisdiction, then it would know when to bring back from exclusion and to reunite to itself.
<p/>Now the Church having no real jurisdiction, but only the power of moral condemnation, withdraws of her (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) own accord from punishing the criminal actively.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miüsov/Pyotr Alexandrovitch/Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov</b></font>)</div>asked Miüsov, with lively curiosity. '' You must admit that. She (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) does not excommunicate him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) but simply persists in motherly exhortation of him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) admits him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) to church services, to the holy sacrament, gives him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) alms, and treats him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) more as a captive than as a convict.
<p/>And what would become of the criminal, O Lord, if even the Christian society--that is, the Church--were to reject him (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) even as the civil law rejects him (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) and cuts him (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) off?
<p/>What would become of him (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) if the Church punished him (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) excommunication as the direct consequence of the secular law?
<p/>What is more, the Church even tries to preserve all Christian communion with the criminal. There could be no more terrible despair, at least for a Russian criminal, for Russian criminals still have faith.
<p/>Though, who knows, perhaps then a fearful thing would happen, perhaps the despairing heart of the criminal would lose its faith and then what would become of him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>)?
<p/>But the Church, like a tender, loving mother, holds aloof from active punishment herself, as the sinner is too severely punished already by the civil law, and there must be at least some one to have pity on him (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>).
<p/>The Church holds aloof, above all, because its judgment is the only one that contains the truth, and therefore cannot practically and morally be united to any other judgment even as a temporary compromise.
<p/>The foreign criminal, they say, rarely repents, for the very doctrines of to-day confirm him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) in the idea that his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) crime is not a crime, but only a reaction against an unjustly oppressive force.
<p/>Society cuts him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) off completely by a force that triumphs over him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) mechanically and -LRB-so at least they say of themselves in Europe-RRB- accompanies this exclusion with hatred, forgetfulness, and the most profound indifference as to the ultimate fate of the erring brother.
<p/>In this way, it all takes place without the compassionate intervention of the Church, for in many cases there are no churches there at all, for though ecclesiastics and splendid church buildings remain
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) can enter into no compact about that. , the churches themselves have long ago striven to pass from Church into State and to disappear in it completely.
<p/>So it seems at least in Lutheran countries. As for Rome, it was proclaimed a State instead of a Church a thousand years ago.
<p/>And so the criminal is no longer conscious of being a member of the Church and sinks into despair. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) returns to society, often it is with such hatred that society itself instinctively cuts him (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) off.
<p/>In many cases it would seem to be the same with us, but the difference is that besides the established law courts we have the Church too, which always keeps up relations with the criminal as a dear and still precious son.
<p/>And besides that, there is still preserved, though only in thought, the judgment of the Church, which though no longer existing in practice is still living as a dream for the future, and is, no doubt, instinctively recognized by the criminal in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) soul.
<p/>What was said here just now is true too, that is, that if the jurisdiction of the Church were introduced in practice in its full force, that is, if the whole of the society were changed into the Church, not only the judgment of the Church would have influence on the reformation of the criminal such as it never has now, but possibly also the crimes themselves would be incredibly diminished.
<p/>And there can be no doubt that the Church would look upon the criminal and the crime of the future in many cases quite differently and would succeed in restoring the excluded, in restraining those who plan evil, and in regenerating the fallen.
<p/>It is true,'' said Father Zossima, with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``the Christian society now is not ready and is only resting on some seven righteous men, but as they are never lacking, it will continue still unshaken in expectation of its complete transformation from a society almost heathen in character into a single universal and all-powerful Church.
<p/>You can judge for yourself how it must end. So be it, so be it! Even though at the end of the ages, for it is ordained to come to pass!
<p/>And there is no need to be troubled about times and seasons, for the secret of the times and seasons is in the wisdom of God, in His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) foresight, and His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) love.
<p/>And what in human reckoning seems still afar off, may by the Divine ordinance be close at hand, on the eve of its appearance.
<p/>And so be it, so be it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Zossima/Father Zossima/Father</b></font>)</div>'' So be it, so be it!'' Father Paďssy repeated austerely and reverently. ''
<p/>Strange, extremely strange!'' Miüsov pronounced, not so much with heat as with latent indignation. '' What strikes you as so strange?
<p/>'' cried Miüsov, suddenly breaking out; <div class="bookquote">``the State is eliminated and the Church is raised to the position of the State.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miüsov/Pyotr Alexandrovitch/Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov</b></font>)</div>Father Iosif inquired cautiously. '' Why, it's beyond anything! It's not simply Ultramontanism, it's arch-Ultramontanism! It's beyond the dreams of Pope Gregory the Seventh!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are completely misunderstanding it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>said Father Paďssy sternly. '' Understand, the Church is not to be transformed into the State.
<p/>On the contrary, the State is transformed into the Church, will ascend and become a Church over the whole world--which is the complete opposite of Ultramontanism and Rome, and your interpretation, and is only the glorious destiny ordained for the Orthodox Church.
<p/>That is Rome and its dream. That is the third temptation of the devil. This star will arise in the east!''
<p/>Miüsov was significantly silent. His (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) whole figure expressed extraordinary personal dignity. A supercilious and condescending smile played on his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) lips. Alyosha watched it all with a throbbing heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) glanced casually at Rakitin, who was standing immovable in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) place by the door listening and watching intently though with downcast eyes.
<p/>But from the color in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) cheeks Alyosha guessed that Rakitin was probably no less excited, and he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) knew what caused his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) excitement.
<p/>The whole conversation stirred him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) profoundly. <div class="bookquote">``Allow me to tell you one little anecdote, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miüsov/Pyotr Alexandrovitch/Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov</b></font>)</div>Miüsov said impressively, with a peculiarly majestic air.
<p/>Some years ago, soon after the coup d'état of December, I happened to be calling in Paris on an extremely influential personage in the Government, and I met a very interesting man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house.
<p/>This individual was not precisely a detective but was a sort of superintendent of a whole regiment of political detectives--a rather powerful position in its own way.
<p/>And as he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) had not come as a visitor but as a subordinate official bringing a special report, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) saw the reception given me by his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) chief, he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) deigned to speak with some openness, to a certain extent only, of course.
<p/>'' I was prompted by curiosity to seize the opportunity of conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) was rather courteous than open, as Frenchmen know how to be courteous, especially to a foreigner.
<p/>But I thoroughly understood him (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>). The subject was the socialist revolutionaries who were at that time persecuted. I will quote only one most curious remark dropped by this person. '
<p/>We are not particularly afraid,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>), `of all these socialists, anarchists, infidels, and revolutionists; we keep watch on them and know all their goings on.
<p/>But there are a few peculiar men among them who believe in God and are Christians, but at the same time are socialists.
<p/>These are the people we are most afraid of. They are dreadful people! The socialist who is a Christian is more to be dreaded than a socialist who is an atheist.'
<p/>The words struck me at the time, and now they have suddenly come back to me here, gentlemen.'' <div class="bookquote">``You apply them to us, and look upon us as socialists?
<p/>But before Pyotr Alexandrovitch could think what to answer, the door opened, and the guest so long expected, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, came in.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>Father Paďssy asked directly, without beating about the bush. They had, in fact, given up expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) sudden appearance caused some surprise for a moment.
<p/>Chapter VI. Why Is Such A Man Alive? Dmitri Fyodorovitch, a young man of eight and twenty, of medium height and agreeable countenance, looked older than his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) years.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was muscular, and showed signs of considerable physical strength. Yet there was something not healthy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) face. It was rather thin, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) cheeks were hollow, and there was an unhealthy sallowness in their color.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) rather large, prominent, dark eyes had an expression of firm determination, and yet there was a vague look in them, too.
<p/>Even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was excited and talking irritably, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) eyes somehow did not follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) mood, but betrayed something else, sometimes quite incongruous with what was passing.
<p/>People who saw something pensive and sullen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) eyes were startled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) sudden laugh, which bore witness to mirthful and light- hearted thoughts at the very time when his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) eyes were so gloomy.
<p/>'' It's hard to tell what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'s thinking,'' those who talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) sometimes declared. A certain strained look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) face was easy to understand at this moment.
<p/>Every one knew, or had heard of, the extremely restless and dissipated life which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had been leading of late, as well as of the violent anger to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had been roused in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) quarrels with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) father.
<p/>It is true that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was irascible by nature, <div class="bookquote">``of an unstable and unbalanced mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as our justice of the peace, Katchalnikov, happily described him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>).
<p/>There were several stories current in the town about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was stylishly and irreproachably dressed in a carefully buttoned frock- coat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) wore black gloves and carried a top-hat. Having only lately left the army, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) still had mustaches and no beard.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) dark brown hair was cropped short, and combed forward on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) temples. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had the long, determined stride of a military man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) stood still for a moment on the threshold, and glancing at the whole party went straight up to the elder, guessing him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) to be their host.
<p/>Dmitri kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) hand respectfully, and with intense feeling, almost anger, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Be so generous as to forgive me for having kept you waiting so long, but Smerdyakov, the valet sent me by my father, in reply to my inquiries, told me twice over that the appointment was for one.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a low bow, and asked his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) blessing. Father Zossima, rising in his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) chair, blessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>). Now I suddenly learn--''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't disturb yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>interposed the elder. '' No matter. You are a little late. It's of no consequence...'' <div class="bookquote">``I'm extremely obliged to you, and expected no less from your goodness.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dmitri/Dmitri Fyodorovitch/Dmitri Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Saying this, Dmitri bowed once more. Then, turning suddenly towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) father, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), too, a similarly low and respectful bow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had evidently considered it beforehand, and made this bow in all seriousness, thinking it his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) duty to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) respect and good intentions.
<p/>In response to Dmitri's bow he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) jumped up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) chair and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) son a bow as low in return.
<p/>Although Fyodor Pavlovitch was taken unawares, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was equal to the occasion. His (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) face was suddenly solemn and impressive, which gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) a positively malignant look.
<p/>Dmitri bowed generally to all present, and without a word walked to the window with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) long, resolute stride, sat down on the only empty chair, near Father Paďssy, and, bending forward, prepared to listen to the conversation he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had interrupted.
<p/>Dmitri's entrance had taken no more than two minutes, and the conversation was resumed. But this time Miüsov thought it unnecessary to reply to Father Paďssy's persistent and almost irritable question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Allow me to withdraw from this discussion,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) observed with a certain well-bred nonchalance. '' It's a subtle question, too. Here Ivan Fyodorovitch is smiling at us.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) must have something interesting to say about that also. Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>).'' '' Nothing special, except one little remark,'' Ivan replied at once.
<p/>European Liberals in general, and even our liberal dilettanti, often mix up the final results of socialism with those of Christianity.
<p/>But it's not only Liberals and dilettanti who mix up socialism and Christianity, but, in many cases, it appears, the police--the foreign police, of course--do the same.
<p/>'' This wild notion is, of course, a characteristic feature. Your Paris anecdote is rather to the point, Pyotr Alexandrovitch. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I ask your permission to drop this subject altogether,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Miüsov repeated. '' I will tell you instead, gentlemen, another interesting and rather characteristic anecdote of Ivan Fyodorovitch himself.
<p/>Only five days ago, in a gathering here, principally of ladies, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) solemnly declared in argument that there was nothing in the whole world to make men love their neighbors.
<p/>That there was no law of nature that man should love mankind, and that, if there had been any love on earth hitherto, it was not owing to a natural law, but simply because men have believed in immortality.
<p/>Ivan Fyodorovitch added in parenthesis that the whole natural law lies in that faith, and that if you were to destroy in mankind the belief in immortality, not only love but every living force maintaining the life of the world would at once be dried up.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) ended by asserting that for every individual, like ourselves, who does not believe in God or immortality, the moral law of nature must immediately be changed into the exact contrary of the former religious law, and that egoism, even to crime, must become not only lawful but even recognized as the inevitable, the most rational, even honorable outcome of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) position.
<p/>Moreover, nothing then would be immoral, everything would be lawful, even cannibalism. That's not all. From this paradox, gentlemen, you can judge of the rest of our eccentric and paradoxical friend Ivan Fyodorovitch's theories.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dmitri/Dmitri Fyodorovitch/Dmitri Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Dmitri cried suddenly; <div class="bookquote">``if I've heard aright, crime must not only be permitted but even recognized as the inevitable and the most rational outcome of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) position for every infidel!
<p/>Is that so or not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dmitri/Dmitri Fyodorovitch/Dmitri Karamazov</b></font>)</div>'' Quite so,'' said Father Paďssy. '' I'll remember it. '' Having uttered these words Dmitri ceased speaking as suddenly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had begun.
<p/>Is that really your conviction as to the consequences of the disappearance of the faith in immortality?'' the elder asked Ivan suddenly.
<p/>Every one looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) with curiosity. '' '' Yes. That was my contention. There is no virtue if there is no immortality.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Because, in all probability you don't believe yourself in the immortality of your soul, nor in what you have written yourself in your article on Church jurisdiction.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are blessed in believing that, or else most unhappy.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why unhappy? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan asked smiling. '' <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you are right! ...
<p/>But I wasn't altogether joking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan suddenly and strangely confessed, flushing quickly. '' You were not altogether joking. That's true. The question is still fretting your heart, and not answered.
<p/>Meanwhile, in your despair, you, too, divert yourself with magazine articles, and discussions in society, though you don't believe your own arguments, and with an aching heart mock at them inwardly....
<p/>But the martyr likes sometimes to divert himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) despair, as it were driven to it by despair itself. That question you have not answered, and it is your great grief, for it clamors for an answer.''
<p/>'' But can it be answered by me? Answered in the affirmative? '' Ivan went on asking strangely, still looking at the elder with the same inexplicable smile.
<p/>'' If it can't be decided in the affirmative, it will never be decided in the negative. You know that that is the peculiarity of your heart, and all its suffering is due to it.
<p/>But thank the Creator who has given you a lofty heart capable of such suffering; of thinking and seeking higher things, for our dwelling is in the heavens.
<p/>God grant that your heart will attain the answer on earth, and may God bless your path. '' The elder raised his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand and would have made the sign of the cross over Ivan from where he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) stood.
<p/>But the latter rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) seat, went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), received his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) blessing, and kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hand went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) place in silence.
<p/>This action and all the preceding conversation, which was so surprising from Ivan, impressed every one by its strangeness and a certain solemnity, so that all were silent for a moment, and there was a look almost of apprehension in Alyosha's face.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face looked firm and earnest. But Miüsov suddenly shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) shoulders. And at the same moment Fyodor Pavlovitch jumped up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) seat.
<p/>Most pious and holy elder,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) cried, pointing to Ivan, ``that is my son, flesh of my flesh, the dearest of my flesh!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is my most dutiful Karl Moor, so to speak, while this son who has just come in, Dmitri, against whom I am seeking justice from you, is the undutiful Franz Moor--they are both out of Schiller's Robbers , and so I am the reigning Count von Moor!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak without buffoonery, and don't begin by insulting the members of your family,''  (<font color='red'><b>Judge</b></font>)</div>answered the elder, in a faint, exhausted voice.
<p/>'' Judge and save us! We need not only your prayers but your prophecies!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) was obviously getting more and more fatigued, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) strength was failing.
<p/>'' An unseemly farce which I foresaw when I came here!'' cried Dmitri indignantly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) too leapt up. '' Forgive it, reverend Father,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) added, addressing the elder.
<p/>I am not a cultivated man, and I don't even know how to address you properly, but you have been deceived and you have been too good-natured in letting us meet here.
<p/>'' All my father wants is a scandal. Why he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wants it only he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can tell. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always has some motive.
<p/>But I believe I know why--'' <div class="bookquote">``They all blame me, all of them! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried Fyodor Pavlovitch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) turn. ''
<p/>Pyotr Alexandrovitch here blames me too. You have been blaming me, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, you have! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) turned suddenly to Miüsov, although the latter was not dreaming of interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>).
<p/>They all accuse me of having hidden the children's money in my boots, and cheated them, but isn't there a court of law?
<p/>There they will reckon out for you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, from your notes, your letters, and your agreements, how much money you had, how much you have spent, and how much you have left.
<p/>Because they are all against me, while Dmitri Fyodorovitch is in debt to me, and not a little, but some thousands of which I have documentary proof.
<p/>'' Why does Pyotr Alexandrovitch refuse to pass judgment? Dmitri is not a stranger to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>). The whole town is echoing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) debaucheries.
<p/>And where he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was stationed before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) several times spent a thousand or two for the seduction of some respectable girl; we know all about that, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, in its most secret details.
<p/>Would you believe it, holy Father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) has captivated the heart of the most honorable of young ladies of good family and fortune, daughter of a gallant colonel, formerly his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) superior officer, who had received many honors and had the Anna Order on his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) breast.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) compromised the girl by his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) promise of marriage, now she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is an orphan and here; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is betrothed to him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>), yet before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) very eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) is dancing attendance on a certain enchantress.
<p/>And although this enchantress has lived in, so to speak, civil marriage with a respectable man, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is of an independent character, an unapproachable fortress for everybody, just like a legal wife--
<p/>Dmitri Fyodorovitch wants to open this fortress with a golden key, and that's why he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is insolent to me now, trying to get money from me, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) has wasted thousands on this enchantress already.
<p/>I'll prove it.... for she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is virtuous, yes, holy Fathers, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is virtuous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'s continually borrowing money for the purpose. From whom do you think?
<p/>Shall I say, Mitya?'' <div class="bookquote">``Be silent! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dmitri/Dmitri Fyodorovitch/Dmitri Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Dmitri, <div class="bookquote">``wait till I'm gone. Don't dare in my presence to asperse the good name of an honorable girl!
<p/>That you should utter a word about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is an outrage, and I won't permit it! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dmitri/Dmitri Fyodorovitch/Dmitri Karamazov</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was breathless. <div class="bookquote">``Mitya!
<p/>Mitya! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div>cried Fyodor Pavlovitch hysterically, squeezing out a tear. '' And is your father's blessing nothing to you? If I curse you, what then?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shameless hypocrite! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dmitri/Dmitri Fyodorovitch/Dmitri Karamazov</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Dmitri furiously. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) says that to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) father! his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) father! What would he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) be with others?
<p/>Gentlemen, only fancy; there's a poor but honorable man living here, burdened with a numerous family, a captain who got into trouble and was discharged from the army, but not publicly, not by court-martial, with no slur on his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) honor.
<p/>And three weeks ago, Dmitri seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) by the beard in a tavern, dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) out into the street and beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) publicly, and all because he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) is an agent in a little business of mine.''
<p/>'' It's all a lie! Outwardly it's the truth, but inwardly a lie! '' Dmitri was trembling with rage. '' Father, I don't justify my action.
<p/>, I behaved like a brute to that captain, and I regret it now, and I'm disgusted with myself for my brutal rage.
<p/>But this captain, this agent of yours, went to that lady whom you call an enchantress, and suggested to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) from you, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should take I.O.U.'s of mine which were in your possession, and should sue me for the money so as to get me into prison by means of them, if I persisted in claiming an account from you of my property.
<p/>Yes, I confess it publicly Now you reproach me for having a weakness for that lady when you yourself incited her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to captivate me!
<p/>You wanted to put me in prison because you are jealous of me with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), because you'd begun to force your attentions upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); and I know all about that, too; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) laughed at you for that as well--you hear--
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told me so to my face.... She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) told me the story and laughed at you.... she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) laughed at you as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) described it.
<p/>Gentlemen, forgive my anger, but I foresaw that this crafty old man would only bring you together to create a scandal.
<p/>So here you have this man, this father who reproaches his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) profligate son! I had come to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand; to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and ask forgiveness!
<p/>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has just this minute insulted not only me, but an honorable young lady, for whom I feel such reverence that I dare not take her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name in vain, I have made up my mind to show up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) game, though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is my father...
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not go on. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes were glittering and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) breathed with difficulty. But every one in the cell was stirred.
<p/>All except Father Zossima got up from their seats uneasily. The monks looked austere but waited for guidance from the elder.
<p/>An imploring smile lighted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) face; from time to time he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) hand, as though to check the storm, and, of course, a gesture from him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) would have been enough to end the scene; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) seemed to be waiting for something and watched them intently as though trying to make out something which was not perfectly clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) sat still, pale, not from excitement but from the weakness of disease. At last Miüsov felt completely humiliated and disgraced.
<p/>'' We are all to blame for this scandalous scene,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) said hotly. '' But I did not foresee it when I came, though I knew with whom I had to deal.
<p/>Believe me, your reverence, I had no precise knowledge of the details that have just come to light, I was unwilling to believe them, and I learn for the first time....
<p/>A father is jealous of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son's relations with a woman of loose behavior and intrigues with the creature to get his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son into prison!
<p/>This must be stopped at once! This is the company in which I have been forced to be present! I was deceived.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dmitri Fyodorovitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div>yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, in an unnatural voice, <div class="bookquote">``if you were not my son I would challenge you this instant to a duel ... with pistols, at three paces ... across a handkerchief,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) ended, stamping with both feet.
<p/>With old liars who have been acting all their lives there are moments when they enter so completely into their part that they tremble or shed tears of emotion in earnest, although at that very moment, or a second later, they are able to whisper to themselves, <div class="bookquote">``You know you are lying, you shameless old sinner!
<p/>I declare to you all that I was as much deceived as any one.''  (<font color='red'><b>liars</b></font>)</div>You're acting now, in spite of your `holy' wrath.
<p/>I thought,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) said, in a soft and, as it were, controlled voice, <div class="bookquote">``that I was coming to my native place with the angel of my heart, my betrothed, to cherish his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) old age, and I find nothing but a depraved profligate, a despicable clown!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Dmitri frowned painfully, and looked with unutterable contempt at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) father. '' I thought ... <div class="bookquote">``A duel! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>yelled the old wretch again, breathless and spluttering at each syllable.
<p/>And you, Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov, let me tell you that there has never been in all your family a loftier, and more honest--you hear--more honest woman than this `creature,' as you have dared to call her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!
<p/>And you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, have abandoned your betrothed for that `creature,' so you must yourself have thought that your betrothed couldn't hold a candle to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>'' That's the woman called a `creature'!'' <div class="bookquote">``Shameful! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>broke from Father Iosif. '' Shameful and disgraceful!'' Kalganov, flushing crimson, cried in a boyish voice, trembling with emotion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had been silent till that moment. '' Why is such a man alive? '' Dmitri, beside himself with rage, growled in a hollow voice, hunching up his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) shoulders till he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) looked almost deformed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, can he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) be allowed to go on defiling the earth?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) looked round at every one and pointed at the old man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) spoke evenly and deliberately. '' Listen, listen, monks, to the parricide! '' cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, rushing up to Father Iosif.
<p/>'' That's the answer to your `shameful!' What is shameful? That `creature,' that `woman of loose behavior' is perhaps holier than you are yourselves,
<p/>you monks who are seeking salvation! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fell perhaps in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) youth, ruined by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) environment. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loved much, and Christ himself forgave the woman `who loved much.'
<p/>'' '' It was not for such love Christ forgave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),'' broke impatiently from the gentle Father Iosif. '' Yes, it was for such, monks, it was!
<p/>You save your souls here, eating cabbage, and think you are the righteous. You eat a gudgeon a day, and you think you bribe God with gudgeon.
<p/>'' '' This is unendurable!'' was heard on all sides in the cell. But this unseemly scene was cut short in a most unexpected way.
<p/>Father Zossima rose suddenly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) seat. Almost distracted with anxiety for the elder and every one else, Alyosha succeeded, however, in supporting him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) by the arm.
<p/>Father Zossima moved towards Dmitri and reaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) sank on his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) knees before him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>). Alyosha thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) had fallen from weakness, but this was not so.
<p/>The elder distinctly and deliberately bowed down at Dmitri's feet till his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) forehead touched the floor. Alyosha was so astounded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) failed to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) got up again.
<p/>There was a faint smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) lips. '' Good-by! Forgive me, all of you!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) said, bowing on all sides to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) guests.
<p/>Dmitri stood for a few moments in amazement. Bowing down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)--what did it mean? Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) cried aloud, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>hid his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands, and rushed out of the room.
<p/>All the guests flocked out after him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), in their confusion not saying good-by, or bowing to their host. Only the monks went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) again for a blessing.
<p/>Was it symbolic or what?'' said Fyodor Pavlovitch, suddenly quieted and trying to reopen conversation without venturing to address anybody in particular.
<p/>'' What did it mean, falling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) feet like that? They were all passing out of the precincts of the hermitage at the moment.
<p/>I can't answer for a madhouse and for madmen,'' Miüsov answered at once ill-humoredly, <div class="bookquote">``but I will spare myself your company, Fyodor Pavlovitch, and, trust me, for ever.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Superior</b></font>) met them as soon as they came down the steps from the elder's cell, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Superior</b></font>) had been waiting for them all the time.
<p/>Convey my deepest respect to the Father Superior, apologize for me, personally, Miüsov, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) reverence, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) that I deeply regret that owing to unforeseen circumstances I am unable to have the honor of being present at his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) table, greatly as I should desire to do so,'' Miüsov said irritably to the monk.
<p/>'' Reverend Father, kindly do me a favor. '' And that unforeseen circumstance, of course, is myself,'' Fyodor Pavlovitch cut in immediately.
<p/>'' Do you hear, Father; this gentleman doesn't want to remain in my company or else he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'d come at once. And you shall go, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, pray go to the Father Superior and good appetite to you.
<p/>I will decline, and not you. Home, home, I'll eat at home , I don't feel equal to it here, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, my amiable relative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Unfortunately I feel myself compelled to go to this confounded dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miüsov/Pyotr Alexandrovitch/Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov</b></font>)</div>said Miüsov with the same irritability, regardless of the fact that the monk was listening.

<p/>On the road through the copse he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) made one observation however--that the Father Superior had been waiting a long time, and that they were more than half an hour late.
<p/>Well, I should hope not! Confound this dinner! '' They all walked on, however. The monk listened in silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) received no answer.
<p/>Miüsov looked with hatred at Ivan. '' Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is, going to the dinner as though nothing had happened,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) thought.
<p/>'' A brazen face, and the conscience of a Karamazov!'' Chapter VII. A Young Man Bent On A Career Alyosha helped Father Zossima to his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) bedroom and seated him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) bed.
<p/>It was a little room furnished with the bare necessities. There was a narrow iron bedstead, with a strip of felt for a mattress.
<p/>In the corner, under the ikons, was a reading-desk with a cross and the Gospel lying on it. The elder sank exhausted on the bed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) eyes glittered and he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) breathed hard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) looked intently at Alyosha, as though considering something. '' Go, my dear boy, go.
<p/>Porfiry is enough for me. Make haste, you are needed there, go and wait at the Father Superior's table.'' <div class="bookquote">``Let me stay here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha entreated.
<p/>'' You are more needed there. There is no peace there. You will wait, and be of service. If evil spirits rise up, repeat a prayer.
<p/>And remember, my son''--the elder liked to call him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) that--<div class="bookquote">``this is not the place for you in the future. When it is God's will to call me, leave the monastery.
<p/>Go away for good. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Alyosha started. '' What is it? This is not your place for the time. I bless you for great service in the world.
<p/>Yours will be a long pilgrimage. And you will have to take a wife, too. You will have to bear all before you come back.
<p/>There will be much to do. But I don't doubt of you, and so I send you forth. Christ is with you.
<p/>Do not abandon Him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) and He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) will not abandon you. You will see great sorrow, and in that sorrow you will be happy.
<p/>This is my last message to you: in sorrow seek happiness. Work, work unceasingly. Remember my words, for although I shall talk with you again, not only my days
<p/>but my hours are numbered. '' Alyosha's face again betrayed strong emotion. The corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) mouth quivered. '' What is it again?
<p/>'' Father Zossima asked, smiling gently. '' The worldly may follow the dead with tears, but here we rejoice over the father who is departing.
<p/>We rejoice and pray for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Leave me, I must pray. Go, and make haste. Be near your brothers. And not near one only, but near both.
<p/>'' Father Zossima raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) hand to bless him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>). Alyosha could make no protest, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) had a great longing to remain.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) longed, moreover, to ask the significance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) bowing to Dmitri, the question was on the tip of his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) tongue, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) dared not ask it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) knew that the elder would have explained it unasked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) had thought fit. But evidently it was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) will.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) hastened out of the hermitage precincts to reach the monastery in time to serve at the Father Superior's dinner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) felt a sudden pang at his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) heart, and stopped short.
<p/>That action had made a terrible impression on Alyosha; he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) believed blindly in its mysterious significance. Mysterious, and perhaps awful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) seemed to hear again Father Zossima's words, foretelling his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) approaching end.
<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had foretold so exactly must infallibly come to pass. Alyosha believed that implicitly. But how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) be left without him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)?
<p/>How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) live without seeing and hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)? Where should he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) go? He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) not to weep, and to leave the monastery.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hurried through the copse that divided the monastery from the hermitage, and unable to bear the burden of his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) thoughts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) gazed at the ancient pines beside the path.
<p/>Good God! It was long since Alyosha had known such anguish. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had not far to go--about five hundred paces. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) expected to meet no one at that hour, but at the first turn of the path he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) noticed Rakitin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was waiting for some one. '' Are you waiting for me? '' asked Alyosha, overtaking him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). '' Yes,'' grinned Rakitin.
<p/>'' You are hurrying to the Father Superior, I know; he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) has a banquet. There's not been such a banquet since the Superior entertained the Bishop and General Pahatov, do you remember?
<p/>I shan't be there, but you go and hand the sauces. Tell me one thing, Alexey, what does that vision mean?
<p/>That's what I want to ask you.'' <div class="bookquote">``What vision?''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>'' That bowing to your brother, Dmitri. And didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) tap the ground with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) forehead, too!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You speak of Father Zossima?''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, of Father Zossima.'' <div class="bookquote">``Tapped the ground?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, an irreverent expression! Well, what of it?
<p/>Anyway, what does that vision mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what it means, Misha.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) wouldn't explain it to you!
<p/>All the pious people in the town will talk about it and spread the story through the province, wondering what it meant.
<p/>There's nothing wonderful about it, of course, only the usual holy mummery. But there was an object in the performance. To my thinking the old man really has a keen nose; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sniffed a crime.
<p/>Your house stinks of it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What crime? '' Rakitin evidently had something he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was eager to speak of. ''
<p/>It'll be in your family, this crime. Between your brothers and your rich old father. So Father Zossima flopped down to be ready for what may turn up.
<p/>If something happens later on, it'll be: `Ah, the holy man foresaw it, prophesied it!' though it's a poor sort of prophecy, flopping like that. '
<p/>Ah, but it was symbolic,' they'll say, `an allegory,' and the devil knows what all! It'll be remembered to his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) glory: '
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) predicted the crime and marked the criminal!' That's always the way with these crazy fanatics; they cross themselves at the tavern and throw stones at the temple.
<p/>Like your elder, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) takes a stick to a just man and falls at the feet of a murderer. '' ''
<p/>What crime? What murderer? What do you mean? '' Alyosha stopped dead. Rakitin stopped, too. '' What murderer? As though you didn't know!
<p/>I'll bet you've thought of it before. That's interesting, too, by the way. Listen, Alyosha, you always speak the truth, though you're always between two stools.
<p/>Have you thought of it or not? Answer. '' <div class="bookquote">``I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>answered Alyosha in a low voice. Even Rakitin was taken aback.
<p/>'' What? Have you really? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) cried. '' I ... I've not exactly thought it,'' muttered Alyosha, <div class="bookquote">``but directly you began speaking so strangely
<p/>, I fancied I had thought of it myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You see? -LRB-And how well you expressed it!-RRB- Looking at your father and your brother Mitya to-day you thought of a crime.
<p/>Then I'm not mistaken?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>'' But wait, wait a minute,'' Alyosha broke in uneasily. '' What has led you to see all this?
<p/>Why does it interest you? That's the first question.'' <div class="bookquote">``Two questions, disconnected, but natural. I'll deal with them separately. What led me to see it?
<p/>I shouldn't have seen it, if I hadn't suddenly understood your brother Dmitri, seen right into the very heart of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) all at once.
<p/>I caught the whole man from one trait. These very honest but passionate people have a line which mustn't be crossed.
<p/>But your father's a drunken and abandoned old sinner, who can never draw the line--if they both let themselves go, they'll both come to grief.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>If it were, he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>)'d run at your father with a knife. <div class="bookquote">``No, Misha, no. If that's all, you've reassured me. It won't come to that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But why are you trembling? Let me tell you; he (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) may be honest, our Mitya -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is stupid, but honest-RRB-, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s--a sensualist.
<p/>That's the very definition and inner essence of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). It's your father has handed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) low sensuality. Do you know, I simply wonder at you,
<p/>Alyosha, how you can have kept your purity. You're a Karamazov too, you know! In your family sensuality is carried to a disease.
<p/>But now, these three sensualists are watching one another, with their knives in their belts. The three of them are knocking their heads together, and you may be the fourth.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mistaken about that woman. Dmitri--despises her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha, with a sort of shudder. '' Grushenka? No, brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) doesn't despise her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Since he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has openly abandoned his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) betrothed for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) doesn't despise her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). There's something here, my dear boy, that you don't understand yet.
<p/>A man will fall in love with some beauty, with a woman's body, or even with a part of a woman's body -LRB-a sensualist can understand that-RRB-, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll abandon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own children for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), sell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father and mother, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) country, Russia, too.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s honest, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll steal; if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s humane, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll murder; if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s faithful, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll deceive. Pushkin, the poet of women's feet, sung of their feet in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) verse.
<p/>Others don't sing their praises, but they can't look at their feet without a thrill--and it's not only their feet. Contempt's no help here, brother, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did despise Grushenka.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) does, but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) can't tear himself away.'' <div class="bookquote">``I understand that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha jerked out suddenly. '' Really? Well, I dare say you do understand, since you blurt it out at the first word,'' said Rakitin, malignantly.
<p/>'' That escaped you unawares, and the confession's the more precious. So it's a familiar subject; you've thought about it already, about sensuality, I mean!
<p/>You're a quiet one, Alyosha, you're a saint, I know, but the devil only knows what you've thought about, and what you know already!
<p/>Oh, you virgin soul! You are pure, but you've been down into the depths.... I've been watching you a long time.
<p/>You're a Karamazov yourself; you're a thorough Karamazov--no doubt birth and selection have something to answer for. You're a sensualist from your father, a crazy saint from your mother.
<p/>Why do you tremble? Is it true, then? Do you know, Grushenka has been begging me to bring you along. '
<p/>I'll pull off his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) cassock,' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says. You can't think how she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) keeps begging me to bring you. I wondered why she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) took such an interest in you.
<p/>Do you know, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s an extraordinary woman, too!'' <div class="bookquote">``Thank her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and say I'm not coming,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha, with a strained smile.
<p/>'' Finish what you were saying, Misha. I'll tell you my idea after.'' '' There's nothing to finish. It's all clear.
<p/>It's the same old tune, brother. If even you are a sensualist at heart, what of your brother, Ivan? He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s a Karamazov, too.
<p/>Your brother Ivan writes theological articles in joke, for some idiotic, unknown motive of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) own, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s an atheist, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) admits it's a fraud himself--that's your brother Ivan.
<p/>What is at the root of all you Karamazovs is that you're all sensual, grasping and crazy! He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s trying to get Mitya's betrothed for himself, and I fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'ll succeed, too.
<p/>And what's more, it's with Mitya's consent. For Mitya will surrender his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) betrothed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to be rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>), and escape to Grushenka.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s ready to do that in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) nobility and disinterestedness. Observe that. Those are the most fatal people!
<p/>Who the devil can make you out? He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) recognizes his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) vileness and goes on with it! Let me tell you, too, the old man, your father, is standing in Mitya's way now.
<p/>It's simply on her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) account he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) made that scene in the cell just now, simply because Miüsov called her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) an `abandoned creature.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) has suddenly gone crazy over Grushenka. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mouth waters at the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s worse than a tom-cat in love.
<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) was only employed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) in connection with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) taverns and in some other shady business, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) has suddenly realized all she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) is and has gone wild about her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) keeps pestering her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) offers, not honorable ones, of course. And they'll come into collision, the precious father and son, on that path!
<p/>But Grushenka favors neither of them, she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)'s still playing with them, and teasing them both, considering which she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) can get most out of.
<p/>For though she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) could filch a lot of money from the papa he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) wouldn't marry her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>), and maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'ll turn stingy in the end, and keep his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) purse shut.
<p/>That's where Mitya's value comes in; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) has no money, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s ready to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>). Yes, ready to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)!
<p/>to abandon his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) betrothed, a rare beauty, Katerina Ivanovna, who's rich, and the daughter of a colonel, and to marry Grushenka, who has been the mistress of a dissolute old merchant, Samsonov, a coarse, uneducated, provincial mayor.
<p/>Some murderous conflict may well come to pass from all this, and that's what your brother Ivan is waiting for. It would suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) down to the ground.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'ll carry off Katerina Ivanovna, for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is languishing, and pocket her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) dowry of sixty thousand. That's very alluring to start with, for a man of no consequence and a beggar.
<p/>For I know as a fact that Mitya only last week, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was with some gypsy girls drunk in a tavern, cried out aloud that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was unworthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) betrothed, Katya, but that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) brother Ivan, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was the man who deserved her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>).
<p/>And, take note, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) won't be wronging Mitya, but doing him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) the greatest service. And Katerina Ivanovna will not in the end refuse such a fascinating man as Ivan.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'s hesitating between the two of them already. And how has that Ivan won you all, so that you all worship him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is laughing at you, and enjoying himself at your expense. '' <div class="bookquote">``How do you know? How can you speak so confidently?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/>Alyosha asked sharply, frowning. '' Why do you ask, and are frightened at my answer? It shows that you know I'm speaking the truth.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face changed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) lips twitched. '' And the problem's a stupid one. It is no good guessing it. Rack your brains--you'll understand it.
<p/>And did you hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) stupid theory just now: if there's no immortality of the soul, then there's no virtue, and everything is lawful.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) article is absurd and ridiculous. -LRB-And by the way, do you remember how your brother Mitya cried out: 'I will remember!'-RRB-
<p/>An attractive theory for scoundrels!---LRB-I'm being abusive , that's stupid.-RRB- Not for scoundrels, but for pedantic poseurs , `haunted by profound, unsolved doubts.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s showing off, and what it all comes to is, `on the one hand we cannot but admit' and `on the other it must be confessed!'
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) whole theory is a fraud! Humanity will find in itself the power to live for virtue even without believing in immortality.
<p/>It will find it in love for freedom, for equality, for fraternity. '' Rakitin could hardly restrain himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) heat, but, suddenly, as though remembering something, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) stopped short.
<p/>'' Well, that's enough,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) said, with a still more crooked smile. '' Why are you laughing? Do you think I'm a vulgar fool?''

<p/>I guess from your warmth that you are not indifferent to Katerina Ivanovna yourself; I've suspected that for a long time, brother, that's why you don't like my brother Ivan.

<p/>You often go to see her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>), and you told me yourself you're not her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) lover. I never dreamed that you of all people had such contempt for her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)!

<p/>Well, here we are. You'd better go to the kitchen. Hullo! what's wrong, what is it? Are we late? They can't have finished dinner so soon!
<p/>Have the Karamazovs been making trouble again? No doubt they have. Here's your father and your brother Ivan after him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). They've broken out from the Father Superior's.
<p/>And look, Father Isidor's shouting out something after them from the steps. And your father's shouting and waving his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arms. I expect he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s swearing.
<p/>Bah, and there goes Miüsov driving away in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) carriage. You see, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s going. And there's old Maximov running!--there must have been a row.
<p/>There can't have been any dinner. Surely they've not been beating the Father Superior! Or have they, perhaps, been beaten? It would serve them right!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Rakitin/Mr. Rakitin</b></font>)</div>There was reason for Rakitin's exclamations. There had been a scandalous, an unprecedented scene. It had all come from the impulse of a moment.
<p/>The Scandalous Scene Miüsov, as a man of breeding and delicacy, could not but feel some inward qualms, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached the Father Superior's with Ivan: he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) felt ashamed of having lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) temper.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) ought to have disdained that despicable wretch, Fyodor Pavlovitch, too much to have been upset by him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) in Father Zossima's cell, and so to have forgotten himself.
<p/>And if they're decent people here -LRB-and the Father Superior, I understand, is a nobleman-RRB- why not be friendly and courteous with them?
<p/>I won't argue, I'll fall in with everything, I'll win them by politeness, and ... and ... show them that I've nothing to do with that Ćsop, that buffoon, that Pierrot, and have merely been taken in over this affair, just as they have.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) determined to drop his (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) litigation with the monastery, and relinquish his (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) claims to the wood-cutting and fishery rights at once.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) was the more ready to do this because the rights had become much less valuable, and he (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) had indeed the vaguest idea where the wood and river in question were.
<p/>These excellent intentions were strengthened when he (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) entered the Father Superior's dining-room, though, strictly speaking, it was not a dining- room,
<p/>Chapter VIII. '' The monks were not to blame, in any case,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) reflected, on the steps. '' '' for the Father Superior had only two rooms altogether; they were, however, much larger and more comfortable than Father Zossima's.
<p/>The furniture was of mahogany, covered with leather, in the old-fashioned style of 1820; the floor was not even stained, but everything was shining with cleanliness, and there were many choice flowers in the windows;
<p/>But there was no great luxury about the furnishing of these rooms either. the most sumptuous thing in the room at the moment was, of course, the beautifully decorated table.
<p/>The cloth was clean, the service shone; there were three kinds of well-baked bread, two bottles of wine, two of excellent mead, and a large glass jug of kvas--both the latter made in the monastery, and famous in the neighborhood.
<p/>Rakitin related afterwards that there were five dishes: fish-soup made of sterlets, served with little fish patties; then boiled fish served in a special way; then salmon cutlets, ice pudding and compote, and finally, blanc-mange.
<p/>Rakitin found out about all these good things, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) could not resist peeping into the kitchen, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) already had a footing.
<p/>There was no vodka. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) had a footing everywhere, and got information about everything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was of an uneasy and envious temper.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) would play a prominent part of some sort, but Alyosha, who was attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>), was distressed to see that his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) friend Rakitin was dishonorable, and quite unconscious of being so himself, considering, on the contrary, that because he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) would not steal money left on the table he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was a man of the highest integrity.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was well aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) own considerable abilities, and nervously exaggerated them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) self-conceit. Neither Alyosha nor any one else could have influenced him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) in that.
<p/>Rakitin, of course, was a person of too little consequence to be invited to the dinner, to which Father Iosif, Father Paďssy, and one other monk were the only inmates of the monastery invited.
<p/>They were already waiting when Miüsov, Kalganov, and Ivan arrived. The other guest, Maximov, stood a little aside, waiting also. The Father Superior stepped into the middle of the room to receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) guests.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was a tall, thin, but still vigorous old man, with black hair streaked with gray, and a long, grave, ascetic face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) bowed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) guests in silence. But this time they approached to receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) blessing. Miüsov even tried to kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hand, but the Father Superior drew it back in time to avoid the salute.
<p/>But Ivan and Kalganov went through the ceremony in the most simple-hearted and complete manner, kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hand as peasants do.
<p/>'' We must apologize most humbly, your reverence,'' began Miüsov, simpering affably, and speaking in a dignified and respectful tone. ''
<p/>Pardon us for having come alone without the gentleman you invited, Fyodor Pavlovitch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) felt obliged to decline the honor of your hospitality, and not without reason.
<p/>In the reverend Father Zossima's cell he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) was carried away by the unhappy dissension with his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) son, and let fall words which were quite out of keeping ... in fact, quite unseemly ...
<p/>And therefore, recognizing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) had been to blame, he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) felt sincere regret and shame, and begged me, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) son Ivan Fyodorovitch, to convey to you his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) apologies and regrets.
<p/>as''--he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) glanced at the monks--<div class="bookquote">``your reverence is, no doubt, already aware. In brief, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) hopes and desires to make amends later.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) uttered the last word of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) tirade, Miüsov completely recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) self-complacency, and all traces of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) former irritation disappeared.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) asks your blessing, and begs you to forget what has taken place. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the monks</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) fully and sincerely loved humanity again.
<p/>The Father Superior listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) with dignity, and, with a slight bend of the head, replied: <div class="bookquote">``I sincerely deplore his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) absence.
<p/>Perhaps at our table he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) might have learnt to like us, and we him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>). Pray be seated, gentlemen. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) stood before the holy image, and began to say grace, aloud.
<p/>All bent their heads reverently, and Maximov clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) hands before him (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>), with peculiar fervor. It was at this moment that Fyodor Pavlovitch played his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) last prank.
<p/>It must be noted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) really had meant to go home, and really had felt the impossibility of going to dine with the Father Superior as though nothing had happened, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) disgraceful behavior in the elder's cell.
<p/>Not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was so very much ashamed of himself--quite the contrary perhaps. But still he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) felt it would be unseemly to go to dinner.
<p/>Yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) creaking carriage had hardly been brought to the steps of the hotel, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had hardly got into it, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) suddenly stopped short.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) own words at the elder's: ``I always feel when I meet people that I am lower than all, and that they all take me for a buffoon; so I say let me play the buffoon, for you are, every one of you, stupider and lower than I.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) suddenly recalled how he (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) had once in the past been asked, <div class="bookquote">``Why do you hate so and so, so much?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) longed to revenge himself on every one for his (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) own unseemliness. And he (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) had answered them, with his (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) shameless impudence, <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) has done me no harm. But I played him (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) a dirty trick, and ever since I have hated him (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>). ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Remembering that now, he (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) smiled quietly and malignantly, hesitating for a moment. His (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) eyes gleamed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) lips positively quivered. ''
<p/>Well, since I have begun, I may as well go on,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) decided. His (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) predominant sensation at that moment might be expressed in the following words, <div class="bookquote">``Well, there is no rehabilitating myself now.
<p/>So let me shame them for all I am worth. I will show them I don't care what they think--that's all!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) told the coachman to wait, while with rapid steps he (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) returned to the monastery and straight to the Father Superior's.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had no clear idea what he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) would do, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) could not control himself, and that a touch might drive him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) to the utmost limits of obscenity, but only to obscenity, to nothing criminal, nothing for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) could be legally punished.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) appeared in the Father Superior's dining-room, at the moment when the prayer was over, and all were moving to the table.
<p/>Standing in the doorway, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) scanned the company, and laughing his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) prolonged, impudent, malicious chuckle, looked them all boldly in the face.
<p/>In the last resort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) could always restrain himself, and had marveled indeed at himself, on that score, sometimes. '' They thought I had gone, and here I am again,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) cried to the whole room.
<p/>For one moment every one stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) without a word; and at once every one felt that something revolting, grotesque, positively scandalous, was about to happen.
<p/>Miüsov passed immediately from the most benevolent frame of mind to the most savage. All the feelings that had subsided and died down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) heart revived instantly.
<p/>'' No! this I cannot endure! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) cried. '' I absolutely cannot! and ... I certainly cannot!'' The blood rushed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) head.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) positively stammered; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was beyond thinking of style, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hat. '' What is it he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) cannot?
<p/>'' cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) absolutely cannot and certainly cannot? Your reverence, am I to come in or not? Will you receive me as your guest?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div><p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I venture to beg you most earnestly to lay aside your dissensions, and to be united in love and family harmony--with prayer to the Lord at our humble table.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are welcome with all my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>answered the Superior. ``Gentlemen! <div class="bookquote">``No, no, it is impossible! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miüsov/Pyotr Alexandrovitch/Pyotr Alexandrovitch Miüsov</b></font>)</div>cried Miüsov, beside himself.
<p/>'' Well, if it is impossible for Pyotr Alexandrovitch, it is impossible for me, and I won't stop. That is why I came.
<p/>I will keep with Pyotr Alexandrovitch everywhere now. If you will go away, Pyotr Alexandrovitch, I will go away too, if you remain, I will remain.
<p/>You stung him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) by what you said about family harmony, Father Superior , he (<font color='blue'><b>Superior</b></font>) does not admit he (<font color='blue'><b>Superior</b></font>) is my relation.
<p/>That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Here's von Sohn. How are you, von Sohn?'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean me? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Maximov</b></font>)</div>muttered Maximov, puzzled.
<p/>'' Of course I mean you,'' cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. '' Who else? The Father Superior could not be von Sohn.'' ''
<p/>But I am not von Sohn either. I am Maximov. '' '' No, you are von Sohn. Your reverence, do you know who von Sohn was?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sohn</b></font>) was killed in a house of harlotry--I believe that is what such places are called among you--he (<font color='blue'><b>Sohn</b></font>) was killed and robbed, and in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sohn</b></font>) venerable age, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sohn</b></font>) was nailed up in a box and sent from Petersburg to Moscow in the luggage van, and while they were nailing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sohn</b></font>) up, the harlots sang songs and played the harp, that is to say, the piano.
<p/>It was a famous murder case. So this is that very von Sohn. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sohn</b></font>) has risen from the dead, hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Sohn</b></font>), von Sohn?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is happening? What's this? ''  (<font color='red'><b>monks</b></font>)</div>voices were heard in the group of monks. '' Let us go,'' cried Miüsov, addressing Kalganov.
<p/>'' No, excuse me,'' Fyodor Pavlovitch broke in shrilly, taking another step into the room. <div class="bookquote">``Allow me to finish. There in the cell you blamed me for behaving disrespectfully just because I spoke of eating gudgeon, Pyotr Alexandrovitch.
<p/>Miüsov, my relation, prefers to have plus de noblesse que de sincérité in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) words, but I prefer in mine plus de sincérité que de noblesse , and--
<p/>Allow me, Father Superior, though I am a buffoon and play the buffoon, yet I am the soul of honor, and I want to speak my mind.
<p/>damn the noblesse ! That's right, isn't it, von Sohn? Yes, I am the soul of honor, while in Pyotr Alexandrovitch there is wounded vanity and nothing else.
<p/>I came here perhaps to have a look and speak my mind. My son, Alexey, is here, being saved. I am his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) father; I care for his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) welfare, and it is my duty to care.
<p/>While I've been playing the fool, I have been listening and having a look on the sly; and now I want to give you the last act of the performance.
<p/>You know how things are with us? As a thing falls, so it lies. As a thing once has fallen, so it must lie for ever.
<p/>Confession is a great sacrament, before which I am ready to bow down reverently; but there in the cell, they all kneel down and confess aloud.
<p/>Not a bit of it! I want to get up again. Holy Father, I am indignant with you. Can it be right to confess aloud?
<p/>It was ordained by the holy Fathers to confess in secret: then only your confession will be a mystery, and so it was of old.
<p/>and that ... well, you understand what--sometimes it would not be proper to talk about it--so it is really a scandal!
<p/>No, Fathers, one might be carried along with you to the Flagellants, I dare say ... at the first opportunity I shall write to the Synod, and I shall take my son, Alexey, home.
<p/>But how can I explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) before every one that I did this ''  (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div>We must note here that Fyodor Pavlovitch knew where to look for the weak spot.
<p/>There had been at one time malicious rumors which had even reached the Archbishop -LRB-not only regarding our monastery, but in others where the institution of elders existed-RRB- that too much respect was paid to the elders, even to the detriment of the authority of the Superior, that the elders abused the sacrament of confession and so on and so on--absurd charges which had died away of themselves everywhere.
<p/>But the spirit of folly, which had caught up Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was bearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) on the current of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) own nerves into lower and lower depths of ignominy, prompted him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) with this old slander.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch did not understand a word of it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) could not even put it sensibly, for on this occasion no one had been kneeling and confessing aloud in the elder's cell, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) could not have seen anything of the kind.
<p/>But as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had uttered his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) foolish tirade, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had been talking absurd nonsense, and at once longed to prove to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) audience, and above all to himself, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had not been talking nonsense.
<p/>And, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) knew perfectly well that with each word he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) would be adding more and more absurdity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) could not restrain himself, and plunged forward blindly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was only speaking from confused memory of old slanders. '' How disgraceful!'' cried Pyotr Alexandrovitch. '' Pardon me! '' said the Father Superior.
<p/>And hearing it I have said to myself: it is the correction of the Lord and He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) has sent it to heal my vain soul.'
<p/>'' It was said of old, `Many have begun to speak against me and have uttered evil sayings about me. And so we humbly thank you, honored guest!''
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) made Fyodor Pavlovitch a low bow. '' Tut--tut--tut--sanctimoniousness and stock phrases! Old phrases and old gestures. The old lies and formal prostrations.
<p/>We know all about them. A kiss on the lips and a dagger in the heart, as in Schiller's Robbers .
<p/>I don't like falsehood, Fathers, I want the truth. But the truth is not to be found in eating gudgeon and that I proclaim aloud!
<p/>Father monks, why do you fast? Why do you expect reward in heaven for that? Why, for reward like that I will come and fast too!
<p/>No, saintly monk, you try being virtuous in the world, do good to society, without shutting yourself up in a monastery at other people's expense, and without expecting a reward up aloft for it--you'll find that a bit harder.
<p/>I can talk sense, too, Father Superior. What have they got here? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) went up to the table. '' Old port wine, mead brewed by the Eliseyev Brothers.
<p/>Fie, fie, fathers! That is something beyond gudgeon. Look at the bottles the fathers have brought out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)! And who has provided it all?
<p/>The Russian peasant, the laborer, brings here the farthing earned by his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) horny hand, wringing it from his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) family and the tax-gatherer!
<p/>You bleed the people, you know, holy fathers.'' '' This is too disgraceful!'' said Father Iosif. Father Paďssy kept obstinately silent.
<p/>Miüsov rushed from the room, and Kalganov after him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>). '' Well, Father, I will follow Pyotr Alexandrovitch! I am not coming to see you again.
<p/>You may beg me on your knees, I shan't come. I sent you a thousand roubles, so you have begun to keep your eye on me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)! No, I'll say no more. I am taking my revenge for my youth, for all the humiliation I endured.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) thumped the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) fist in a paroxysm of simulated feeling. '' This monastery has played a great part in my life!
<p/>It has cost me many bitter tears. You used to set my wife, the crazy one, against me. You cursed me with bell and book, you spread stories about me all over the place.
<p/>Enough, fathers! This is the age of Liberalism, the age of steamers and railways. Neither a thousand, nor a hundred roubles, no, nor a hundred farthings will you get out of me!
<p/>It must be noted again that our monastery never had played any great part in his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) life, and he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) never had shed a bitter tear owing to it.
<p/>'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was so carried away by his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) simulated emotion, that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was for one moment almost believing it himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was so touched he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was almost weeping. But at that very instant, he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) felt that it was time to draw back.
<p/>The Father Superior bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) head at his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) malicious lie, and again spoke impressively: <div class="bookquote">``It is written again, `Bear circumspectly and gladly dishonor that cometh upon thee by no act of thine own, be not confounded and hate not him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) who hath dishonored thee.'
<p/>And so will we.''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tut, tut, tut! Bethinking thyself and the rest of the rigmarole. Bethink yourselves, Fathers, I will go.
<p/>But I will take my son, Alexey, away from here for ever, on my parental authority. Ivan Fyodorovitch, my most dutiful son, permit me to order you to follow me.
<p/>Von Sohn, what have you to stay for? Come and see me now in the town. It is fun there. It is only one short verst; instead of lenten oil, I will give you sucking-pig and kasha.
<p/>We will have dinner with some brandy and liqueur to it.... I've cloudberry wine. Hey, von Sohn, don't lose your chance.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sohn</b></font>) went out, shouting and gesticulating. It was at that moment Rakitin saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) and pointed him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) out to Alyosha.
<p/>'' Alexey!'' his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) father shouted, from far off, catching sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>). '' You come home to me to-day, for good, and bring your pillow and mattress, and leave no trace behind.
<p/>Meanwhile, Fyodor Pavlovitch had got into the carriage, and Ivan was about to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) in grim silence without even turning to say good-by to Alyosha.
<p/>'' Alyosha stood rooted to the spot, watching the scene in silence. But at this point another almost incredible scene of grotesque buffoonery gave the finishing touch to the episode.
<p/>Maximov suddenly appeared by the side of the carriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) ran up, panting, afraid of being too late. Rakitin and Alyosha saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) running.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was in such a hurry that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) impatience he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) foot on the step on which Ivan's left foot was still resting, and clutching the carriage he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) kept trying to jump in.
<p/>'' I am going with you! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) kept shouting, laughing a thin mirthful laugh with a look of reckless glee in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take me, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There!''  (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div>cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, delighted. '' Did I not say he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was von Sohn. It is von Sohn himself, risen from the dead.
<p/>Why, how did you tear yourself away? What did you vonsohn there? And how could you get away from the dinner?
<p/>You must be a brazen-faced fellow! I am that myself, but I am surprised at you, brother! Jump in, jump in!
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) pass, Ivan. It will be fun. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) can lie somewhere at our feet. Will you lie at our feet, von Sohn?
<p/>But Ivan, who had by now taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) seat, without a word gave Maximov a violent punch in the breast and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) flying.
<p/>Or perch on the box with the coachman. Skip on to the box, von Sohn!'' It was quite by chance he (<font color='blue'><b>Sohn</b></font>) did not fall.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Drive on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan shouted angrily to the coachman. '' Why, what are you doing, what are you about? Why did you do that?''
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch protested. But the carriage had already driven away. Ivan made no reply. '' Well, you are a fellow,'' Fyodor Pavlovitch said again.
<p/>After a pause of two minutes, looking askance at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) son, <div class="bookquote">``Why, it was you got up all this monastery business.
<p/>You urged it, you approved of it. Why are you angry now?''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>'' You've talked rot enough. You might rest a bit now,'' Ivan snapped sullenly.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch was silent again for two minutes. '' A drop of brandy would be nice now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) observed sententiously, but Ivan made no response.
<p/>'' You shall have some, too, when we get home. '' Ivan was still silent. Fyodor Pavlovitch waited another two minutes.
<p/>But I shall take Alyosha away from the monastery, though you will dislike it so much, most honored Karl von Moor.
<p/>'' '' Ivan shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) shoulders contemptuously, and turning away stared at the road. And they did not speak again all the way home.
<p/>In The Servants' Quarters The Karamazovs' house was far from being in the center of the town, but it was not quite outside it.
<p/>Book III. The Sensualists Chapter I. It was a pleasant-looking old house of two stories, painted gray, with a red iron roof.
<p/>It was roomy and snug, and might still last many years. There were all sorts of unexpected little cupboards and closets and staircases.
<p/>There were rats in it, but Fyodor Pavlovitch did not altogether dislike them. '' One doesn't feel so solitary when one's left alone in the evening,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) used to say.
<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) habit to send the servants away to the lodge for the night and to lock himself up alone.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch used to have the cooking done there, although there was a kitchen in the house; he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) did not like the smell of cooking, and, winter and summer alike, the dishes were carried in across the courtyard.
<p/>The lodge was a roomy and solid building in the yard. The house was built for a large family; there was room for five times as many, with their servants.
<p/>But at the time of our story there was no one living in the house but Fyodor Pavlovitch and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) son Ivan.
<p/>And in the lodge there were only three servants: old Grigory, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) old wife Marfa, and a young man called Smerdyakov.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was firm and determined and went blindly and obstinately for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) object, if once he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had been brought by any reasons -LRB-and they were often very illogical ones-RRB- to believe that it was immutably right.
<p/>Of these three we must say a few words. Of old Grigory we have said something already. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was honest and incorruptible.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) wife, Marfa Ignatyevna, had obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's will implicitly all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) life, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had pestered him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) terribly after the emancipation of the serfs.
<p/>But Grigory decided then, once for all, that <div class="bookquote">``the woman's talking nonsense, for every woman is dishonest,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grigory/Grigory Vassilyevitch</b></font>)</div>and that they ought not to leave their old master, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) might be, for <div class="bookquote">``that was now their duty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was set on leaving Fyodor Pavlovitch and opening a little shop in Moscow with their small savings. <div class="bookquote">``Do you understand what duty is?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) asked Marfa Ignatyevna. '' I understand what duty means, Grigory Vassilyevitch, but why it's our duty to stay here
<p/>I never shall understand,'' Marfa answered firmly. '' Well, don't understand then. But so it shall be. And you hold your tongue.
<p/>'' And so it was. They did not go away, and Fyodor Pavlovitch promised them a small sum for wages, and paid it regularly.
<p/>Grigory knew, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had an indisputable influence over his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) master. It was true, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was aware of it.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch was an obstinate and cunning buffoon, yet, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) will was strong enough <div class="bookquote">``in some of the affairs of life,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pavlovitch an buffoon</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) expressed it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) found himself, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) surprise, extremely feeble in facing certain other emergencies.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) weaknesses and was afraid of them. There are positions in which one has to keep a sharp look out.
<p/>Many times in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) life Fyodor Pavlovitch had only just escaped a sound thrashing through Grigory's intervention, and on each occasion the old servant gave him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) a good lecture.
<p/>And that's not easy without a trustworthy man, and Grigory was a most trustworthy man. But it wasn't only thrashings that Fyodor Pavlovitch was afraid of.
<p/>There were graver occasions, and very subtle and complicated ones, when Fyodor Pavlovitch could not have explained the extraordinary craving for some one faithful and devoted, which sometimes unaccountably came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) all in a moment.
<p/>Corrupt and often cruel in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) lust, like some noxious insect, Fyodor Pavlovitch was sometimes, in moments of drunkenness, overcome by superstitious terror and a moral convulsion which took an almost physical form.
<p/>It was almost a morbid condition. '' My soul's simply quaking in my throat at those times,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) used to say.
<p/>At such moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) liked to feel that there was near at hand, in the lodge if not in the room, a strong, faithful man, virtuous and unlike himself, who had seen all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) debauchery and knew all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) secrets, but was ready in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) devotion to overlook all that, not to oppose him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), above all, not to reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) or threaten him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with anything, either in this world or in the next, and, in case of need, to defend him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--from whom?
<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needed was to feel that there was another man, an old and tried friend, that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might call him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sick moments merely to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) face, or, perhaps, exchange some quite irrelevant words with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).
<p/>From somebody unknown, but terrible and dangerous. And if the old servant were not angry, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) felt comforted, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) were angry, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was more dejected.
<p/>It happened even -LRB-very rarely however-RRB- that Fyodor Pavlovitch went at night to the lodge to wake Grigory and fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) for a moment.
<p/>When the old man came, Fyodor Pavlovitch would begin talking about the most trivial matters, and would soon let him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) go again, sometimes even with a jest.
<p/>And after he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had gone, Fyodor Pavlovitch would get into bed with a curse and sleep the sleep of the just.
<p/>Something of the same sort had happened to Fyodor Pavlovitch on Alyosha's arrival. Alyosha <div class="bookquote">``pierced his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) heart''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>by <div class="bookquote">``living with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), seeing everything and blaming nothing.
<p/>Moreover, Alyosha brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) something his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) father had never known before: a complete absence of contempt for him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) and an invariable kindness, a perfectly natural unaffected devotion to the old man who deserved it so little.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>All this was a complete surprise to the old profligate, who had dropped all family ties. It was a new and surprising experience for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), who had till then loved nothing but ``evil.
<p/>When Alyosha had left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) confessed to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had learnt something he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not till then been willing to learn.
<p/>I have mentioned already that Grigory had detested Adelaďda Ivanovna, the first wife of Fyodor Pavlovitch and the mother of Dmitri, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had, on the contrary, protected Sofya Ivanovna, the poor <div class="bookquote">``crazy woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sofya Ivanovna/Sofya</b></font>)</div>against his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) master and any one who chanced to speak ill or lightly of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) sympathy for the unhappy wife had become something sacred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), so that even now, twenty years after, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) could not bear a slighting allusion to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) from any one, and would at once check the offender.
<p/>It was impossible to tell at first sight whether he (<font color='blue'><b>offender</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>offender</b></font>) meek, obedient wife; but he (<font color='blue'><b>offender</b></font>) really did love her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew it.
<p/>Marfa Ignatyevna was by no means foolish; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was probably, indeed, cleverer than her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, or, at least, more prudent than he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in worldly affairs,
<p/>and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had given in to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in everything without question or complaint ever since her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) marriage, and respected him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) spiritual superiority.
<p/>It was remarkable how little they spoke to one another in the course of their lives, and only of the most necessary daily affairs.
<p/>The grave and dignified Grigory thought over all his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cares and duties alone, so that Marfa Ignatyevna had long grown used to knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not need her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) advice.
<p/>'' Externally, Grigory was cold, dignified and taciturn, and spoke, weighing his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) words, without frivolity. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband respected her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) silence, and took it as a sign of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) good sense.
<p/>Once during the year after Fyodor Pavlovitch's marriage with Adelaďda Ivanovna, the village girls and women--at that time serfs--were called together before the house to sing and dance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the Green Meadows,''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>when Marfa, at that time a young woman, skipped forward and danced <div class="bookquote">``the Russian Dance,''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>not in the village fashion, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had danced it when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a servant in the service of the rich Miüsov family, in their private theater, where the actors were taught to dance by a dancing master from Moscow.
<p/>Grigory saw how his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wife danced, and, an hour later, at home in their cottage he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a lesson, pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hair a little.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had never beaten her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) but once, and then only slightly. They were beginning But there it ended: the beating was never repeated, and Marfa Ignatyevna gave up dancing.
<p/>God had not blessed them with children. One child was born but it died. Grigory was fond of children, and was not ashamed of showing it.
<p/>When Adelaďda Ivanovna had run away, Grigory took Dmitri, then a child of three years old, combed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) hair and washed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) in a tub with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) own hands, and looked after him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) for almost a year.
<p/>Afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had looked after Ivan and Alyosha, for which the general's widow had rewarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) with a slap in the face; but I have already related all that.
<p/>The only happiness his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) own child had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had been in the anticipation of its birth. When it was born, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was overwhelmed with grief and horror.
<p/>Grigory was so crushed by this, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was not only silent till the day of the christening, but kept away in the garden.
<p/>The baby had six fingers. It was spring, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) spent three days digging the kitchen garden. The third day was fixed for christening the baby: mean-time Grigory had reached a conclusion.
<p/>Going into the cottage where the clergy were assembled and the visitors had arrived, including Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was to stand god- father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) suddenly announced that the baby <div class="bookquote">``ought not to be christened at all.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the baby</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) announced this quietly, briefly, forcing out his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) words, and gazing with dull intentness at the priest. '' Why not?
<p/>'' asked the priest with good-humored surprise. '' Because it's a dragon,'' muttered Grigory. '' A dragon? What dragon? '' Grigory did not speak for some time.
<p/>'' It's a confusion of nature,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) muttered vaguely, but firmly, and obviously unwilling to say more. They laughed, and of course christened the poor baby.
<p/>Grigory prayed earnestly at the font, but his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) opinion of the new-born child remained unchanged. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) did not interfere in any way.
<p/>As long as the sickly infant lived he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) scarcely looked at it, tried indeed not to notice it, and for the most part kept out of the cottage.
<p/>But when, at the end of a fortnight, the baby died of thrush, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) himself laid the child in its little coffin, looked at it in profound grief, and when they were filling up the shallow little grave he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) knees and bowed down to the earth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) did not for years afterwards mention his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) child, nor did Marfa speak of the baby before him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), and, even if Grigory were not present, she (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) never spoke of it above a whisper.
<p/>Marfa observed that, from the day of the burial, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) devoted himself to <div class="bookquote">``religion,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and took to reading the Lives of the Saints , for the most part sitting alone and in silence, and always putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) big, round, silver-rimmed spectacles.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was fond of the Book of Job, and had somehow got hold of a copy of the sayings and sermons of <div class="bookquote">``the God-fearing Father Isaac the Syrian,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>which he (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) read persistently for years together, understanding very little of it, but perhaps prizing and loving it the more for that.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) rarely read aloud, only perhaps in Lent. Of late he (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) had begun to listen to the doctrines of the sect of Flagellants settled in the neighborhood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) was evidently shaken by them, but judged it unfitting to go over to the new faith. His (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) habit of theological reading gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) an expression of still greater gravity.
<p/>And the birth of his (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) deformed child, and its death, had, as though by special design, been accompanied by another strange and marvelous event, which, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) said later, had left a <div class="bookquote">``stamp''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) soul.
<p/>It happened that, on the very night after the burial of his (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) child, Marfa was awakened by the wail of a new-born baby.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) was perhaps predisposed to mysticism. She (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) was frightened and waked her (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) listened and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) thought it was more like some one groaning, <div class="bookquote">``it might be a woman.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) got up and dressed. It was a rather warm night in May. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) went down the steps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) distinctly heard groans coming from the garden.
<p/>But the gate from the yard into the garden was locked at night, and there was no other way of entering it, for it was enclosed all round by a strong, high fence.
<p/>Going back into the house, Grigory lighted a lantern, took the garden key, and taking no notice of the hysterical fears of his (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) wife, who was still persuaded that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heard a child crying, and that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own baby crying and calling for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), went into the garden in silence.
<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) heard at once that the groans came from the bath-house that stood near the garden gate, and that they were the groans of a woman.
<p/>An idiot girl, who wandered about the streets and was known to the whole town by the nickname of Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya -LRB-Stinking Lizaveta-RRB-, had got into the bath- house and had just given birth to a child.
<p/>Opening the door of the bath-house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>) saw a sight which petrified him (<font color='blue'><b>Isaac</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lay dying with the baby beside her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said nothing, for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had never been able to speak. But her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) story needs a chapter to itself. Chapter II.
<p/>This Lizaveta was a dwarfish creature, <div class="bookquote">``not five foot within a wee bit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lizaveta a creature foot</b></font>)</div>as many of the pious old women said pathetically about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) death.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) broad, healthy, red face had a look of blank idiocy and the fixed stare in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes was unpleasant, in spite of their meek expression.
<p/>Lizaveta There was one circumstance which struck Grigory particularly, and confirmed a very unpleasant and revolting suspicion. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wandered about, summer and winter alike, barefooted, wearing nothing but a hempen smock.
<p/>It was always crusted with mud, and had leaves, bits of stick, and shavings clinging to it, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) always slept on the ground and in the dirt.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father, a homeless, sickly drunkard, called Ilya, had lost everything and lived many years as a workman with some well-to-do tradespeople.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) coarse, almost black hair curled like lamb's wool, and formed a sort of huge cap on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother had long been dead.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rarely did so, for every one in the town was ready to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as being an idiot, and so specially dear to God.
<p/>Ilya's employers, and many others in the town, especially of the tradespeople, tried to clothe her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) better, and always rigged her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) out with high boots and sheepskin coat for the winter.
<p/>But, although she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) allowed them to dress her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) up without resisting, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) usually went away, preferably to the cathedral porch, and taking off all that had been given her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)--kerchief, sheepskin, skirt or boots--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) left them there and walked away barefoot in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) smock as before.
<p/>It happened on one occasion that a new governor of the province, making a tour of inspection in our town, saw Lizaveta, and was wounded in his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) tenderest susceptibilities.
<p/>And though he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) was told she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was an idiot, he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) pronounced that for a young woman of twenty to wander about in nothing but a smock was a breach of the proprieties, and must not occur again.
<p/>Spiteful and diseased, Ilya used to beat Lizaveta inhumanly whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ilya</b></font>). But the governor went his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) way, and Lizaveta was left as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was.
<p/>At last her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father died, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) even more acceptable in the eyes of the religious persons of the town, as an orphan.
<p/>In fact, every one seemed to like her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); even the boys did not tease her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and the boys of our town, especially the schoolboys, are a mischievous set.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would walk into strange houses, and no one drove her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) away. Every one was kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) something.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were given a copper, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would take it, and at once drop it in the alms-jug of the church or prison.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were given a roll or bun in the market, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would hand it to the first child she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) met.
<p/>Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would stop one of the richest ladies in the town and give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and the lady would be pleased to take it.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went into an expensive shop, where there were costly goods or money lying about, no one kept watch on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), for they knew that if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) saw thousands of roubles overlooked by them, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would not have touched a farthing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) slept either in the church porch or climbed over a hurdle -LRB-there are many hurdles instead of fences to this day in our town-RRB- into a kitchen garden.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) used at least once a week to turn up <div class="bookquote">``at home,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>that is at the house of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father's former employers, and in the winter went there every night, and slept either in the passage or the cowhouse.
<p/>People were amazed that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could stand such a life, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was accustomed to it, and, although she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was so tiny, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was of a robust constitution.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) herself never tasted anything but black bread and water. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) scarcely ever went to church. Some of the townspeople declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did all this only from pride, but that is hardly credible.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could hardly speak, and only from time to time uttered an inarticulate grunt. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) have been proud? It happened one clear, warm, moonlight night in September -LRB-many years ago-RRB-
<p/>five or six drunken revelers were returning from the club at a very late hour, according to our provincial notions. They passed through the <div class="bookquote">``back- way,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>which led between the back gardens of the houses, with hurdles on either side.
<p/>This way leads out on to the bridge over the long, stinking pool which we were accustomed to call a river.
<p/>Among the nettles and burdocks under the hurdle our revelers saw Lizaveta asleep. They stopped to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>), laughing, and began jesting with unbridled licentiousness.
<p/>It occurred to one young gentleman to make the whimsical inquiry whether any one could possibly look upon such an animal as a woman, and so forth....
<p/>But Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was among them, sprang forward and declared that it was by no means impossible, and that, indeed, there was a certain piquancy about it, and so on....
<p/>They all pronounced with lofty repugnance that it was impossible. It is true that at that time he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was overdoing his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) part as a buffoon.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) liked to put himself forward and entertain the company, ostensibly on equal terms, of course, though in reality he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was on a servile footing with them.
<p/>It was just at the time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had received the news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) first wife's death in Petersburg, and, with crape upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) hat, was drinking and behaving so shamelessly that even the most reckless among us were shocked at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>).
<p/>The revelers, of course, laughed at this unexpected opinion; and one of them even began challenging him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) to act upon it.
<p/>The others repelled the idea even more emphatically, although still with the utmost hilarity, and at last they went on their way.
<p/>Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch swore that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had gone with them, and perhaps it was so , no one knows for certain, and no one ever knew.
<p/>But five or six months later, all the town was talking, with intense and sincere indignation, of Lizaveta's condition, and trying to find out who was the miscreant who had wronged her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Then suddenly a terrible rumor was all over the town that this miscreant was no other than Fyodor Pavlovitch. Who set the rumor going?
<p/>Of that drunken band five had left the town and the only one still among us was an elderly and much respected civil councilor, the father of grown-up daughters, who could hardly have spread the tale, even if there had been any foundation for it.
<p/>But rumor pointed straight at Fyodor Pavlovitch, and persisted in pointing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>). Of course this was no great grievance to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) would not have troubled to contradict a set of tradespeople.
<p/>In those days he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was proud, and did not condescend to talk except in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) own circle of the officials and nobles, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) entertained so well.
<p/>At the time, Grigory stood up for his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) master vigorously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) provoked quarrels and altercations in defense of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) and succeeded in bringing some people round to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) side.
<p/>It's the wench's own fault,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) asserted, and the culprit was Karp, a dangerous convict, who had escaped from prison and whose name was well known to us, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Karp</b></font>) had hidden in our town.
<p/>This conjecture sounded plausible, for it was remembered that Karp had been in the neighborhood just at that time in the autumn, and had robbed three people.
<p/>'' But this affair and all the talk about it did not estrange popular sympathy from the poor idiot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was better looked after than ever.
<p/>A well-to-do merchant's widow named Kondratyev arranged to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) house at the end of April, meaning not to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) go out until after the confinement.
<p/>They kept a constant watch over her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), but in spite of their vigilance she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) escaped on the very last day, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) way into Fyodor Pavlovitch's garden.
<p/>How, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) condition, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) managed to climb over the high, strong fence remained a mystery. Some maintained that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) must have been lifted over by somebody; others hinted at something more uncanny.
<p/>The most likely explanation is that it happened naturally--that Lizaveta, accustomed to clambering over hurdles to sleep in gardens, had somehow managed to climb this fence, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) condition, and had leapt down, injuring herself.
<p/>Grigory rushed to Marfa and sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) to Lizaveta, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) ran to fetch an old midwife who lived close by.
<p/>They saved the baby, but Lizaveta died at dawn. Grigory took the baby, brought it home, and making his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) wife sit down, put it on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lap.
<p/>'' A child of God--an orphan is akin to all,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and to us above others. Our little lost one has sent us this, who has come from the devil's son and a holy innocent.
<p/>Nurse him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) and weep no more. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So Marfa brought up the child. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was christened Pavel, to which people were not slow in adding Fyodorovitch -LRB-son of Fyodor-RRB-.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch did not object to any of this, and thought it amusing, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) persisted vigorously in denying his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) responsibility.
<p/>The townspeople were pleased at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) adopting the foundling. Later on, Fyodor Pavlovitch invented a surname for the child, calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) Smerdyakov, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) mother's nickname.
<p/>So this Smerdyakov became Fyodor Pavlovitch's second servant, and was living in the lodge with Grigory and Marfa at the time our story begins.
<p/>I ought to say something of this Smerdyakov, but I am ashamed of keeping my readers' attention so long occupied with these common menials, and I will go back to my story, hoping to say more of Smerdyakov in the course of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was employed as cook. Chapter III. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart-- In Verse Alyosha remained for some time irresolute after hearing the command his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) father shouted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) from the carriage.
<p/>But in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) uneasiness he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) did not stand still. That was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) went at once to the kitchen to find out what his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) father had been doing above.
<p/>I hasten to add that his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) father's shouts, commanding him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) to return home <div class="bookquote">``with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) mattress and pillow''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>did not frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) in the least.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) set off, trusting that on the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) would find some answer to the doubt tormenting him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) understood perfectly that those peremptory shouts were merely <div class="bookquote">``a flourish''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>to produce an effect.
<p/>In the same way a tradesman in our town who was celebrating his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) name-day with a party of friends, getting angry at being refused more vodka, smashed up his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) own crockery and furniture and tore his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) own and his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) wife's clothes, and finally broke his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) windows, all for the sake of effect.
<p/>Next day, of course, when he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) was sober, he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) regretted the broken cups and saucers. Alyosha knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) father would let him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) go back to the monastery next day, possibly even that evening.
<p/>Alyosha was certain that no one in the whole world ever would want to hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>), and, what is more, he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) knew that no one could hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>).
<p/>This was for him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) an axiom, assumed once for all without question, and he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) went his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) way without hesitation, relying on it.
<p/>But at that moment an anxiety of a different sort disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>), and worried him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) the more because he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) could not formulate it.
<p/>It was the fear of a woman, of Katerina Ivanovna, who had so urgently entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) in the note handed to him (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) by Madame Hohlakov to come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) about something.
<p/>This request and the necessity of going had at once aroused an uneasy feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) heart, and this feeling had grown more and more painful all the morning in spite of the scenes at the hermitage and at the Father Superior's.
<p/>Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was fully persuaded that his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) father might hurt any one else, but would not hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not uneasy because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would speak of and what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must answer.
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew little of women, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had spent his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life, from early childhood till he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) entered the monastery, entirely with women.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) simply as a woman. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was afraid of that woman, Katerina Ivanovna. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) from the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had only seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) two or three times, and had only chanced to say a few words to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) as a beautiful, proud, imperious girl.
<p/>It was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) beauty which troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), but something else. And the vagueness of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) apprehension increased the apprehension itself.
<p/>The girl's aims were of the noblest, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew that. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was trying to save his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brother Dmitri simply through generosity, though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had already behaved badly to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>Yet, although Alyosha recognized and did justice to all these fine and generous sentiments, a shiver began to run down his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) back as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) drew near her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) reflected that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not find Ivan, who was so intimate a friend, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), for Ivan was certainly now with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father.
<p/>Dmitri he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was even more certain not to find there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had a foreboding of the reason. And so his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) conversation would be with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) alone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had a great longing to run and see his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother Dmitri before that fateful interview. Without showing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) the letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) could talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) about it.
<p/>But Dmitri lived a long way off, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was sure to be away from home too. Standing still for a minute, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) reached a final decision.
<p/>Crossing himself with a rapid and accustomed gesture, and at once smiling, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) turned resolutely in the direction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) terrible lady.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) house. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) went by the High Street and then across the market-place, it was a long way round.
<p/>Though our town is small, it is scattered, and the houses are far apart. And meanwhile his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) father was expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), and perhaps had not yet forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) command.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) might be unreasonable, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had to make haste to get there and back. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) decided to take a short cut by the back-way, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) knew every inch of the ground.
<p/>This meant skirting fences, climbing over hurdles, and crossing other people's back-yards, where every one he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) met knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) and greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>).
<p/>In this way he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) could reach the High Street in half the time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had to pass the garden adjoining his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) father's, and belonging to a little tumbledown house with four windows.
<p/>The owner of this house, as Alyosha knew, was a bedridden old woman, living with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) daughter, who had been a genteel maid-servant in generals' families in Petersburg.
<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been at home a year, looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sick mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) always dressed up in fine clothes, though her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) old mother
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had sunk into such poverty that they went every day to Fyodor Pavlovitch's kitchen for soup and bread, which Marfa gave readily.
<p/>Yet, though the young woman came up for soup, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had never sold any of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dresses, and one of these even had a long train--a fact which Alyosha had learned from Rakitin, who always knew everything that was going on in the town.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had forgotten it as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) heard it, but now, on reaching the garden, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) remembered the dress with the train, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) head, which had been bowed in thought, and came upon something quite unexpected.
<p/>Over the hurdle in the garden, Dmitri, mounted on something, was leaning forward, gesticulating violently, beckoning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), obviously afraid to utter a word for fear of being overheard.
<p/>Alyosha ran up to the hurdle. '' It's a good thing you looked up. I was nearly shouting to you,'' Mitya said in a joyful, hurried whisper.
<p/>'' Climb in here quickly! How splendid that you've come! I was just thinking of you!'' Alyosha was delighted too, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) did not know how to get over the hurdle.
<p/>Mitya put his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) powerful hand under his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) elbow to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) jump. Tucking up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cassock, Alyosha leapt over the hurdle with the agility of a bare- legged street urchin.
<p/>'' Well done! Now come along,'' said Mitya in an enthusiastic whisper. '' Where? '' whispered Alyosha, looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) and finding himself in a deserted garden with no one near but themselves.
<p/>The garden was small, but the house was at least fifty paces away. '' There's no one here. Why do you whisper?
<p/>'' asked Alyosha. '' Why do I whisper? Deuce take it! '' cried Dmitri at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) voice. ''
<p/>You see what silly tricks nature plays one. I am here in secret, and on the watch. I'll explain later on, but, knowing it's a secret, I began whispering like a fool, when there's no need.
<p/>Let us go. Over there. Till then be quiet. I want to kiss you. Glory to God in the world, Glory to God in me ...
<p/>I was just repeating that, sitting here, before you came. '' The garden was about three acres in extent, and planted with trees only along the fence at the four sides.
<p/>The middle of the garden was an empty grass space, from which several hundredweight of hay was carried in the summer.
<p/>There were also plantations of raspberries and currants and gooseberries laid out along the sides; a kitchen garden had been planted lately near the house.
<p/>There were apple-trees, maples, limes and birch-trees. The garden was let out for a few roubles for the summer. Dmitri led his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) brother to the most secluded corner of the garden.
<p/>There, in a thicket of lime-trees and old bushes of black currant, elder, snowball-tree, and lilac, there stood a tumble-down green summer-house, blackened with age.
<p/>Its walls were of lattice-work, but there was still a roof which could give shelter. God knows when this summer-house was built.
<p/>There was a tradition that it had been put up some fifty years before by a retired colonel called von Schmidt, who owned the house at that time.
<p/>In the summer-house there was a green wooden table fixed in the ground, and round it were some green benches upon which it was still possible to sit.
<p/>Alyosha had at once observed his (<font color='blue'><b>Schmidt</b></font>) brother's exhilarated condition, and on entering the arbor he (<font color='blue'><b>Schmidt</b></font>) saw half a bottle of brandy and a wineglass on the table.
<p/>It was all in decay, the floor was rotting, the planks were loose, the woodwork smelled musty. '' That's brandy,'' Mitya laughed.
<p/>'' I see your look: `He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s drinking again!' Distrust the apparition. Distrust the worthless, lying crowd, And lay aside thy doubts.
<p/>I'm not drinking, I'm only `indulging,' as that pig, your Rakitin, says. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'ll be a civil councilor one day, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'ll always talk about `indulging.'
<p/>I could take you in my arms, Alyosha, and press you to my bosom till I crush you, for in the whole world--in reality--in re-al-
<p/>Sit down. i-ty---LRB-can you take it in?-RRB- I love no one but you!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) uttered the last words in a sort of exaltation.
<p/>'' No one but you and one `jade' I have fallen in love with, to my ruin. But being in love doesn't mean loving.
<p/>You may be in love with a woman and yet hate her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Remember that! I can talk about it gayly still.
<p/>Sit down here by the table and I'll sit beside you and look at you, and go on talking. You shall keep quiet and I'll go on talking, for the time has come.
<p/>But on reflection, you know, I'd better speak quietly, for here--here--you can never tell what ears are listening. I will explain everything; as they say, `the story will be continued.'
<p/>Why have I been longing for you? Why have I been thirsting for you all these days, and just now? -LRB-It's five days since I've cast anchor here.-RRB-
<p/>because I must, because I need you, because to-morrow I shall fly from the clouds, because to-morrow life is ending and beginning.
<p/>Because it's only to you I can tell everything; Have you ever felt, have you ever dreamt of falling down a precipice into a pit?
<p/>That's just how I'm falling, but not in a dream. And I'm not afraid, and don't you be afraid. At least, I am afraid, but I enjoy it.
<p/>It's not enjoyment though, but ecstasy. Damn it all, whatever it is! A strong spirit, a weak spirit, a womanish spirit--whatever it is!
<p/>Let us praise nature: you see what sunshine, how clear the sky is, the leaves are all green, it's still summer; four o'clock in the afternoon and the stillness!
<p/>Where were you going?'' <div class="bookquote">``I was going to father's, but I meant to go to Katerina Ivanovna's first. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), and to father!
<p/>Oo! what a coincidence! Why was I waiting for you? Hungering and thirsting for you in every cranny of my soul and even in my ribs?
<p/>Why, to send you to father and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), Katerina Ivanovna, so as to have done with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) and with father.
<p/>To send an angel. I might have sent any one, but I wanted to send an angel. And here you are on your way to see father and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did you really mean to send me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Alyosha with a distressed expression. '' Stay! You knew it! And I see you understand it all at once.
<p/>But be quiet, be quiet for a time. Don't be sorry, and don't cry. '' Dmitri stood up, thought a moment, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) finger to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) forehead.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'s asked you, written to you a letter or something , that's why you're going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)? You wouldn't be going except for that?''

<p/>Oh, gods, I thank you for sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) by the back-way, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) came to me like the golden fish to the silly old fishermen in the fable!
<p/>Listen, Alyosha, listen, brother! Now I mean to tell you everything, for I must tell some one. An angel in heaven I've told already; but I want to tell an angel on earth.
<p/>You are an angel on earth. You will hear and judge and forgive. And that's what I need, that some one above me should forgive.
<p/>If two people break away from everything on earth and fly off into the unknown, or at least one of them, and before flying off or going to ruin he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) comes to some one else and says, `Do this for me'--some favor never asked before that could only be asked on one's deathbed--would that other refuse, if he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) were a friend or a brother?''

<p/>But the Goddess found no refuge , Found no kindly welcome there, And no temple bearing witness To the worship of the gods.
<p/>From the fields and from the vineyards Came no fruits to deck the feasts, Only flesh of bloodstained victims Smoldered on the altar-fires, And where'er the grieving goddess Turns her (<font color='blue'><b>goddess</b></font>) melancholy gaze, Sunk in vilest degradation
<p/>'' Man his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) loathsomeness displays. '' Mitya broke into sobs and seized Alyosha's hand. '' My dear, my dear, in degradation, in degradation now, too.
<p/>There's a terrible amount of suffering for man on earth, a terrible lot of trouble. Don't think I'm only a brute in an officer's uniform, wallowing in dirt and drink.
<p/>I hardly think of anything but of that degraded man--if only I'm not lying. I pray God I'm not lying and showing off.
<p/>Would he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) purge his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul from vileness And attain to light and worth, He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) must turn and cling for ever To his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ancient Mother Earth.
<p/>I think about that man because I am that man myself. But the difficulty is how am I to cling for ever to Mother Earth.
<p/>I don't kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>). I don't cleave to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) bosom. Am I to become a peasant or a shepherd? I go on
<p/>and I don't know whether I'm going to shame or to light and joy. That's the trouble, for everything in the world is a riddle!
<p/>And whenever I've happened to sink into the vilest degradation -LRB-and it's always been happening-RRB- I always read that poem about Ceres and man.
<p/>For when I do leap into the pit, I go headlong with my heels up, and am pleased to be falling in that degrading attitude, and pride myself upon it.
<p/>Has it reformed me? Never! For I'm a Karamazov. And in the very depths of that degradation I begin a hymn of praise.
<p/>Let me be vile and base, only let me kiss the hem of the veil in which my God is shrouded.
<p/>Though I may be following the devil, I am Thy son, O Lord, and I love Thee, and I feel the joy without which the world cannot stand.
<p/>Let me be accursed. Joy everlasting fostereth The soul of all creation, It is her (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) secret ferment fires The cup of life with flame. '
<p/>the grass hath turned Each blade towards the light And solar systems have evolved From chaos and dark night, Filling the realms of boundless space Beyond the sage's sight.
<p/>At bounteous Nature's kindly breast, All things that breathe drink Joy, And birds and beasts and creeping things All follow where She (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) leads.
<p/>Tis at her (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) beck Her (<font color='blue'><b>Joy</b></font>) gifts to man are friends in need, The wreath, the foaming must, To angels--vision of God's throne, To insects--sensual lust.
<p/>But enough poetry! I am in tears; let me cry. It may be foolishness that every one would laugh at. But you won't laugh.
<p/>Your eyes are shining, too. Enough poetry. I want to tell you now about the insects to whom God gave <div class="bookquote">``sensual lust.
<p/>All we Karamazovs are such insects, and, angel as you are, that insect lives in you, too, and will stir up a tempest in your blood.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>To insects--sensual lust. I am that insect, brother, and it is said of me specially. Tempests, because sensual lust is a tempest--worse than a tempest!
<p/>It is terrible because it has not been fathomed and never can be fathomed, for God sets us nothing but riddles.
<p/>Beauty is a terrible and awful thing! Here the boundaries meet and all contradictions exist side by side. I am not a cultivated man, brother, but I've thought a lot about this.
<p/>It's terrible what mysteries there are! Too many riddles weigh men down on earth. We must solve them as we can, and try to keep a dry skin in the water.
<p/>I can't endure the thought that a man of lofty mind and heart begins with the ideal of the Madonna and ends with the ideal of Sodom.
<p/>What's still more awful is that a man with the ideal of Sodom in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul does not renounce the ideal of the Madonna, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart may be on fire with that ideal, genuinely on fire, just as in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) days of youth and innocence.
<p/>Beauty! Yes, man is broad, too broad, indeed. I'd have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) narrower. The devil only knows what to make of it!
<p/>What to the mind is shameful is beauty and nothing else to the heart. Is there beauty in Sodom? Believe me, that for the immense mass of mankind beauty is found in Sodom.
<p/>Did you know that secret? The awful thing is that beauty is mysterious as well as terrible. God and the devil are fighting there and the battlefield is the heart of man.
<p/>But a man always talks of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own ache. Listen, now to come to facts. '' Chapter IV. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart--
<p/>In Anecdote <div class="bookquote">``I was leading a wild life then. Father said just now that I spent several thousand roubles in seducing young girls.
<p/>That's a swinish invention, and there was nothing of the sort. And if there was, I didn't need money simply for that .
<p/>With me money is an accessory, the overflow of my heart, the framework. To-day she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would be my lady, to-morrow a wench out of the streets in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) place.
<p/>Sometimes I gave it to the ladies, too, for they'll take it greedily, that must be admitted, and be pleased and thankful for it.
<p/>I entertained them both. I threw away money by the handful on music, rioting, and gypsies. Ladies used to be fond of me: not all of them, but it happened, it happened.
<p/>But I always liked side-paths, little dark back-alleys behind the main road--there one finds adventures and surprises, and precious metal in the dirt.
<p/>I am speaking figuratively, brother. In the town I was in, there were no such back-alleys in the literal sense, but morally there were.
<p/>If you were like me, you'd know what that means. I loved vice, I loved the ignominy of vice. I loved cruelty; am I not a bug, am I not a noxious insect?
<p/>In fact a Karamazov! Once we went, a whole lot of us, for a picnic, in seven sledges. It was dark, it was winter, and I began squeezing a girl's hand, and forced her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to kiss me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was the daughter of an official, a sweet, gentle, submissive creature. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) allowed me, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) allowed me much in the dark.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought, poor thing, that I should come next day to make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) an offer -LRB-I was looked upon as a good match, too-RRB-.
<p/>But I didn't say a word to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for five months. I used to see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in a corner at dances -LRB-we were always having dances-RRB-, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes watching me.
<p/>I saw how they glowed with fire--a fire of gentle indignation. This game only tickled that insect lust I cherished in my soul.
<p/>Five months later she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) married an official and left the town, still angry, and still, perhaps, in love with me. Now they live happily.
<p/>Observe that I told no one. I didn't boast of it. Though I'm full of low desires, and love what's low, I'm not dishonorable.
<p/>You're blushing; your eyes flashed. Enough of this filth with you. And all this was nothing much-- wayside blossoms ŕ la Paul de Kock--
<p/>though the cruel insect had already grown strong in my soul. I've a perfect album of reminiscences, brother. God bless them, the darlings.
<p/>I tried to break it off without quarreling. And I never gave them away. I never bragged of one of them.
<p/>No, I'm going to tell you something more curious; and don't be surprised that I'm glad to tell you, instead of being ashamed.
<p/>But that's enough. You can't suppose I brought you here simply to talk of such nonsense. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' You say that because I blushed,'' Alyosha said suddenly.
<p/>'' I wasn't blushing at what you were saying or at what you've done. I blushed because I am the same as you are.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You? Come, that's going a little too far!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>'' No, it's not too far,'' said Alyosha warmly -LRB-obviously the idea was not a new one-RRB-.
<p/>'' The ladder's the same. I'm at the bottom step, and you're above, somewhere about the thirteenth. That's how I see it.
<p/>But it's all the same. Absolutely the same in kind. Any one on the bottom step is bound to go up to the top one.''

<p/>Although the old man told lies about my seducing innocence, there really was something of the sort in my tragedy, though it was only once, and then it did not come off.
<p/>The old man who has reproached me with what never happened does not even know of this fact; I never told any one about it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told me once that she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d devour you one day. There, there, I won't! You're the first, except Ivan, of course--Ivan knows everything.

<p/>'' I was lieutenant in a line regiment, but still I was under supervision, like a kind of convict. Yet I was awfully well received in the little town.
<p/>I spent money right and left. I was thought to be rich; I thought so myself. But I must have pleased them in other ways as well.
<p/>Although they shook their heads over me, they liked me. My colonel, who was an old man, took a sudden dislike to me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was always down upon me, but I had powerful friends, and, moreover, all the town was on my side, so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't do me much harm.
<p/>I was in fault myself for refusing to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with proper respect. I was proud. This obstinate old fellow, who was really a very good sort, kind-hearted and hospitable, had had two wives, both dead.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a young woman of four and twenty when I was there, and was living with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father and an aunt, her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's sister.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) first wife, who was of a humble family, left a daughter as unpretentious as herself. The aunt was simple and illiterate; the niece was simple but lively.
<p/>I like to say nice things about people. I never knew a woman of more charming character than Agafya--fancy, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) name was Agafya Ivanovna!
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wasn't bad-looking either, in the Russian style: tall, stout, with a full figure, and beautiful eyes, though a rather coarse face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not married, although she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had had two suitors. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) refused them, but was as cheerful as ever. I was intimate with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), not in `that' way, it was pure friendship.
<p/>I have often been friendly with women quite innocently. I used to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with shocking frankness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only laughed.
<p/>Many women like such freedom, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a girl too, which made it very amusing. Another thing, one could never think of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as a young lady.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) aunt lived in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father's house with a sort of voluntary humility, not putting themselves on an equality with other people.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a general favorite, and of use to every one, for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a clever dressmaker. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a talent for it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) services freely without asking for payment, but if any one offered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) payment, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) didn't refuse. The colonel, of course, was a very different matter.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) was one of the chief personages in the district. He (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) kept open house, entertained the whole town, gave suppers and dances.
<p/>At the time I arrived and joined the battalion, all the town was talking of the expected return of the colonel's second daughter, a great beauty, who had just left a fashionable school in the capital.
<p/>This second daughter is Katerina Ivanovna, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was the child of the second wife, who belonged to a distinguished general's family; although, as I learnt on good authority, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) too brought the colonel no money.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had connections, and that was all. There may have been expectations, but they had come to nothing. '' Yet, when the young lady came from boarding-school on a visit, the whole town revived.
<p/>Our most distinguished ladies--two `Excellencies' and a colonel's wife--and all the rest following their lead, at once took her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) up and gave entertainments in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) honor.
<p/>I took no notice, I went on as wildly as before, and one of my exploits at the time set all the town talking.
<p/>I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes taking my measure one evening at the battery commander's, but I didn't go up to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), as though I disdained her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) acquaintance.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was the belle of the balls and picnics, and they got up tableaux vivants in aid of distressed governesses. I did go up and speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) at an evening party not long after.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) scarcely looked at me, and compressed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lips scornfully. ' Wait a bit. I'll have my revenge,' thought I. I behaved like an awful fool on many occasions at that time, and I was conscious of it myself.
<p/>What made it worse was that I felt that `Katenka' was not an innocent boarding-school miss, but a person of character, proud and really high-principled; above all, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had education and intellect, and I had neither.
<p/>You think I meant to make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) an offer? No, I simply wanted to revenge myself, because I was such a hero
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) didn't seem to feel it. '' Meanwhile, I spent my time in drink and riot, till the lieutenant-colonel put me under arrest for three days.
<p/>Just at that time father sent me six thousand roubles in return for my sending him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a deed giving up all claims upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--settling our accounts, so to speak, and saying that I wouldn't expect anything more.
<p/>Until I came here, Alyosha, till the last few days, indeed, perhaps even now, I haven't been able to make head or tail of my money affairs with father.
<p/>I didn't understand a word of it at the time. But never mind that, we'll talk of it later. '' Just as I received the money, I got a letter from a friend telling me something that interested me immensely.
<p/>The authorities, I learnt, were dissatisfied with our lieutenant-colonel. He (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) was suspected of irregularities; in fact, his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) enemies were preparing a surprise for him (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>).
<p/>And then the commander of the division arrived, and kicked up the devil of a shindy. Shortly afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was ordered to retire.
<p/>I won't tell you how it all happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had enemies certainly. Suddenly there was a marked coolness in the town towards him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) and all his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) family.
<p/>I met Agafya Ivanovna, with whom I'd always kept up a friendship, and said, `Do you know there's a deficit of 4,500 roubles of government money in your father's accounts?'
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friends all turned their backs on him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Then I took my first step. '' `What do you mean? What makes you say so?
<p/>The general was here not long ago, and everything was all right.' '' `Then it was, but now it isn't.' ''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) was terribly scared. '' `Don't frighten me!' she (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) said. ' Who told you so?' '' `Don't be uneasy,' I said, 'I won't tell any one.
<p/>I only wanted, in view of <div class="bookquote">``possibilities,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>to add, that when they demand that 4,500 roubles from your father, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can't produce it, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll be tried, and made to serve as a common soldier in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) old age, unless you like to send me your young lady secretly.
<p/>You know I'm as silent as the tomb. I've just had money paid me. I'll give her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) four thousand, if you like, and keep the secret religiously.'
<p/>'' `Ah, you scoundrel!'--that's what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. ' You wicked scoundrel! How dare you!' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went away furiously indignant, while I shouted after her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) once more that the secret should be kept sacred.
<p/>Those two simple creatures, Agafya and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) aunt, I may as well say at once, behaved like perfect angels all through this business.
<p/>They genuinely adored their `Katya,' thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) far above them, and waited on her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>), hand and foot. But Agafya told her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) of our conversation.
<p/>I found that out afterwards. She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) didn't keep it back, and of course that was all I wanted. '' Suddenly the new major arrived to take command of the battalion.
<p/>The old lieutenant-colonel was taken ill at once, couldn't leave his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) room for two days, and didn't hand over the government money.
<p/>But I knew for a fact, and had known for a long time, that for the last four years the money had never been in his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) hands except when the Commander made his (<font color='blue'><b>Commander</b></font>) visits of inspection.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Commander</b></font>) used to lend it to a trustworthy person, a merchant of our town called Trifonov, an old widower, with a big beard and gold-rimmed spectacles.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>widower</b></font>) used to go to the fair, do a profitable business with the money, and return the whole sum to the colonel, bringing with it a present from the fair, as well as interest on the loan.
<p/>But this time -LRB-I heard all about it quite by chance from Trifonov's son and heir, a driveling youth and one of the most vicious in the world-RRB---this time, I say, Trifonov brought nothing back from the fair.
<p/>Dr. Kravchenko declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) really was ill. The lieutenant-colonel flew to him (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>). ' I've never received any money from you, and couldn't possibly have received any.'
<p/>So now our lieutenant-colonel is confined to the house, with a towel round his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) head, while they're all three busy putting ice on it.
<p/>All at once an orderly arrives on the scene with the book and the order to `hand over the battalion money immediately, within two hours.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) signed the book -LRB-I saw the signature in the book afterwards-RRB-, stood up, saying he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) would put on his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) uniform, ran to his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) bedroom, loaded his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) double-barreled gun with a service bullet, took the boot off his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) right foot, fixed the gun against his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) chest, and began feeling for the trigger with his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) foot.
<p/>That was all the answer he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) got. But Agafya, remembering what I had told her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), had her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) suspicions. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stole up and peeped into the room just in time.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) rushed in, flung herself upon him (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) from behind, threw her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) arms round him (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>), and the gun went off, hit the ceiling, but hurt no one.
<p/>The others ran in, took away the gun, and held him (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) by the arms. I heard all about this afterwards. I was at home, it was getting dusk, and I was just preparing to go out.
<p/>I had dressed, brushed my hair, scented my handkerchief, and taken up my cap, when suddenly the door opened, and facing me in the room stood Katerina Ivanovna.
<p/>'' It's strange how things happen sometimes. No one had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) in the street, so that no one knew of it in the town.
<p/>They were most obliging old things, ready to do anything for me, and at my request were as silent afterwards as two cast-iron posts.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) walked in and looked straight at me, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) dark eyes determined, even defiant, but on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) lips and round her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) mouth I saw uncertainty.
<p/>I lodged with two decrepit old ladies, who looked after me. Of course I grasped the position at once. '' `My sister told me,' she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) began, `that you would give me 4,500 roubles if I came to you for it--myself.
<p/>I have come ... give me the money!' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) couldn't keep it up. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was breathless, frightened, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) voice failed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mouth and the lines round it quivered.
<p/>Alyosha, are you listening, or are you asleep?'' '' Mitya, I know you will tell the whole truth,'' said Alyosha in agitation.
<p/>'' I am telling it. If I tell the whole truth just as it happened I shan't spare myself. My first idea was a--Karamazov one.
<p/>Once I was bitten by a centipede, brother, and laid up a fortnight with fever from it. Well, I felt a centipede biting at my heart then--a noxious insect, you understand?
<p/>I looked her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) up and down. You've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'s a beauty. But she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was beautiful in another way then. At that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was beautiful because she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was noble, and I was a scoundrel;
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) in all the grandeur of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) generosity and sacrifice for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) father, and I--a bug! And, scoundrel as I was, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was altogether at my mercy, body and soul.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was hemmed in. I tell you frankly, that thought, that venomous thought, so possessed my heart that it almost swooned with suspense.
<p/>It seemed as if there could be no resisting it; as though I should act like a bug, like a venomous spider, without a spark of pity.
<p/>Understand, I should have gone next day to ask for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hand, so that it might end honorably, so to speak, and that nobody would or could know.
<p/>And at that very second some voice seemed to whisper in my ear, `But when you come to-morrow to make your proposal, that girl won't even see you; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll order her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) coachman to kick you out of the yard.
<p/>I could scarcely breathe. For though I'm a man of base desires, I'm honest. <div class="bookquote">``Publish it through all the town,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``I'm not afraid of you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>' I looked at the young lady, my voice had not deceived me. That is how it would be, not a doubt of it.
<p/>I longed to play her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) the nastiest swinish cad's trick: to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with a sneer, and on the spot where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stood before me to stun her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with a tone of voice that only a shopman could use.
<p/>I could see from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face now that I should be turned out of the house. My spite was roused. '' `Four thousand!
<p/>What do you mean? I was joking. You've been counting your chickens too easily, madam. Two hundred, if you like, with all my heart.
<p/>But four thousand is not a sum to throw away on such frivolity. You've put yourself out to no purpose.' ''
<p/>I should have lost the game, of course. She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)'d have run away. But it would have been an infernal revenge. It would have been worth it all.
<p/>Would you believe it, it has never happened to me with any other woman, not one, to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at such a moment with hatred.
<p/>But, on my oath, I looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for three seconds, or five perhaps, with fearful hatred--that hate which is only a hair's-breadth from love, from the maddest love!
<p/>I went to the window, put my forehead against the frozen pane, and I remember the ice burnt my forehead like fire.
<p/>I'd have howled with regret all the rest of my life, only to have played that trick. '' I did not keep her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) long, don't be afraid.
<p/>I turned round, went up to the table, opened the drawer and took out a banknote for five thousand roubles -LRB-it was lying in a French dictionary-RRB-.
<p/>Then I showed it her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in silence, folded it, handed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), opened the door into the passage, and, stepping back, made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a deep bow, a most respectful, a most impressive bow, believe me!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shuddered all over, gazed at me for a second, turned horribly pale--white as a sheet, in fact--and all at once, not impetuously but softly, gently, bowed down to my feet--not a boarding-school curtsey, but a Russian bow, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) forehead to the floor.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) jumped up and ran away. I was wearing my sword. I drew it and nearly stabbed myself with it on the spot; why, I don't know.
<p/>It would have been frightfully stupid, of course. I suppose it was from delight. Can you understand that one might kill oneself from delight?
<p/>I only kissed my sword and put it back in the scabbard--which there was no need to have told you, by the way.
<p/>But I didn't stab myself. And I fancy that in telling you about my inner conflict I have laid it on rather thick to glorify myself.
<p/>But let it pass, and to hell with all who pry into the human heart! Well, so much for that `adventure' with Katerina Ivanovna.
<p/>Dmitri got up, took a step or two in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) excitement, pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) handkerchief and mopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) forehead, then sat down again, not in the same place as before, but on the opposite side, so that Alyosha had to turn quite round to face him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>).
<p/>So now Ivan knows of it, and you--no one else. '' Chapter V. The Confession Of A Passionate Heart--<div class="bookquote">``Heels Up ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha, <div class="bookquote">``I understand the first half.

<p/>The next day I told myself that the incident was closed, concluded, that there would be no sequel. It seemed to me caddish to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) an offer.
<p/>On her (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) side she (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) gave no sign of life for the six weeks that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) remained in the town; except, indeed, for one action.
<p/>The day after her (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) visit the maid-servant slipped round with an envelope addressed to me. I tore it open: it contained the change out of the banknote.
<p/>Only four thousand five hundred roubles was needed, but there was a discount of about two hundred on changing it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) only sent me about two hundred and sixty.
<p/>I don't remember exactly, but not a note, not a word of explanation. I searched the packet for a pencil mark--n-nothing!
<p/>Well, I spent the rest of the money on such an orgy that the new major was obliged to reprimand me.
<p/>Well, the lieutenant-colonel produced the battalion money, to the astonishment of every one, for nobody believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) had the money untouched.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>)'d no sooner paid it than he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) fell ill, took to his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) bed, and, three weeks later, softening of the brain set in, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) died five days afterwards.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) was buried with military honors, for he (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) had not had time to receive his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) discharge. Ten days after his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant-colonel</b></font>) funeral, Katerina Ivanovna, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) aunt and sister, went to Moscow.
<p/>I received a tiny note, a sheet of thin blue paper, and on it only one line in pencil: 'I will write to you.
<p/>And, behold, on the very day they went away -LRB-I hadn't seen them, didn't see them off or take leave-RRB- Wait.
<p/>K.' And that was all. '' I'll explain the rest now, in two words. In Moscow their fortunes changed with the swiftness of lightning and the unexpectedness of an Arabian fairy-tale.
<p/>That general's widow, their nearest relation, suddenly lost the two nieces who were her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) heiresses and next-of-kin--both died in the same week of small-pox.
<p/>The old lady, prostrated with grief, welcomed Katya as a daughter, as her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) one hope, clutched at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), altered her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) will in Katya's favor.
<p/>But that concerned the future. Meanwhile she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>), for present use, eighty thousand roubles, as a marriage portion, to do what she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) liked with.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) was an hysterical woman. I saw something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) in Moscow, later. '' Well, suddenly I received by post four thousand five hundred roubles.
<p/>I was speechless with surprise, as you may suppose. Three days later came the promised letter. I have it with me now.
<p/>You must read it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) offers to be my wife, offers herself to me. ' I love you madly,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) says, `even if you don't love me, never mind.
<p/>Be my husband. Don't be afraid. I won't hamper you in any way. I will be your chattel. I will be the carpet under your feet.
<p/>Alyosha, I am not worthy to repeat those lines in my vulgar words and in my vulgar tone, my everlastingly vulgar tone, that I can never cure myself of.
<p/>I want to love you for ever. I want to save you from yourself.' That letter stabs me even now. Do you think I don't mind--that I don't mind still?
<p/>I wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) an answer at once, as it was impossible for me to go to Moscow. I wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) with tears.
<p/>One thing I shall be ashamed of for ever. I referred to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) being rich and having a dowry while I was only a stuck-up beggar!
<p/>Then I wrote at once to Ivan, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) all I could about it in a letter of six pages, and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>I mentioned money! I ought to have borne it in silence, but it slipped from my pen. Why do you look like that?
<p/>Why are you staring at me? Yes, Ivan fell in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) still. I know that.
<p/>I did a stupid thing, in the world's opinion; but perhaps that one stupid thing may be the saving of us all now.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) compares us, do you suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) can love a man like me, especially after all that has happened here?''
<p/>Oo! Don't you see what a lot she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thinks of Ivan, how she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) respects him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)? '' But I am convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) does love a man like you, and not a man like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''

<p/>And yet I'm sincere, I'm sincere. As for Ivan, I can understand how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) must be cursing nature now--with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) intellect, too!
<p/>To a monster who, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is betrothed and all eyes are fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), can't restrain his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) debaucheries--and before the very eyes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) betrothed!
<p/>To see the preference given--to whom, to what? And a man like me is preferred, while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is rejected. And why?
<p/>I've never said a word of this to Ivan, and Ivan of course has never dropped a hint of the sort to me.
<p/>But destiny will be accomplished, and the best man will hold his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ground while the undeserving one will vanish into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back- alley for ever--his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) filthy back-alley, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beloved back-alley, where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is at home and where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will sink in filth and stench at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own free will and with enjoyment.
<p/>Because a girl wants to sacrifice her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life and destiny out of gratitude. It's ridiculous! I've been talking foolishly. I've no words left.
<p/>I use them at random, but it will be as I have said. I shall drown in the back- alley, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will marry Ivan.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop, Dmitri,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha interrupted again with great anxiety. '' There's one thing you haven't made clear yet: you are still betrothed all the same, aren't you?
<p/>How can you break off the engagement if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), your betrothed, doesn't want to?'' '' Yes, formally and solemnly betrothed. It was all done on my arrival in Moscow, with great ceremony, with ikons, all in fine style.
<p/>The general's wife blessed us, and--would you believe it?--congratulated Katya. ' You've made a good choice,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) said, 'I see right through him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>).'
<p/>And--would you believe it?--she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) didn't like Ivan, and hardly greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). I had a lot of talk with Katya in Moscow.
<p/>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) about myself--sincerely, honorably. She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) listened to everything. There was sweet confusion, There were tender words. Though there were proud words, too.

<p/>Confound it, I have some honor! As soon as I began visiting Grushenka, I ceased to be betrothed, and to be an honest man.
<p/>I had heard, and I know for a fact now, that that captain, father's agent, had given Grushenka an I.O.U. of mine for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) to sue me for payment, so as to put an end to me.
<p/>I understand that. Why do you look at me? You see, I went in the first place to beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>). They wanted to scare me.
<p/>I went to beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>). I had had a glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) doesn't strike one at first sight. I knew about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) old merchant, who's lying ill now, paralyzed; but he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>)'s leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) a decent little sum.
<p/>I knew, too, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was fond of money, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hoarded it, and lent it at a wicked rate of interest, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'s a merciless cheat and swindler.
<p/>I went to beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), and I stayed. The storm broke--it struck me down like the plague. I'm plague-stricken still, and I know that everything is over, that there will never be anything more for me.
<p/>The cycle of the ages is accomplished. That's my position. And though I'm a beggar, as fate would have it, I had three thousand just then in my pocket.
<p/>I got gypsies there and champagne and made all the peasants there drunk on it, and all the women and girls.
<p/>I drove with Grushenka to Mokroe, a place twenty-five versts from here. I sent the thousands flying. In three days' time I was stripped bare, but a hero.
<p/>Do you suppose the hero had gained his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) end? Not a sign of it from her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>). I tell you that rogue, Grushenka, has a supple curve all over her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) body.
<p/>You can see it in her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) little foot, even in her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) little toe. I saw it, and kissed it, but that was all, I swear! '
<p/>I'll marry you if you like,' she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) said, `you're a beggar, you know. Say that you won't beat me, and will let me do anything I choose, and perhaps I will marry you.'

<p/>So I had that three thousand roubles in my pocket when I went to see Grushenka, and it was that money we spent at Mokroe.
<p/>Afterwards I pretended I had been to the town, but did not show her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) the post office receipt. I said I had sent the money and would bring the receipt, and so far I haven't brought it.
<p/>I've forgotten it. Now what do you think you're going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) to-day to say? ' He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sends his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) compliments,' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'ll ask you, `What about the money?'

<p/>And do you suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s going to give me money to help to bring that about when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s crazy about her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) himself?
<p/>I know something more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) knows her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) nature; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) knows the cat. And that's not all, either. I can tell you more than that.
<p/>I know that for the last five days he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) has had three thousand drawn out of the bank, changed into notes of a hundred roubles, packed into a large envelope, sealed with five seals, and tied across with red tape.
<p/>You see how well I know all about it! On the envelope is written: `To my angel, Grushenka, when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will come to me.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) scrawled it himself in silence and in secret, and no one knows that the money's there except the valet, Smerdyakov, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) trusts like himself.
<p/>So now he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) has been expecting Grushenka for the last three or four days; he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) hopes she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll come for the money.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) has sent her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) word of it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has sent him (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) word that perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'ll come.

<p/>A purchaser has turned up for the copse: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'ll give eight thousand for the timber. So the old man keeps asking Ivan to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) by going to arrange it.
<p/>It will take him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) two or three days. That's what the old man wants, so that Grushenka can come while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s away.''

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' And I will sit and wait for the miracle. And if it doesn't come to pass--'' Alyosha went thoughtfully towards his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father's house.
<p/>Though there was a dining- room in the house, the table was laid as usual in the drawing-room, which was the largest room, and furnished with old-fashioned ostentation.
<p/>Chapter VI. Smerdyakov He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did in fact find his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father still at table. The furniture was white and very old, upholstered in old, red, silky material.
<p/>On the walls, covered with white paper, which was torn in many places, there hung two large portraits--one of some prince who had been governor of the district thirty years before, and the other of some bishop, also long since dead.
<p/>In the corner opposite the door there were several ikons, before which a lamp was lighted at nightfall ... not so much for devotional purposes as to light the room.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch used to go to bed very late, at three or four o'clock in the morning, and would wander about the room at night or sit in an arm-chair, thinking.
<p/>In the spaces between the windows there were mirrors in elaborate white and gilt frames, of old-fashioned carving. This had become a habit with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) often slept quite alone in the house, sending his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) servants to the lodge; but usually Smerdyakov remained, sleeping on a bench in the hall.
<p/>When Alyosha came in, dinner was over, but coffee and preserves had been served. Fyodor Pavlovitch liked sweet things with brandy after dinner.
<p/>Ivan was also at table, sipping coffee. The servants, Grigory and Smerdyakov, were standing by. Both the gentlemen and the servants seemed in singularly good spirits.
<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) entered the room, Alyosha heard the shrill laugh he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) knew so well, and could tell from the sound of it that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father had only reached the good-humored stage, and was far from being completely drunk.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch was roaring with laughter. '' Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) is! Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) is! '' yelled Fyodor Pavlovitch, highly delighted at seeing Alyosha.
<p/>'' Join us. Sit down. Coffee is a lenten dish, but it's hot and good. I don't offer you brandy, you're keeping the fast.
<p/>But would you like some? No; I'd better give you some of our famous liqueur. Smerdyakov, go to the cupboard, the second shelf on the right.
<p/>Here are the keys. Look sharp!'' Alyosha began refusing the liqueur. '' Never mind. If you won't have it, we will,'' said Fyodor Pavlovitch, beaming.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>answered Alyosha, who had in truth only eaten a piece of bread and drunk a glass of kvas in the Father Superior's kitchen.
<p/>'' But stay--have you dined?'' '' Though I should be pleased to have some hot coffee.'' <div class="bookquote">``Bravo, my darling! He (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>)'ll have some coffee.
<p/>Does it want warming? No, it's boiling. It's capital coffee: Smerdyakov's making. My Smerdyakov's an artist at coffee and at fish patties, and at fish soup, too.
<p/>You must come one day and have some fish soup. Let me know beforehand.... But, stay; didn't I tell you this morning to come home with your mattress and pillow and all?
<p/>Have you brought your mattress? He (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' No, I haven't,'' said Alyosha, smiling, too. '' Ah, but you were frightened, you were frightened this morning, weren't you?
<p/>There, my darling, I couldn't do anything to vex you. Do you know, Ivan, I can't resist the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) looks one straight in the face and laughs?
<p/>It makes me laugh all over. I'm so fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). Alyosha, let me give you my blessing--a father's blessing. ''
<p/>Alyosha rose, but Fyodor Pavlovitch had already changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) mind. '' No, no,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) said. '' I'll just make the sign of the cross over you, for now.
<p/>Sit still. Now we've a treat for you, in your own line, too. It'll make you laugh. Balaam's ass has begun talking to us here--and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Balaam</b></font>) talks!
<p/>How he (<font color='blue'><b>Balaam</b></font>) talks! '' Balaam's ass, it appeared, was the valet, Smerdyakov. He (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) was a young man of about four and twenty, remarkably unsociable and taciturn.
<p/>Not that he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) was shy or bashful. On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) was conceited and seemed to despise everybody. But we must pause to say a few words about him (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) was brought up by Grigory and Marfa, but the boy grew up <div class="bookquote">``with no sense of gratitude,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>as Grigory expressed it; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was an unfriendly boy, and seemed to look at the world mistrustfully.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) used to dress up in a sheet as though it were a surplice, and sang, and waved some object over the dead cat as though it were a censer.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) childhood he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was very fond of hanging cats, and burying them with great ceremony. All this he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did on the sly, with the greatest secrecy.
<p/>Grigory caught him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) once at this diversion and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a sound beating. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shrank into a corner and sulked there for a week.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) doesn't care for you or me, the monster,'' Grigory used to say to Marfa, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) doesn't care for any one.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Grigory/Grigory Vassilyevitch</b></font>)</div>Are you a human being? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, addressing the boy directly. '' You're not a human being. You grew from the mildew in the bath-house.-LRB-2-RRB-
<p/>That's what you are. '' Smerdyakov, it appeared afterwards, could never forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) those words. Grigory taught him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to read and write, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was twelve years old, began teaching him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) the Scriptures.
<p/>But this teaching came to nothing. At the second or third lesson the boy suddenly grinned. '' What's that for?'' asked Grigory, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) threateningly from under his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spectacles.
<p/>'' Oh, nothing. God created light on the first day, and the sun, moon, and stars on the fourth day. Where did the light come from on the first day?
<p/>'' Grigory was thunderstruck. The boy looked sarcastically at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) teacher. There was something positively condescending in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) expression. Grigory could not restrain himself.
<p/>'' I'll show you where! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cried, and gave the boy a violent slap on the cheek. The boy took the slap without a word, but withdrew into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) corner again for some days.
<p/>A week later he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) first attack of the disease to which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was subject all the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) life--epilepsy.
<p/>Till then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had taken no notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) never scolded him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and always gave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a copeck when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of it, his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) attitude to the boy seemed changed at once. Sometimes, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was in good humor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) would send the boy something sweet from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) table.
<p/>But as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) illness, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) showed an active interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), sent for a doctor, and tried remedies, but the disease turned out to be incurable.
<p/>The fits occurred, on an average, once a month, but at various intervals. The fits varied too, in violence: some were light and some were very severe.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch strictly forbade Grigory to use corporal punishment to the boy, and began allowing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to come upstairs to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>One day when the boy was about fifteen, Fyodor Pavlovitch noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lingering by the bookcase, and reading the titles through the glass.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) forbade him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to be taught anything whatever for a time, too. Fyodor Pavlovitch had a fair number of books--over a hundred--but no one ever saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) reading.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) at once gave Smerdyakov the key of the bookcase. <div class="bookquote">``Come, read. You shall be my librarian. You'll be better sitting reading than hanging about the courtyard.
<p/>Come, read this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div>and Fyodor Pavlovitch gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) Evenings in a Cottage near Dikanka . He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) read a little but didn't like it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) did not once smile, and ended by frowning. '' Why? Isn't it funny? '' asked Fyodor Pavlovitch. Smerdyakov did not speak.
<p/>'' Answer, stupid!'' '' It's all untrue,'' mumbled the boy, with a grin. '' Then go to the devil! You have the soul of a lackey.
<p/>Stay, here's Smaragdov's Universal History . That's all true. Read that. '' But Smerdyakov did not get through ten pages of Smaragdov.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lackey</b></font>) thought it dull. So the bookcase was closed again. Shortly afterwards Marfa and Grigory reported to Fyodor Pavlovitch that Smerdyakov was gradually beginning to show an extraordinary fastidiousness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) would sit before his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) soup, take up his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) spoon and look into the soup, bend over it, examine it, take a spoonful and hold it to the light.
<p/>'' What is it? A beetle? '' Grigory would ask. '' A fly, perhaps,'' observed Marfa. The squeamish youth never answered, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) did the same with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) bread, his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) meat, and everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) ate.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) would hold a piece on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) fork to the light, scrutinize it microscopically, and only after long deliberation decide to put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>When Fyodor Pavlovitch heard of this development in Smerdyakov he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) determined to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) cook, and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) to Moscow to be trained.
<p/>'' Ach! What fine gentlemen's airs! '' Grigory muttered, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) spent some years there and came back remarkably changed in appearance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) looked extraordinarily old for his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) age. His (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) face had grown wrinkled, yellow, and strangely emasculate. In character he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) seemed almost exactly the same as before he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) went away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was just as unsociable, and showed not the slightest inclination for any companionship. In Moscow, too, as we heard afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had always been silent.
<p/>Moscow itself had little interest for him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) saw very little there, and took scarcely any notice of anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) went once to the theater, but returned silent and displeased with it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) brushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) clothes most scrupulously twice a day invariably, and was very fond of cleaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) smart calf boots with a special English polish, so that they shone like mirrors.
<p/>On the other hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) came back to us from Moscow well dressed, in a clean coat and clean linen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) turned out a first-rate cook.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) seemed to have as much contempt for the female sex as for men; he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was discreet, almost unapproachable, with them.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) a salary, almost the whole of which Smerdyakov spent on clothes, pomade, perfumes, and such things. Fyodor Pavlovitch began to regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) rather differently.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) fits were becoming more frequent, and on the days he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was ill Marfa cooked, which did not suit Fyodor Pavlovitch at all.
<p/>'' Why are your fits getting worse?'' asked Fyodor Pavlovitch, looking askance at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) new cook. '' Would you like to get married?
<p/>Shall I find you a wife?'' But Smerdyakov turned pale with anger, and made no reply. Fyodor Pavlovitch left him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) with an impatient gesture.
<p/>It happened once, when Fyodor Pavlovitch was drunk, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) dropped in the muddy courtyard three hundred-rouble notes which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had only just received.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) only missed them next day, and was just hastening to search his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) pockets when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) saw the notes lying on the table.
<p/>The great thing was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had absolute confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) honesty. Where had they come from? Smerdyakov had picked them up and brought them in the day before.
<p/>We may add that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) not only believed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) honesty, but had, for some reason, a liking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), although the young man looked as morosely at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as at every one and was always silent.
<p/>'' Well, my lad, I've never met any one like you,'' Fyodor Pavlovitch said shortly, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) ten roubles. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) rarely spoke.
<p/>If it had occurred to any one to wonder at the time what the young man was interested in, and what was in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, it would have been impossible to tell by looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used sometimes to stop suddenly in the house, or even in the yard or street, and would stand still for ten minutes, lost in thought.
<p/>A physiognomist studying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face would have said that there was no thought in it, no reflection, but only a sort of contemplation.
<p/>There is a forest in winter, and on a roadway through the forest, in absolute solitude, stands a peasant in a torn kaftan and bark shoes.
<p/>There is a remarkable picture by the painter Kramskoy, called <div class="bookquote">``Contemplation. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter Kramskoy</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) stands, as it were, lost in thought. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) is not thinking; he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) is <div class="bookquote">``contemplating.
<p/>It's true he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) would come to himself immediately; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) were asked what he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) had been thinking about, he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) would remember nothing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>If any one touched him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) would start and look at one as though awakening and bewildered. Yet probably he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) has, hidden within himself, the impression which had dominated him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) during the period of contemplation.
<p/>Those impressions are dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) and no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) hoards them imperceptibly, and even unconsciously. How and why, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) does not know either.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) may suddenly, after hoarding impressions for many years, abandon everything and go off to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage for his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) soul's salvation, or perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) will suddenly set fire to his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) native village, and perhaps do both.
<p/>There are a good many <div class="bookquote">``contemplatives''  (<font color='red'><b>the peasantry</b></font>)</div>among the peasantry. Well, Smerdyakov was probably one of them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) probably was greedily hoarding up his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) impressions, hardly knowing why.
<p/>Grigory had gone in the morning to make purchases, and had heard from the shopkeeper Lukyanov the story of a Russian soldier which had appeared in the newspaper of that day.
<p/>This soldier had been taken prisoner in some remote part of Asia, and was threatened with an immediate agonizing death if he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) did not renounce Christianity and follow Islam.
<p/>Chapter VII. The Controversy But Balaam's ass had suddenly spoken. The subject was a strange one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Balaam</b></font>) refused to deny his (<font color='blue'><b>Balaam</b></font>) faith, and was tortured, flayed alive, and died, praising and glorifying Christ.
<p/>Grigory had related the story at table. Fyodor Pavlovitch always liked, over the dessert after dinner, to laugh and talk, if only with Grigory.
<p/>Sipping his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) brandy and listening to the story, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) observed that they ought to make a saint of a soldier like that, and to take his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) skin to some monastery.
<p/>This afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) was in a particularly good-humored and expansive mood. '' That would make the people flock, and bring the money in.
<p/>'' Grigory frowned, seeing that Fyodor Pavlovitch was by no means touched, but, as usual, was beginning to scoff. At that moment Smerdyakov, who was standing by the door, smiled.
<p/>Smerdyakov often waited at table towards the end of dinner, and since Ivan's arrival in our town he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had done so every day.
<p/>'' What are you grinning at?'' asked Fyodor Pavlovitch, catching the smile instantly, and knowing that it referred to Grigory. ''
<p/>Well, my opinion is,'' Smerdyakov began suddenly and unexpectedly in a loud voice, <div class="bookquote">``that if that laudable soldier's exploit was so very great there would have been, to my thinking, no sin in it if he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) had on such an emergency renounced, so to speak, the name of Christ and his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) own christening, to save by that same his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) life, for good deeds, by which, in the course of years to expiate his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) cowardice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How could it not be a sin? You're talking nonsense. For that you'll go straight to hell and be roasted there like mutton,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div>put in Fyodor Pavlovitch.
<p/>It was at this point that Alyosha came in, and Fyodor Pavlovitch, as we have seen, was highly delighted at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) appearance.
<p/>As for mutton, that's not so, and there'll be nothing there for this, and there shouldn't be either, if it's according to justice,'' Smerdyakov maintained stoutly.
<p/>'' We're on your subject, your subject,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) chuckled gleefully, making Alyosha sit down to listen. '' '' How do you mean `according to justice'?
<p/>'' Fyodor Pavlovitch cried still more gayly, nudging Alyosha with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) knee. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>)'s a rascal, that's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) is! '' burst from Grigory.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) looked Smerdyakov wrathfully in the face. '' As for being a rascal, wait a little, Grigory Vassilyevitch,'' answered Smerdyakov with perfect composure.
<p/>You'd better consider yourself that, once I am taken prisoner by the enemies of the Christian race, and they demand from me to curse the name of God and to renounce my holy christening, I am fully entitled to act by my own reason, since there would be no sin in it.''
<p/>'' '' But you've said that before. Don't waste words. Prove it,'' cried Fyodor Pavlovitch. '' Soup-maker! '' muttered Grigory contemptuously.
<p/>For as soon as I say to those enemies, `No, I'm not a Christian, and I curse my true God,' then at once, by God's high judgment, I become immediately and specially anathema accursed, and am cut off from the Holy Church, exactly as though I were a heathen, so that at that very instant, not only when I say it aloud, but when I think of saying it, before a quarter of a second has passed, I am cut off.
<p/>'' As for being a soup-maker, wait a bit, too, and consider for yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch, without abusing me. Is that so or not, Grigory Vassilyevitch?''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) addressed Grigory with obvious satisfaction, though he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was really answering Fyodor Pavlovitch's questions, and was well aware of it, and intentionally pretending that Grigory had asked the questions.
<p/>'' Ivan,'' cried Fyodor Pavlovitch suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``stoop down for me to whisper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>)'s got this all up for your benefit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) wants you to praise him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Praise him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div>Ivan listened with perfect seriousness to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father's excited whisper. '' Stay, Smerdyakov, be quiet a minute,'' cried Fyodor Pavlovitch once more.
<p/>'' Ivan, your ear again. '' Ivan bent down again with a perfectly grave face. '' I love you as I do Alyosha.
<p/>Don't think I don't love you. Some brandy?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.--But you're rather drunk yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>thought Ivan, looking steadily at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was watching Smerdyakov with great curiosity.
<p/>'' You're anathema accursed, as it is,'' Grigory suddenly burst out, <div class="bookquote">``and how dare you argue, you rascal, after that , if--''  (<font color='red'><b>Grigory/Grigory Vassilyevitch</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't scold him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), Grigory, don't scold him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Grigory/Grigory Vassilyevitch</b></font>)</div>Fyodor Pavlovitch cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) short.
<p/>You should wait, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if only a short time, and listen, for I haven't finished all I had to say.
<p/>For at the very moment I become accursed, at that same highest moment, I become exactly like a heathen, and my christening is taken off me and becomes of no avail.
<p/>'' Isn't that so?'' <div class="bookquote">``Make haste and finish, my boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div>Fyodor Pavlovitch urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), sipping from his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) wine-glass with relish. ''
<p/>And if I've ceased to be a Christian, then I told no lie to the enemy when they asked whether I was a Christian or not a Christian, seeing I had already been relieved by God Himself of my Christianity by reason of the thought alone, before I had time to utter a word to the enemy.
<p/>And if I have already been discharged, in what manner and with what sort of justice can I be held responsible as a Christian in the other world for having denied Christ, when, through the very thought alone, before denying Him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) I had been relieved from my christening?
<p/>If I'm no longer a Christian, then I can't renounce Christ, for I've nothing then to renounce. Who will hold an unclean Tatar responsible, Grigory Vassilyevitch, even in heaven, for not having been born a Christian?
<p/>For God Almighty Himself, even if He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) did make the Tatar responsible, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) dies would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) the smallest possible punishment, I imagine -LRB-since he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) must be punished-RRB-, judging that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) is not to blame if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) has come into the world an unclean heathen, from heathen parents.
<p/>And who would punish him (<font color='blue'><b>Tatar</b></font>) for that, considering that you can't take two skins off one ox? The Lord God can't surely take a Tatar and say he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was a Christian?
<p/>That would mean that the Almighty would tell a real untruth. And can the Lord of Heaven and earth tell a lie, even in one word?
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) did not clearly understand what was said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had caught something in this rigmarole, and stood, looking like a man who has just hit his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head against a wall.
<p/>'' Grigory was thunderstruck and looked at the orator, his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) eyes nearly starting out of his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) head. Fyodor Pavlovitch emptied his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) glass and went off into his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) shrill laugh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alyosha! Alyosha! What do you say to that! Ah, you casuist! He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) must have been with the Jesuits, somewhere, Ivan. Oh, you stinking Jesuit, who taught you?
<p/>But you're talking nonsense, you casuist, nonsense, nonsense, nonsense. Don't cry, Grigory, we'll reduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) to smoke and ashes in a moment.
<p/>Tell me this, O ass; you may be right before your enemies, but you have renounced your faith all the same in your own heart, and you say yourself that in that very hour you became anathema accursed.
<p/>And if once you're anathema they won't pat you on the head for it in hell. What do you say to that, my fine Jesuit?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>There is no doubt that I have renounced it in my own heart, but there was no special sin in that.
<p/>'' Or if there was sin, it was the most ordinary.'' <div class="bookquote">``How's that the most ordinary?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You lie, accursed one! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Grigory/Grigory Vassilyevitch</b></font>)</div>hissed Grigory.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>Smerdyakov went on, staid and unruffled, conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Vassilyevitch</b></font>) triumph, but, as it were, generous to the vanquished foe.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch; it is said in the Scripture that if you have faith, even as a mustard seed, and bid a mountain move into the sea, it will move without the least delay at your bidding.
<p/>Well, Grigory Vassilyevitch, if I'm without faith and you have so great a faith that you are continually swearing at me, you try yourself telling this mountain, not to move into the sea for that's a long way off, but even to our stinking little river which runs at the bottom of the garden.
<p/>You'll see for yourself that it won't budge, but will remain just where it is however much you shout at it, and that shows, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that you haven't faith in the proper manner, and only abuse others about it.
<p/>Again, taking into consideration that no one in our day, not only you, but actually no one, from the highest person to the lowest peasant, can shove mountains into the sea--except perhaps some one man in the world, or, at most, two, and they most likely are saving their souls in secret somewhere in the Egyptian desert, so you wouldn't find them--if so it be, if all the rest have no faith, will God curse all the rest?
<p/>that is, the population of the whole earth, except about two hermits in the desert, and in His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) well-known mercy will He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) not forgive one of them?
<p/>And so I'm persuaded that though I may once have doubted I shall be forgiven if I shed tears of repentance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div>cried Fyodor Pavlovitch, in a transport of delight. '' So you do suppose there are two who can move mountains?
<p/>Ivan, make a note of it, write it down. There you have the Russian all over!'' '' You're quite right in saying it's characteristic of the people's faith,'' Ivan assented, with an approving smile.
<p/>'' You agree. Then it must be so, if you agree. It's true, isn't it, Alyosha? That's the Russian faith all over, isn't it?''
<p/>'' No, Smerdyakov has not the Russian faith at all,'' said Alyosha firmly and gravely. '' I'm not talking about his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) faith.
<p/>I mean those two in the desert, only that idea. Surely that's Russian, isn't it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's purely Russian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha smiling.
<p/>'' Your words are worth a gold piece, O ass, and I'll give it to you to-day. But as to the rest you talk nonsense, nonsense, nonsense.
<p/>Let me tell you, stupid, that we here are all of little faith, only from carelessness, because we haven't time; things are too much for us, and, in the second place, the Lord God has given us so little time, only twenty-four hours in the day, so that one hasn't even time to get sleep enough, much less to repent of one's sins.
<p/>While you have denied your faith to your enemies when you'd nothing else to think about but to show your faith!
<p/>So I consider, brother, that it constitutes a sin.'' <div class="bookquote">``Constitute a sin it may, but consider yourself, Grigory Vassilyevitch, that it only extenuates it, if it does constitute.
<p/>If I had believed then in very truth, as I ought to have believed, then it really would have been sinful if I had not faced tortures for my faith, and had gone over to the pagan Mohammedan faith.
<p/>But, of course, it wouldn't have come to torture then, because I should only have had to say at that instant to the mountain, `Move and crush the tormentor,' and it would have moved and at the very instant have crushed him (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) like a black-beetle, and I should have walked away as though nothing had happened, praising and glorifying God.
<p/>But, suppose at that very moment I had tried all that, and cried to that mountain, `Crush these tormentors,' and it hadn't crushed them, how could I have helped doubting, pray, at such a time, and at such a dread hour of mortal terror?
<p/>And apart from that, I should know already that I could not attain to the fullness of the Kingdom of Heaven -LRB-
<p/>for since the mountain had not moved at my word, they could not think very much of my faith up aloft, and there could be no very great reward awaiting me in the world to come-RRB-.
<p/>For, even though they had flayed my skin half off my back, even then the mountain would not have moved at my word or at my cry.
<p/>And at such a moment not only doubt might come over one but one might lose one's reason from fear, so that one would not be able to think at all.
<p/>And, therefore, how should I be particularly to blame if not seeing my advantage or reward there or here, I should, at least, save my skin.
<p/>And so trusting fully in the grace of the Lord I should cherish the hope that I might be altogether forgiven.
<p/>So why should I let them flay the skin off me as well, and to no good purpose? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Chapter VIII.
<p/>Over The Brandy The controversy was over. But, strange to say, Fyodor Pavlovitch, who had been so gay, suddenly began frowning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) frowned and gulped brandy, and it was already a glass too much. <div class="bookquote">``Get along with you, Jesuits! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) cried to the servants.
<p/>'' Go away, Smerdyakov. I'll send you the gold piece I promised you to-day, but be off! Don't cry, Grigory. Go to Marfa.

<p/>That I've always maintained. Our peasants are swindlers, and don't deserve to be pitied, and it's a good thing they're still flogged sometimes.
<p/>Russia is rich in birches. If they destroyed the forests, it would be the ruin of Russia. I stand up for the clever people.
<p/>We've left off thrashing the peasants, we've grown so clever, but they go on thrashing themselves. And a good thing too. '
<p/>For with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again,' or how does it go? Anyhow, it will be measured.
<p/>But Russia's all swinishness. My dear, if you only knew how I hate Russia.... That is, not Russia, but all this vice!

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Really?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Schultz</b></font>) really did. But I respect him (<font color='blue'><b>Schultz</b></font>). There's something of Mephistopheles about him (<font color='blue'><b>Schultz</b></font>), or rather of ' The hero of our time' ...
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>)'s such a sensualist that I should be afraid for my daughter or my wife if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went to confess to him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>).
<p/>The year before last he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) invited us to tea, tea with liqueur -LRB-the ladies send him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) liqueur-RRB-, and began telling us about old times till we nearly split our sides....
<p/>Arbenin, or what's his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) name? ... You see, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>)'s a sensualist. You know, when he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) begins telling stories.... Especially how he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) once cured a paralyzed woman. '
<p/>If my legs were not bad I know a dance I could dance you,' he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) said. What do you say to that? '
<p/>I've plenty of tricks in my time,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) did Dernidov, the merchant, out of sixty thousand.'' <div class="bookquote">``What, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) stole it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) the money as a man he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) could trust, saying, `Take care of it for me, friend, there'll be a police search at my place to-morrow.'
<p/>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) kept it. ' You have given it to the Church,' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) declared. I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>): `You're a scoundrel,' I said. '
<p/>No,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), `I'm not a scoundrel, but I'm broad-minded.' But that wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>), that was some one else. I've muddled him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) with some one else ... without noticing it.
<p/>Come, another glass and that's enough. Take away the bottle, Ivan. I've been telling lies. Why didn't you stop me, Ivan, and tell me I was lying?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I knew you'd stop of yourself.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' That's a lie. You did it from spite, from simple spite against me. You despise me.
<p/>You have come to me and despised me in my own house. '' '' Well, I'm going away. You've had too much brandy.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I've begged you for Christ's sake to go to Tchermashnya for a day or two, and you don't go. ''

<p/>That's why you won't go. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The old man persisted. '' Why are you looking at me? Why do you look like that?
<p/>Your eyes look at me and say, `You ugly drunkard!' Your eyes are mistrustful. They're contemptuous.... You've come here with some design.
<p/>Alyosha, here, looks at me and his (<font color='blue'><b>drunkard</b></font>) eyes shine. Alyosha doesn't despise me. Alexey, you mustn't love Ivan.'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't be ill-tempered with my brother.
<p/>Leave off attacking him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha said emphatically. '' Oh, all right. Ugh, my head aches. Take away the brandy, Ivan. It's the third time I've told you.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) mused, and suddenly a slow, cunning grin spread over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face. '' Don't be angry with a feeble old man, Ivan.
<p/>I know you don't love me, but don't be angry all the same. You've nothing to love me for. You go to Tchermashnya.
<p/>I'll come to you myself and bring you a present. I'll show you a little wench there. I've had my eye on her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) a long time.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s still running about bare-foot. Don't be afraid of bare-footed wenches--don't despise them--they're pearls! '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hand with a smack.
<p/>'' To my thinking,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) revived at once, seeming to grow sober the instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) touched on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) favorite topic. ''
<p/>To my thinking ... Ah, you boys! You children, little sucking-pigs, to my thinking ... I never thought a woman ugly in my life--
<p/>that's been my rule! Can you understand that? How could you understand it? You've milk in your veins, not blood. You're not out of your shells yet.
<p/>My rule has been that you can always find something devilishly interesting in every woman that you wouldn't find in any other.
<p/>Only, one must know how to find it, that's the point! That's a talent! To my mind there are no ugly women.
<p/>Even in vieilles filles , even in them you may discover something that makes you simply wonder that men have been such fools as to let them grow old without noticing them.
<p/>The very fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a woman is half the battle ... but how could you understand that? Bare-footed girls or unattractive ones, you must take by surprise.
<p/>You must astound them till they're fascinated, upset, ashamed that such a gentleman should fall in love with such a little slut.
<p/>It's a jolly good thing that there always are and will be masters and slaves in the world, so there always will be a little maid- of-all-work and her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) master, and you know, that's all that's needed for happiness.
<p/>Didn't you know that? Stay ... listen, Alyosha, I always used to surprise your mother, but in a different way. I paid no attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at all, but
<p/>all at once, when the minute came, I'd be all devotion to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), crawl on my knees, kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) feet, and I always, always--I remember it as though it were to-day--reduced her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to that tinkling, quiet, nervous, queer little laugh.
<p/>The next day she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would begin shrieking hysterically, and this little laugh was not a sign of delight, though it made a very good counterfeit.
<p/>It was peculiar to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) attacks always used to begin like that. That's the great thing, to know how to take every one.
<p/>Once Belyavsky--he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a handsome fellow, and rich--used to like to come here and hang about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--suddenly gave me a slap in the face in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) presence.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--such a mild sheep--why, I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have knocked me down for that blow. How she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) set on me! '
<p/>You're beaten, beaten now,' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. ' You've taken a blow from him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). You have been trying to sell me to him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said... '
<p/>And how dared he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) strike you in my presence! Don't dare come near me again, never, never! Run at once, challenge him (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to a duel!'
<p/>... I took her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to the monastery then to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) senses. The holy Fathers prayed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) back to reason.
<p/>But I swear, by God, Alyosha, I never insulted the poor crazy girl! Only once, perhaps, in the first year; then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was very fond of praying.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) used to keep the feasts of Our Lady particularly and used to turn me out of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) room then. I'll knock that mysticism out of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), thought I! '
<p/>Here,' said I, `you see your holy image. Here it is. Here I take it down. You believe it's miraculous, but here, I'll spit on it directly and nothing will happen to me for it!'...
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) only jumped up, wrung her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands, then suddenly hid her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face in them, began trembling all over and fell on the floor ... fell all of a heap.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw it, good Lord! I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would kill me. Alyosha, Alyosha, what's the matter? '' The old man jumped up in alarm.
<p/>From the time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had begun speaking about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother, a change had gradually come over Alyosha's face. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flushed crimson, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes glowed, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips quivered.
<p/>The old sot had gone spluttering on, noticing nothing, till the moment when something very strange happened to Alyosha. Precisely what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was describing in the crazy woman was suddenly repeated with Alyosha.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jumped up from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seat exactly as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother was said to have done, wrung his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, hid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face in them, and fell back in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair, shaking all over in an hysterical paroxysm of sudden violent, silent weeping.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) extraordinary resemblance to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother particularly impressed the old man. '' Ivan, Ivan! Water, quickly! It's like her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), exactly as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used to be then, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) mother.
<p/>Spurt some water on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) from your mouth, that's what I used to do to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s upset about his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) mother, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) mother,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) muttered to Ivan.
<p/>'' But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was my mother, too, I believe, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) mother. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) not?'' said Ivan, with uncontrolled anger and contempt.
<p/>But something very strange had happened, though only for a second; it seemed really to have escaped the old man's mind that Alyosha's mother actually was the mother of Ivan too.
<p/>The old man shrank before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flashing eyes. '' Your mother? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) muttered, not understanding. '' What do you mean?
<p/>What mother are you talking about? Was she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?... Why, damn it! of course she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was yours too! Damn it! My mind has never been so darkened before.
<p/>At that moment a fearful noise and clamor was heard in the hall, there were violent shouts, the door was flung open, and Dmitri burst into the room.
<p/>Excuse me, why, I was thinking, Ivan.... He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) stopped. A broad, drunken, half-senseless grin overspread his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face. The old man rushed to Ivan in terror.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'ll kill me! He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'ll kill me! Don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) get at me!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) screamed, clinging to the skirt of Ivan's coat.
<p/>They had been struggling with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) in the passage, refusing to admit him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), acting on instructions given them by Fyodor Pavlovitch some days before.
<p/>Taking advantage of the fact that Dmitri stopped a moment on entering the room to look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), Grigory ran round the table, closed the double doors on the opposite side of the room leading to the inner apartments, and stood before the closed doors, stretching wide his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) arms, prepared to defend the entrance, so to speak, with the last drop of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) blood.
<p/>Chapter IX. The Sensualists Grigory and Smerdyakov ran into the room after Dmitri. Seeing this, Dmitri uttered a scream rather than a shout and rushed at Grigory.
<p/>'' Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)'s there! She (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)'s hidden there! Out of the way, scoundrel! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) tried to pull Grigory away, but the old servant pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) back.
<p/>Beside himself with fury, Dmitri struck out, and hit Grigory with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) might. The old man fell like a log, and Dmitri, leaping over him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), broke in the door.
<p/>Smerdyakov remained pale and trembling at the other end of the room, huddling close to Fyodor Pavlovitch. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)'s here!'' shouted Dmitri.
<p/>'' I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) turn towards the house just now, but I couldn't catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>). Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)? Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)?''
<p/>That shout, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)'s here! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div>produced an indescribable effect on Fyodor Pavlovitch. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) terror left him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>)! Hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>)!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) cried, and dashed after Dmitri. Meanwhile Grigory had got up from the floor, but still seemed stunned. Ivan and Alyosha ran after their father.
<p/>In the third room something was heard to fall on the floor with a ringing crash: it was a large glass vase--not an expensive one--on a marble pedestal which Dmitri had upset as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) ran past it.
<p/>'' At him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)!'' shouted the old man. <div class="bookquote">``Help!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan and Alyosha caught the old man and were forcibly bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) back.
<p/>'' Why do you run after him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'ll murder you outright,'' Ivan cried wrathfully at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father. '' Ivan! Alyosha! She (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) must be here.
<p/>Grushenka's here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) himself, running. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was choking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was not expecting Grushenka at the time, and the sudden news that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was here made him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) beside himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was trembling all over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) seemed frantic. '' But you've seen for yourself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) hasn't come,'' cried Ivan. ''
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) may have come by that other entrance. '' <div class="bookquote">``You know that entrance is locked, and you have the key.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dmitri/Dmitri Fyodorovitch/Dmitri Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Dmitri suddenly reappeared in the drawing-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had, of course, found the other entrance locked, and the key actually was in Fyodor Pavlovitch's pocket.
<p/>The windows of all the rooms were also closed, so Grushenka could not have come in anywhere nor have run out anywhere.
<p/>'' Hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>)! '' shrieked Fyodor Pavlovitch, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) again. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>)'s been stealing money in my bedroom.
<p/>But Dmitri threw up both hands and suddenly clutched the old man by the two tufts of hair that remained on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) temples, tugged at them, and flung him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) with a crash on the floor.
<p/>'' And tearing himself from Ivan he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) rushed again at Dmitri. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) kicked him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) two or three times with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) heel in the face.
<p/>The old man moaned shrilly. Ivan, though not so strong as Dmitri, threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) arms round him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), and with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) might pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) away.
<p/>Alyosha helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) slender strength, holding Dmitri in front. <div class="bookquote">``Madman! You've killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Ivan. '' Serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) right!
<p/>'' shouted Dmitri breathlessly. '' If I haven't killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), I'll come again and kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>). You can't protect him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)!'' <div class="bookquote">``Dmitri!
<p/>Go away at once! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Alyosha commandingly. '' Alexey! You tell me. It's only you I can believe; was she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) here just now, or not?
<p/>I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) myself creeping this way by the fence from the lane. I shouted, she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) ran away.'' <div class="bookquote">``I swear she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)'s not been here, and no one expected her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>).... So she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) must ... I'll find out at once where she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) is.... Good-by, Alexey! Not a word to Ćsop about the money now.
<p/>But go to Katerina Ivanovna at once and be sure to say, `He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) sends his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) compliments to you!' Compliments, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) compliments!
<p/>Just compliments and farewell! Describe the scene to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>). '' Meanwhile Ivan and Grigory had raised the old man and seated him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) in an arm-chair.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face was covered with blood, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was conscious and listened greedily to Dmitri's cries. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was still fancying that Grushenka really was somewhere in the house.
<p/>Dmitri looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) with hatred as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) went out. '' I don't repent shedding your blood! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) cried. ''
<p/>Beware, old man, beware of your dream, for I have my dream, too. I curse you, and disown you altogether. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) ran out of the room. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)'s here. She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) must be here. Smerdyakov! Smerdyakov! '' the old man wheezed, scarcely audibly, beckoning to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger.
<p/>'' No, she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>)'s not here, you old lunatic!'' Ivan shouted at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) angrily. '' Here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s fainting! Water! A towel! Make haste, Smerdyakov!''
<p/>Smerdyakov ran for water. At last they got the old man undressed, and put him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to bed. They wrapped a wet towel round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.
<p/>Exhausted by the brandy, by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) violent emotion, and the blows he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had received, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shut his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes and fell asleep as soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head touched the pillow.
<p/>Ivan and Alyosha went back to the drawing-room. Smerdyakov removed the fragments of the broken vase, while Grigory stood by the table looking gloomily at the floor.
<p/>'' Shouldn't you put a wet bandage on your head and go to bed, too?'' Alyosha said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). '' We'll look after him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>My brother gave you a terrible blow--on the head.'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s insulted me!'' Grigory articulated gloomily and distinctly. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s `insulted' his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) father, not only you,'' observed Ivan with a forced smile.
<p/>'' I used to wash him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) tub. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s insulted me,'' repeated Grigory. '' Damn it all, if I hadn't pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) away perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'d have murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>It wouldn't take much to do for Ćsop, would it?'' whispered Ivan to Alyosha. '' God forbid!'' cried Alyosha. '' Why should He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) forbid?
<p/>'' Ivan went on in the same whisper, with a malignant grimace. '' One reptile will devour the other. And serve them both right, too.
<p/>'' Alyosha shuddered. '' Of course I won't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) be murdered as I didn't just now. Stay here, Alyosha, I'll go for a turn in the yard.
<p/>My head's begun to ache. '' Alyosha went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father's bedroom and sat by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) bedside behind the screen for about an hour.
<p/>The old man suddenly opened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes and gazed for a long while at Alyosha, evidently remembering and meditating. All at once his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face betrayed extraordinary excitement.
<p/>'' Alyosha,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whispered apprehensively, <div class="bookquote">``where's Ivan?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' In the yard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s got a headache. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s on the watch.'' <div class="bookquote">``Give me that looking-glass.
<p/>It stands over there. Give it me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) a little round folding looking-glass which stood on the chest of drawers.
<p/>The old man looked at himself in it; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose was considerably swollen, and on the left side of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead there was a rather large crimson bruise.
<p/>'' What does Ivan say? Alyosha, my dear, my only son, I'm afraid of Ivan. I'm more afraid of Ivan than the other.
<p/>You're the only one I'm not afraid of...'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't be afraid of Ivan either. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is angry, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'ll defend you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Alyosha, and what of the other? He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s run to Grushenka. My angel, tell me the truth, was she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) here just now or not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No one has seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). It was a mistake.

<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) delight he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seized Alyosha's hand and pressed it warmly to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart. Tears positively glittered in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes. ''

<p/>Alyosha said sorrowfully. '' No, no, no. I believe you. Eh? What? Can you?'' '' If I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) I'll ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>),'' Alyosha muttered, embarrassed.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Crossing the yard Alyosha found Ivan sitting on the bench at the gateway. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was sitting writing something in pencil in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) note-book.
<p/>Alyosha told Ivan that their father had waked up, was conscious, and had let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) go back to sleep at the monastery.
<p/>'' Alyosha, I should be very glad to meet you to-morrow morning,'' said Ivan cordially, standing up. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) cordiality was a complete surprise to Alyosha.
<p/>I shall be at the Hohlakovs' to-morrow,'' answered Alyosha, <div class="bookquote">``I may be at Katerina Ivanovna's, too, if I don't find her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' But you're going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) now, anyway? For that `compliments and farewell,' '' said Ivan smiling. Alyosha was disconcerted.
<p/>'' I think I quite understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) exclamations just now, and part of what went before. Dmitri has asked you to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) and say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)--well, in fact--takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)?''
<p/>'' Brother, how will all this horror end between father and Dmitri? '' exclaimed Alyosha. '' One can't tell for certain.
<p/>Perhaps in nothing: it may all fizzle out. That woman is a beast. In any case we must keep the old man indoors and not let Dmitri in the house.''
<p/>Brother, let me ask one thing more: has any man a right to look at other men and decide which is worthy to live?
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Why bring in the question of worth? The matter is most often decided in men's hearts on other grounds much more natural.
<p/>And as for rights--who has not the right to wish?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not for another man's death?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What even if for another man's death?
<p/>Why lie to oneself since all men live so and perhaps cannot help living so. Are you referring to what I said just now--that one reptile will devour the other?
<p/>In that case let me ask you, do you think me like Dmitri capable of shedding Ćsop's blood, murdering him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), eh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What are you saying, Ivan? Such an idea never crossed my mind. I don't think Dmitri is capable of it, either.''
<p/>'' Thanks, if only for that,'' smiled Ivan. '' Be sure, I should always defend him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). But in my wishes I reserve myself full latitude in this case.
<p/>Good-by till to-morrow. Don't condemn me, and don't look on me as a villain,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) added with a smile. They shook hands warmly as they had never done before.
<p/>Alyosha felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) brother had taken the first step towards him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) had certainly done this with some definite motive.
<p/>Both Together Alyosha left his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) father's house feeling even more exhausted and dejected in spirit than when he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) had entered it.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) mind too seemed shattered and unhinged, while he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) was afraid to put together the disjointed fragments and form a general idea from all the agonizing and conflicting experiences of the day.
<p/>Towering like a mountain above all the rest stood the fatal, insoluble question: How would things end between his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) brother Dmitri with this terrible woman?
<p/>Chapter X. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) felt something bordering upon despair, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had never known till then. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had himself been a witness of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had been present and seen them face to face.
<p/>Yet only his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) brother Dmitri could be made unhappy, terribly, completely unhappy: there was trouble awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>). It appeared too that there were other people concerned, far more so than Alyosha could have supposed before.
<p/>There was something positively mysterious in it, too. Ivan had made a step towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), which was what Alyosha had been long desiring.
<p/>Strange to say, that morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had set out for Katerina Ivanovna's in the greatest embarrassment; now he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) felt nothing of the kind.
<p/>Yet now he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) felt for some reason that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was frightened at it. And these women? On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was hastening there as though expecting to find guidance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>The matter of the three thousand was decided irrevocably, and Dmitri, feeling himself dishonored and losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) last hope, might sink to any depth.
<p/>Yet to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) this message was obviously more difficult than before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had, moreover, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) to describe to Katerina Ivanovna the scene which had just taken place with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) father.
<p/>It was by now seven o'clock, and it was getting dark as Alyosha entered the very spacious and convenient house in the High Street occupied by Katerina Ivanovna.
<p/>One of them, a woman of little education, was that aunt of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) half-sister Agafya Ivanovna who had looked after her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) father's house when she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) came from boarding-school.
<p/>Alyosha knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) lived with two aunts. The other aunt was a Moscow lady of style and consequence, though in straitened circumstances.
<p/>It was said that they both gave way in everything to Katerina Ivanovna, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) only kept them with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) as chaperons.
<p/>but her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) benefactress, the general's widow, who had been kept by illness in Moscow, and to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was obliged to write twice a week a full account of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) doings.
<p/>When Alyosha entered the hall and asked the maid who opened the door to him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) to take his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) name up, it was evident that they were already aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) arrival.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna herself gave way to no one Possibly he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) had been noticed from the window. At least, Alyosha heard a noise, caught the sound of flying footsteps and rustling skirts.
<p/>Two or three women, perhaps, had run out of the room. Alyosha thought it strange that his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) arrival should cause such excitement.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) was conducted however to the drawing-room at once. It was a large room, elegantly and amply furnished, not at all in provincial style.
<p/>There were pictures on the walls, vases and lamps on the tables, masses of flowers, and even an aquarium in the window.
<p/>Alyosha made out a silk mantle thrown down on the sofa, where people had evidently just been sitting; and on a table in front of the sofa were two unfinished cups of chocolate, cakes, a glass saucer with blue raisins, and another with sweetmeats.
<p/>There were many sofas, lounges, settees, big and little tables. It was twilight and rather dark. Alyosha saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>masses</b></font>) had interrupted visitors, and frowned.
<p/>But at that instant the portičre was raised, and with rapid, hurrying footsteps Katerina Ivanovna came in, holding out both hands to Alyosha with a radiant smile of delight.
<p/>At the same instant a servant brought in two lighted candles and set them on the table. <div class="bookquote">``Thank God! At last you have come too!
<p/>Alyosha had been struck by Katerina Ivanovna's beauty when, three weeks before, Dmitri had first brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), at Katerina Ivanovna's special request, to be introduced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>I've been simply praying for you all day! Sit down. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There had been no conversation between them at that interview, however.
<p/>Supposing Alyosha to be very shy, Katerina Ivanovna had talked all the time to Dmitri to spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>). Alyosha had been silent, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had seen a great deal very clearly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was struck by the imperiousness, proud ease, and self-confidence of the haughty girl. And all that was certain, Alyosha felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was not exaggerating it.
<p/>But in those eyes and in the lines of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) exquisite lips there was something with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) brother might well be passionately in love, but which perhaps could not be loved for long.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) expressed this thought almost plainly to Dmitri when, after the visit, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) brother besought and insisted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) should not conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) impressions on seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) betrothed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) great glowing black eyes were very fine, especially with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pale, even rather sallow, longish face. '' You'll be happy with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), but perhaps--not tranquilly happy.''
<p/>'' Quite so, brother. Such people remain always the same. They don't yield to fate. So you think I shan't love her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for ever.
<p/>Alyosha had given his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) opinion at the time, blushing, and angry with himself for having yielded to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) brother's entreaties and put such <div class="bookquote">``foolish''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>ideas into words.
<p/>'' '' No; perhaps you will love her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for ever. But perhaps you won't always be happy with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). '' For his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) opinion had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as awfully foolish immediately after he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had uttered it.
<p/>It was with the more amazement that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) felt now, at the first glance at Katerina Ivanovna as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) ran in to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had perhaps been utterly mistaken.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) felt ashamed too of having given so confident an opinion about a woman. This time her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face was beaming with spontaneous good-natured kindliness, and direct warm-hearted sincerity.
<p/>The <div class="bookquote">``pride and haughtiness,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>which had struck Alyosha so much before, was only betrayed now in a frank, generous energy and a sort of bright, strong faith in herself.
<p/>Alyosha realized at the first glance, at the first word, that all the tragedy of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) position in relation to the man she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) loved so dearly was no secret to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) perhaps already knew everything, positively everything.
<p/>And yet, in spite of that, there was such brightness in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, such faith in the future. Alyosha felt at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gravely wronged her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts.
<p/>Besides all this, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) noticed at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) first words that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was in great excitement, an excitement perhaps quite exceptional and almost approaching ecstasy.
<p/>I was so eager to see you, because I can learn from you the whole truth--from you and no one else.''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was conquered and captivated immediately. '' <div class="bookquote">``I have come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>muttered Alyosha confusedly, <div class="bookquote">``I--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sent me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sent you! I foresaw that.
<p/>Now I know everything--everything! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Katerina</b></font>)</div>cried Katerina Ivanovna, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eyes flashing. '' Wait a moment, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I'll tell you why I've been so longing to see you.
<p/>You see, I know perhaps far more than you do yourself, and there's no need for you to tell me anything.
<p/>I want you to tell me most directly, plainly, coarsely even -LRB-oh, as coarsely as you like!-RRB-, what you thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) just now and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) position after your meeting with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) to-day.
<p/>That will perhaps be better than if I had a personal explanation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) does not want to come to me.
<p/>I'll tell you what I want from you. I want to know your own last impression of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>). Do you understand what I want from you?
<p/>Now, tell me simply, tell me every word of the message he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) sent you with -LRB-I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) would send you-RRB-.''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) told me to give you his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) compliments--and to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) would never come again--but to give you his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) compliments.
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) compliments? Was that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) said--his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) own expression?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Accidentally perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) made a mistake in the word, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) did not use the right word?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) told me precisely to repeat that word. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) begged me two or three times not to forget to say so.
<p/>'' Katerina Ivanovna flushed hotly. <div class="bookquote">``Help me now, Alexey Fyodorovitch. Now I really need your help. I'll tell you what I think, and you must simply say whether it's right or not.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had sent me his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) compliments in passing, without insisting on your repeating the words, without emphasizing them, that would be the end of everything!
<p/>But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) particularly insisted on those words, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) particularly told you not to forget to repeat them to me, then perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was in excitement, beside himself.
<p/>Listen! He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) decision and was frightened at it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) wasn't walking away from me with a resolute step, but leaping headlong.
<p/>The emphasis on that phrase may have been simply bravado.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, yes!'' cried Alyosha warmly. '' I believe that is it.''
<p/>'' And, if so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'s not altogether lost. I can still save him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>). Stay! Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) not tell you anything about money--about three thousand roubles?''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) honor and that nothing matters now,'' Alyosha answered warmly, feeling a rush of hope in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) heart and believing that there really might be a way of escape and salvation for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) brother.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) did speak about it, and it's that more than anything that's crushing him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>). '' But do you know about the money?
<p/>I've known of it a long time; I telegraphed to Moscow to inquire, and heard long ago that the money had not arrived.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) added, and suddenly broke off. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) hadn't sent the money, but I said nothing. Last week I learnt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was still in need of money.
<p/>My only object in all this was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) should know to whom to turn, and who was his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) true friend.
<p/>No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) won't recognize that I am his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) truest friend; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) won't know me, and looks on me merely as a woman.
<p/>I've been tormented all the week, trying to think how to prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) from being ashamed to face me because he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) spent that three thousand.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) feel ashamed of himself, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) be ashamed of other people's knowing, but not of my knowing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) can tell God everything without shame.
<p/>Why is it he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) still does not understand how much I am ready to bear for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) sake? Why, why doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) know me?
<p/>How dare he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) not know me after all that has happened? I want to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) for ever. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) forget me as his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) betrothed.
<p/>And here he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) fears that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is dishonored in my eyes. Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) wasn't afraid to be open with you, Alexey Fyodorovitch.
<p/>How is it that I don't deserve the same? '' The last words she (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) uttered in tears. Tears gushed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' I must tell you,'' Alyosha began, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) voice trembling too, <div class="bookquote">``what happened just now between him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) and my father. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) described the whole scene, how Dmitri had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) to get the money, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had broken in, knocked his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) father down, and after that had again specially and emphatically begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) compliments and farewell.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) went to that woman,'' Alyosha added softly. '' And do you suppose that I can't put up with that woman?
<p/>Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) think I can't? But he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) won't marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suddenly laughed nervously. '' Could such a passion last for ever in a Karamazov?
<p/>It's passion, not love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) won't marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) won't marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>). '' Again Katerina Ivanovna laughed strangely. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) may marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>),'' said Alyosha mournfully, looking down.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) won't marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), I tell you. That girl is an angel. Do you know that? Do you know that?
<p/>'' Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed suddenly with extraordinary warmth. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is one of the most fantastic of fantastic creatures. I know how bewitching she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is, but I know too that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is kind, firm and noble.
<p/>Why do you look at me like that, Alexey Fyodorovitch? Perhaps you are wondering at my words, perhaps you don't believe me?
<p/>Agrafena Alexandrovna, my angel!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) cried suddenly to some one, peeping into the next room, ``come in to us. This is a friend.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've only been waiting behind the curtain for you to call me,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a soft, one might even say sugary, feminine voice.
<p/>This is Alyosha. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knows all about our affairs. Show yourself to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). '' The portičre was raised and Grushenka herself, smiling and beaming, came up to the table.
<p/>A violent revulsion passed over Alyosha. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) and could not take them off. Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was, that awful woman, the <div class="bookquote">``beast,''  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>as Ivan had called her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) half an hour before.
<p/>And yet one would have thought the creature standing before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) most simple and ordinary, a good-natured, kind woman, handsome certainly, but
<p/>so like other handsome ordinary women! It is true she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was very, very good-looking with that Russian beauty so passionately loved by many men.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a rather tall woman, though a little shorter than Katerina Ivanovna, who was exceptionally tall. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had a full figure, with soft, as it were, noiseless, movements, softened to a peculiar over-sweetness, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) voice.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) moved, not like Katerina Ivanovna, with a vigorous, bold step, but noiselessly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) feet made absolutely no sound on the floor.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sank softly into a low chair, softly rustling her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sumptuous black silk dress, and delicately nestling her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) milk-white neck and broad shoulders in a costly cashmere shawl.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was twenty-two years old, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) face looked exactly that age. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was very white in the face, with a pale pink tint on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) cheeks.
<p/>The modeling of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) face might be said to be too broad, and the lower jaw was set a trifle forward.
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) magnificent, abundant dark brown hair, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sable-colored eyebrows and charming gray-blue eyes with their long lashes would have made the most indifferent person, meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) casually in a crowd in the street, stop at the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) face and remember it long after.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) upper lip was thin, but the slightly prominent lower lip was at least twice as full, and looked pouting. What struck Alyosha most in that face was its expression of childlike good nature.
<p/>There was a childlike look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eyes, a look of childish delight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) came up to the table, beaming with delight and seeming to expect something with childish, impatient, and confiding curiosity.
<p/>There was something else in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) could not understand, or would not have been able to define, and which yet perhaps unconsciously affected him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>).
<p/>The light in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eyes gladdened the soul--Alyosha felt that. It was that softness, that voluptuousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) bodily movements, that catlike noiselessness.
<p/>Yet it was a vigorous, ample body. Under the shawl could be seen full broad shoulders, a high, still quite girlish bosom.
<p/>Connoisseurs of Russian beauty could have foretold with certainty that this fresh, still youthful beauty would lose its harmony by the age of thirty, would <div class="bookquote">``spread'' (<font color='red'><b>Russian</b></font>)</div>; that the face would become puffy, and that wrinkles would very soon appear upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) forehead and round the eyes; the complexion would grow coarse and red perhaps--in fact, that it was the beauty of the moment, the fleeting beauty which is so often met with in Russian women.
<p/>Alyosha, of course, did not think of this; but though he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) was fascinated, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) wondered with an unpleasant sensation, and as it were regretfully, why she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) drawled in that way and could not speak naturally.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) figure suggested the lines of the Venus of Milo, though already in somewhat exaggerated proportions. That could be divined. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) did so evidently feeling there was a charm in the exaggerated, honeyed modulation of the syllables.
<p/>And yet this intonation and manner of speaking impressed Alyosha as almost incredibly incongruous with the childishly simple and happy expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) face, the soft, babyish joy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna at once made her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sit down in an arm- chair facing Alyosha, and ecstatically kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) several times on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) smiling lips.
<p/>It was, of course, only a bad, underbred habit that showed bad education and a false idea of good manners. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) seemed quite in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>'' This is the first time we've met, Alexey Fyodorovitch,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said rapturously. '' I wanted to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>I wanted to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), but I'd no sooner expressed the wish than she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) came to me. I knew we should settle everything together--everything.
<p/>I was begged not to take the step, but I foresaw it would be a way out of the difficulty, and I was not mistaken.
<p/>My heart told me so-- Grushenka has explained everything to me, told me all she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) means to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) flew here like an angel of goodness and brought us peace and joy.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not disdain me, sweet, excellent young lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>drawled Grushenka in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sing-song voice, still with the same charming smile of delight.
<p/>'' Don't dare to speak to me like that, you sorceress, you witch! Disdain you! Here, I must kiss your lower lip once more.
<p/>It looks as though it were swollen, and now it will be more so, and more and more. Look how she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) laughs, Alexey Fyodorovitch!
<p/>It does one's heart good to see the angel.'' Alyosha flushed, and faint, imperceptible shivers kept running down him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>). '' You make so much of me, dear young lady, and perhaps I am not at all worthy of your kindness.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Not worthy! She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s not worthy of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Katerina</b></font>)</div>Katerina Ivanovna cried again with the same warmth. '' You know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, we're fanciful, we're self-willed, but proudest of the proud in our little heart.
<p/>We're noble, we're generous, Alexey Fyodorovitch, let me tell you. We have only been unfortunate. We were too ready to make every sacrifice for an unworthy, perhaps, or fickle man.
<p/>There was one man--one, an officer too, we loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), we sacrificed everything to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). That was long ago, five years ago, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has forgotten us, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has married.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a widower, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has written, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is coming here, and, do you know, we've loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), none but him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), all this time, and we've loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) all our life!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will come, and Grushenka will be happy again. For the last five years she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s been wretched. But who can reproach her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), who can boast of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) favor?
<p/>Only that bedridden old merchant, but he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) is more like her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend, her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) protector. He (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then in despair, in agony, deserted by the man she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was ready to drown herself then, but the old merchant saved her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--saved her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!'' <div class="bookquote">``You defend me very kindly, dear young lady.
<p/>You are in a great hurry about everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>Grushenka drawled again. <div class="bookquote">``Defend you! Is it for me to defend you? Should I dare to defend you?
<p/>It has brought me happiness and has lifted me up, and I'm going to kiss it, outside and inside, here, here, here!
<p/>Grushenka, angel, give me your hand. Look at that charming soft little hand, Alexey Fyodorovitch! Look at it! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And three times she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) kissed the certainly charming, though rather fat, hand of Grushenka in a sort of rapture.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand with a charming musical, nervous little laugh, watched the <div class="bookquote">``sweet young lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and obviously liked having her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand kissed.
<p/>'' Perhaps there's rather too much rapture,'' thought Alyosha. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) blushed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) felt a peculiar uneasiness at heart the whole time.
<p/>'' You won't make me blush, dear young lady, kissing my hand like this before Alexey Fyodorovitch. '' <div class="bookquote">``Do you think I meant to make you blush?''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Katerina</b></font>)</div>said Katerina Ivanovna, somewhat surprised.
<p/>'' Ah, my dear, how little you understand me!'' '' Yes, and you too perhaps quite misunderstand me, dear young lady.
<p/>Maybe I'm not so good as I seem to you. I've a bad heart; I will have my own way. I fascinated poor Dmitri Fyodorovitch that day simply for fun.''
<p/>'' But now you'll save him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>). You've given me your word. You'll explain it all to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>). You'll break to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) that you have long loved another man, who is now offering you his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.''
<p/>'' Oh, no! I didn't give you my word to do that. It was you kept talking about that. I didn't give you my word.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then I didn't quite understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Katerina</b></font>)</div>said Katerina Ivanovna slowly, turning a little pale. '' You promised--'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, no, angel lady, I've promised nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>Grushenka interrupted softly and evenly, still with the same gay and simple expression.
<p/>'' You see at once, dear young lady, what a willful wretch I am compared with you. If I want to do a thing I do it.
<p/>I may have made you some promise just now. But now again I'm thinking: I may take to Mitya again. I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) very much once--liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) for almost a whole hour.
<p/>Now maybe I shall go and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to stay with me from this day forward. You see, I'm so changeable.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just now you said--something quite different,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Katerina</b></font>)</div>Katerina Ivanovna whispered faintly. '' Ah, just now! But, you know. I'm such a soft-hearted, silly creature.
<p/>Only think what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s gone through on my account! What if when I go home I feel sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)? What then?''
<p/>'' I never expected-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, young lady, how good and generous you are compared with me! Now perhaps you won't care for a silly creature like me, now you know my character.
<p/>Give me your sweet little hand, angelic lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said tenderly, and with a sort of reverence took Katerina Ivanovna's hand.
<p/>'' Here, dear young lady, I'll take your hand and kiss it as you did mine. You kissed mine three times, but I ought to kiss yours three hundred times to be even with you.
<p/>Well, but let that pass. And then it shall be as God wills. Perhaps I shall be your slave entirely and want to do your bidding like a slave.
<p/>Let it be as God wills, without any agreements and promises. What a sweet hand--what a sweet hand you have! You sweet young lady, you incredible beauty!
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) slowly raised the hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lips, with the strange object indeed of <div class="bookquote">``being even''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in kisses.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) listened with timid hope to the last words, though Grushenka's promise to do her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bidding like a slave was very strangely expressed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked intently into her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) still saw in those eyes the same simple-hearted, confiding expression, the same bright gayety.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna did not take her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hand away. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'s perhaps too naďve,'' thought Katerina Ivanovna, with a gleam of hope.
<p/>Grushenka meanwhile seemed enthusiastic over the <div class="bookquote">``sweet hand. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) raised it deliberately to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) lips. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) held it for two or three minutes near her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) lips, as though reconsidering something.
<p/>'' Do you know, angel lady,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) suddenly drawled in an even more soft and sugary voice, <div class="bookquote">``do you know, after all, I think I won't kiss your hand?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) laughed a little merry laugh. '' As you please. What's the matter with you?'' said Katerina Ivanovna, starting suddenly.
<p/>'' So that you may be left to remember that you kissed my hand, but I didn't kiss yours. '' There was a sudden gleam in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) looked with awful intentness at Katerina Ivanovna. '' Insolent creature!'' cried Katerina Ivanovna, as though suddenly grasping something. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) flushed all over and leapt up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) seat.
<p/>Grushenka too got up, but without haste. '' So I shall tell Mitya how you kissed my hand, but I didn't kiss yours at all.
<p/>And how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) will laugh!'' <div class="bookquote">``Vile slut! Go away!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, for shame, young lady! Ah, for shame! That's unbecoming for you, dear young lady,
<p/>a word like that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go away! You're a creature for sale!''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Katerina</b></font>)</div>screamed Katerina Ivanovna. Every feature was working in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) utterly distorted face.
<p/>'' For sale indeed! You used to visit gentlemen in the dusk for money once; you brought your beauty for sale.
<p/>You see, I know. '' Katerina Ivanovna shrieked, and would have rushed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), but Alyosha held her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) strength.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a step, not a word! Don't speak, don't answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).

''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Katerina</b></font>)</div>At that instant Katerina Ivanovna's two aunts ran in at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) cry, and with them a maid-servant.
<p/>All hurried to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>). '' I will go away,'' said Grushenka, taking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) mantle from the sofa. '' Alyosha, darling, see me home!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go away--go away, make haste! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Alyosha, clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hands imploringly. '' Dear little Alyosha, see me home! I've got a pretty little story to tell you on the way.
<p/>I got up this scene for your benefit, Alyosha. See me home, dear, you'll be glad of it afterwards. '' Alyosha turned away, wringing his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Grushenka ran out of the house, laughing musically. Katerina Ivanovna went into a fit of hysterics. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sobbed, and was shaken with convulsions.
<p/>Every one fussed round her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>). '' I warned you,'' said the elder of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) aunts. '' I tried to prevent your doing this.
<p/>You're too impulsive. How could you do such a thing? You don't know these creatures, and they say she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'s worse than any of them.
<p/>You are too self-willed.'' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'s a tigress! '' yelled Katerina Ivanovna. '' Why did you hold me, Alexey Fyodorovitch? I'd have beaten her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)--beaten her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)!
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) could not control herself before Alyosha; perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) did not care to, indeed. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) ought to be flogged in public on a scaffold!''
<p/>Alyosha withdrew towards the door. '' But, my God!'' cried Katerina Ivanovna, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hands. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could be so dishonorable, so inhuman!
<p/>Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) told that creature what happened on that fatal, accursed day! ' You brought your beauty for sale, dear young lady.'
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knows it! Your brother's a scoundrel, Alexey Fyodorovitch. '' Alyosha wanted to say something, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) couldn't find a word.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) heart ached. '' Go away, Alexey Fyodorovitch! It's shameful , it's awful for me! To- morrow, I beg you on my knees, come to-morrow.
<p/>Don't condemn me. Forgive me. I don't know what I shall do with myself now!'' Alyosha walked out into the street reeling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) could have wept as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was overtaken by the maid. '' The young lady forgot to give you this letter from Madame Hohlakov; it's been left with us since dinner-time.
<p/>'' Alyosha took the little pink envelope mechanically and put it, almost unconsciously, into his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) pocket. Chapter XI. Another Reputation Ruined
<p/>It was not much more than three-quarters of a mile from the town to the monastery. Alyosha walked quickly along the road, at that hour deserted.
<p/>It was almost night, and too dark to see anything clearly at thirty paces ahead. There were cross-roads half-way. A figure came into sight under a solitary willow at the cross-roads.
<p/>As soon as Alyosha reached the cross- roads the figure moved out and rushed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), shouting savagely: <div class="bookquote">``Your money or your life!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' So it's you, Mitya,'' cried Alyosha, in surprise, violently startled however. '' Ha ha ha! You didn't expect me? I wondered where to wait for you.
<p/>By her (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) house? There are three ways from it, and I might have missed you. At last I thought of waiting here, for you had to pass here
<p/>, there's no other way to the monastery. Come, tell me the truth. Crush me like a beetle. But what's the matter?''
<p/>-LRB-Alyosha began to cry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had been on the verge of tears for a long time, and now something seemed to snap in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) soul.-RRB-
<p/>'' Nothing, brother--it's the fright you gave me. Oh, Dmitri! Father's blood just now. '' '' You almost killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)--cursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)--and now--here--you're making jokes--`Your money or your life!'
<p/>'' '' Well, what of that? It's not seemly--is that it? Not suitable in my position?'' '' No--I only--'' <div class="bookquote">``Stay. Look at the night.
<p/>You see what a dark night, what clouds, what a wind has risen. I hid here under the willow waiting for you.
<p/>Here I have a willow, a handkerchief, a shirt, I can twist them into a rope in a minute, and braces besides, and why go on burdening the earth, dishonoring it with my vile presence?
<p/>And as God's above, I suddenly thought, why go on in misery any longer, what is there to wait for? And then I heard you coming--
<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is, that man, my dear little brother, whom I love more than any one in the world, the only one I love in the world.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) can't be said to have told it fluently and consecutively, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) seemed to make it clear, not omitting any word or action of significance, and vividly describing, often in one word, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) own sensations.
<p/>Dmitri listened in silence, gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) with a terrible fixed stare, but it was clear to Alyosha that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) understood it all, and had grasped every point.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) scowled, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) teeth, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) fixed stare became still more rigid, more concentrated, more terrible, when suddenly, with incredible rapidity, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) wrathful, savage face changed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) tightly compressed lips parted, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch broke into uncontrolled, spontaneous laughter.
<p/>But as the story went on, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) face became not merely gloomy, but menacing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) literally shook with laughter. For a long time he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) could not speak.
<p/>'' So she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wouldn't kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hand! So she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) didn't kiss it; so she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ran away! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) kept exclaiming with hysterical delight; insolent delight it might have been called, if it had not been so spontaneous.
<p/>'' So the other one called her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) tigress! And a tigress she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is! So she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ought to be flogged on a scaffold?
<p/>Yes, yes, so she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ought. That's just what I think; she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ought to have been long ago. It's like this, brother, let her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) be punished, but I must get better first.

<p/>But the pride, the recklessness, the defiance of fate, the unbounded defiance! You say that aunt tried to stop her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)? That aunt, you know, is overbearing, herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)'s the sister of the general's widow in Moscow, and even more stuck-up than she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). But her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) husband was caught stealing government money.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lost everything, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) estate and all, and the proud wife had to lower her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) colors, and hasn't raised them since.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tried to prevent Katya, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wouldn't listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) can overcome everything, that everything will give way to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could bewitch Grushenka if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) liked, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) believed it herself : she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) plays a part to herself, and whose fault is it?
<p/>No, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) really was fascinated by Grushenka, that's to say, not by Grushenka, but by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own dream, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own delusion--because it was her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dream, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) delusion!
<p/>Do you think she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) kissed Grushenka's hand first, on purpose, with a motive? Alyosha, darling, how did you escape from them, those women?
<p/>Did you pick up your cassock and run? Ha ha ha!'' '' Brother, you don't seem to have noticed how you've insulted Katerina Ivanovna by telling Grushenka about that day.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) flung it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) face just now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had gone to gentlemen in secret to sell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) beauty!
<p/>Brother, what could be worse than that insult? '' What worried Alyosha more than anything was that, incredible as it seemed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) brother appeared pleased at Katerina Ivanovna's humiliation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) only now realized it, though Alyosha had just told him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) of the insult, and Katerina Ivanovna's cry: <div class="bookquote">``Your brother is a scoundrel!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Katerina</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Bah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dmitri/Dmitri Fyodorovitch/Dmitri Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Dmitri frowned fiercely, and struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) forehead with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, perhaps, I really did tell Grushenka about that `fatal day,' as Katya calls it.
<p/>Yes, I did tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>), I remember! It was that time at Mokroe. I was drunk, the gypsies were singing.... But I was sobbing.
<p/>I was sobbing then, kneeling and praying to Katya's image, and Grushenka understood it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) understood it all then. I remember, she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) cried herself....
<p/>Damn it all! But it's bound to be so now.... Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) cried, but now `the dagger in the heart'! That's how women are.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) looked down and sank into thought. '' Yes, I am a scoundrel, a thorough scoundrel! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) said suddenly, in a gloomy voice.
<p/>'' It doesn't matter whether I cried or not, I'm a scoundrel! Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) I accept the name, if that's any comfort.
<p/>Come, that's enough. Good-by. It's no use talking! It's not amusing. You go your way and I mine. And I don't want to see you again except as a last resource.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) warmly pressed Alyosha's hand, and still looking down, without raising his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) head, as though tearing himself away, turned rapidly towards the town.
<p/>Good- by, Alexey!'' Alyosha looked after him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>), unable to believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) would go away so abruptly. '' Stay, Alexey, one more confession to you alone!
<p/>'' cried Dmitri, suddenly turning back. '' Look at me. Look at me well. You see here, here--there's terrible disgrace in store for me.
<p/>-LRB-As he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Dmitri struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) chest with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) fist with a strange air, as though the dishonor lay precisely on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) chest, in some spot, in a pocket, perhaps, or hanging round his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) neck.-RRB-
<p/>You know me now, a scoundrel, an avowed scoundrel, but let me tell you that I've never done anything before and never shall again, anything that can compare in baseness with the dishonor which I bear now at this very minute on my breast, here, here, which will come to pass, though I'm perfectly free to stop it.
<p/>'' '' I can stop it or carry it through, note that. Well, let me tell you, I shall carry it through.
<p/>I told you everything just now, but I didn't tell you this, because even I had not brass enough for it.
<p/>I shan't stop it. I can still pull up; if I do, I can give back the full half of my lost honor to-morrow.
<p/>But I shan't pull up. I shall carry out my base plan, and you can bear witness that I told you so beforehand.
<p/>Darkness and destruction! No need to explain. You'll find out in due time. The filthy back-alley and the she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)- devil. Good-by.
<p/>Don't pray for me, I'm not worth it. And there's no need, no need at all.... I don't need it! Away!
<p/>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) suddenly retreated, this time finally. Alyosha went towards the monastery. '' What? I shall never see him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) again!
<p/>What is he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) saying? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) wondered wildly. '' Why, I shall certainly see him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) to-morrow. I shall look him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) up.
<p/>I shall make a point of it. What does he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) mean?'' ------------------------------------- He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) went round the monastery, and crossed the pine-wood to the hermitage.
<p/>The door was opened to him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), though no one was admitted at that hour. There was a tremor in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) heart as he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) went into Father Zossima's cell.
<p/>'' Why, why, had he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) gone forth? Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) into the world? Here was peace. Here was holiness.
<p/>But there was confusion, there was darkness in which one lost one's way and went astray at once... '' In the cell he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) found the novice Porfiry and Father Paďssy, who came every hour to inquire after Father Zossima.
<p/>Alyosha learnt with alarm that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) was getting worse and worse. Even his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) usual discourse with the brothers could not take place that day.
<p/>As a rule every evening after service the monks flocked into Father Zossima's cell, and all confessed aloud their sins of the day, their sinful thoughts and temptations; even their disputes, if there had been any.
<p/>It was against this general <div class="bookquote">``confession''  (<font color='red'><b>the opponents</b></font>)</div>that the opponents of <div class="bookquote">``elders''  (<font color='red'><b>the opponents</b></font>)</div>protested, maintaining that it was a profanation of the sacrament of confession, almost a sacrilege, though this was quite a different thing.
<p/>They even represented to the diocesan authorities that such confessions attained no good object, but actually to a large extent led to sin and temptation.
<p/>Many of the brothers disliked going to the elder, and went against their own will because every one went, and for fear they should be accused of pride and rebellious ideas.
<p/>People said that some of the monks agreed beforehand, saying, <div class="bookquote">``I'll confess I lost my temper with you this morning, and you confirm it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the monks</b></font>)</div>simply in order to have something to say.
<p/>Some confessed kneeling. The elder absolved, reconciled, exhorted, imposed penance, blessed, and dismissed them. Alyosha knew that this actually happened sometimes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) knew, too, that there were among the monks some who deeply resented the fact that letters from relations were habitually taken to the elder, to be opened and read by him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) before those to whom they were addressed.
<p/>It was assumed, of course, that all this was done freely, and in good faith, by way of voluntary submission and salutary guidance.
<p/>Yet the older and more experienced of the monks adhered to their opinion, arguing that <div class="bookquote">``for those who have come within these walls sincerely seeking salvation, such obedience and sacrifice will certainly be salutary and of great benefit; those, on the other hand, who find it irksome, and repine, are no true monks, and have made a mistake in entering the monastery--their proper place is in the world.
<p/>But, in fact, there was sometimes no little insincerity, and much that was false and strained in this practice. Even in the temple one cannot be safe from sin and the devil.
<p/>So it was no good taking it too much into account.''  (<font color='red'><b>the monks</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) is weaker, a drowsiness has come over him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>),'' Father Paďssy whispered to Alyosha, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) blessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>).
<p/>'' It's difficult to rouse him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>). And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) must not be roused. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) waked up for five minutes, sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) blessing to the brothers, and begged their prayers for him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) at night.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) intends to take the sacrament again in the morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) remembered you, Alexey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) asked whether you had gone away, and was told that you were in the town. '
<p/>I blessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) for that work,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) said, `his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) place is there, not here, for awhile.' Those were his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) words about you.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) remembered you lovingly, with anxiety; do you understand how he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) honored you? But how is it that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) has decided that you shall spend some time in the world?
<p/>Understand, Alexey, that if you return to the world, it must be to do the duty laid upon you by your elder, and not for frivolous vanity and worldly pleasures.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) must have foreseen something in your destiny! '' Father Paďssy went out. Alyosha had no doubt that Father Zossima was dying, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) might live another day or two.
<p/>Alyosha firmly and ardently resolved that in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) promises to his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) father, the Hohlakovs, and Katerina Ivanovna, he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) would not leave the monastery next day, but would remain with his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) elder to the end.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) heart glowed with love, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) reproached himself bitterly for having been able for one instant to forget him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) had left in the monastery on his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) deathbed, and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) honored above every one in the world.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) went into Father Zossima's bedroom, knelt down, and bowed to the ground before the elder, who slept quietly without stirring, with regular, hardly audible breathing and a peaceful face.
<p/>Taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) boots, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) lay down on the hard, narrow, leathern sofa, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had long used as a bed, bringing nothing but a pillow.
<p/>Alyosha returned to the other room, where Father Zossima had received his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) guests in the morning. The mattress, about which his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) father had shouted to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had long forgotten to lie on.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cassock, which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) used as a covering. But before going to bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knees and prayed a long time.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fervent prayer he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not beseech God to lighten his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) darkness but only thirsted for the joyous emotion, which always visited his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul after the praise and adoration, of which his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) evening prayer usually consisted.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was praying, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) suddenly felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pocket the little pink note the servant had handed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) left Katerina Ivanovna's.
<p/>That joy always brought him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) light untroubled sleep. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was disturbed, but finished his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) prayer. Then, after some hesitation, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) opened the envelope.
<p/>In it was a letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), signed by Lise, the young daughter of Madame Hohlakov, who had laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) before the elder in the morning.
<p/>Alexey Fyodorovitch,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) wrote, <div class="bookquote">``I am writing to you without any one's knowledge, even mamma's, and I know how wrong it is.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But I cannot live without telling you the feeling that has sprung up in my heart, and this no one
<p/>but us two must know for a time. But how am I to say what I want so much to tell you?
<p/>Paper, they say, does not blush, but I assure you it's not true and that it's blushing just as I am now, all over.
<p/>Dear Alyosha, I love you, I've loved you from my childhood, since our Moscow days, when you were very different from what you are now, and I shall love you all my life.
<p/>My heart has chosen you, to unite our lives, and pass them together till our old age. Of course, on condition that you will leave the monastery.
<p/>As for our age we will wait for the time fixed by the law. By that time I shall certainly be quite strong, I shall be walking and dancing.
<p/>There can be no doubt of that. '' You see how I've thought of everything. There's only one thing I can't imagine: what you'll think of me when you read this.
<p/>I made you angry this morning, but I assure you before I took up my pen, I prayed before the Image of the Mother of God, and now I'm praying, and almost crying.
<p/>I'm always laughing and being naughty. '' My secret is in your hands. When you come to-morrow, I don't know how I shall look at you.
<p/>Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, what if I can't restrain myself like a silly and laugh when I look at you as I did to-day.
<p/>And so I beg you, dear one, if you've any pity for me, when you come to- morrow, don't look me straight in the face, for if I meet your eyes, it will be sure to make me laugh, especially as you'll be in that long gown.
<p/>I feel cold all over when I think of it, so when you come, don't look at me at all for a time, look at mamma or at the window....
<p/>You'll think I'm a nasty girl making fun of you, and you won't believe my letter. '' Here I've written you a love-letter.
<p/>Oh, dear, what have I done? Alyosha, don't despise me, and if I've done something very horrid and wounded you, forgive me.
<p/>Now the secret of my reputation, ruined perhaps for ever, is in your hands. '' I shall certainly cry to-day. Good-by till our meeting, our awful meeting.--LISE.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``P.S.--Alyosha! You must, must, must come!--LISE. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha read the note in amazement, read it through twice, thought a little, and suddenly laughed a soft, sweet laugh.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>LISE</b></font>) started. That laugh seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>LISE</b></font>) sinful. But a minute later he (<font color='blue'><b>LISE</b></font>) laughed again just as softly and happily. He (<font color='blue'><b>LISE</b></font>) slowly replaced the note in the envelope, crossed himself and lay down.
<p/>God, have mercy upon all of them, have all these unhappy and turbulent souls in Thy keeping, and set them in the right path.
<p/>The agitation in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heart passed at once. '' All ways are Thine. Save them according to Thy wisdom. Thou art love.
<p/>Thou wilt send joy to all!'' Alyosha murmured, crossing himself, and falling into peaceful sleep. PART II Book IV. Lacerations Chapter I. Father Ferapont Alyosha was roused early, before daybreak.
<p/>Father Zossima woke up feeling very weak, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) wanted to get out of bed and sit up in a chair.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) mind was quite clear; his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) face looked very tired, yet bright and almost joyful. It wore an expression of gayety, kindness and cordiality.
<p/>'' Maybe I shall not live through the coming day,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) said to Alyosha. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) desired to confess and take the sacrament at once.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) always confessed to Father Paďssy. After taking the communion, the service of extreme unction followed. The monks assembled and the cell was gradually filled up by the inmates of the hermitage.
<p/>Meantime it was daylight. People began coming from the monastery. After the service was over the elder desired to kiss and take leave of every one.
<p/>As the cell was so small the earlier visitors withdrew to make room for others. Alyosha stood beside the elder, who was seated again in his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) arm-chair.
<p/>I've been teaching you so many years, and therefore I've been talking aloud so many years, that I've got into the habit of talking, and so much so that it's almost more difficult for me to hold my tongue than to talk, even now, in spite of my weakness, dear Fathers and brothers,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) jested, looking with emotion at the group round him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) talked as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) could. Though his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) voice was weak, it was fairly steady. '' Alyosha remembered afterwards something of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said to them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) spoke of many things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) seemed anxious before the moment of death to say everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had not said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) life, and not simply for the sake of instructing them, but as though thirsting to share with all men and all creation his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) joy and ecstasy, and once more in his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) life to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) whole heart.
<p/>But though he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) spoke out distinctly and his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) voice was fairly steady, his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) speech was somewhat disconnected. '' Love one another, Fathers,'' said Father Zossima, as far as Alyosha could remember afterwards.
<p/>Because we have come here and shut ourselves within these walls, we are no holier than those that are outside, but on the contrary, from the very fact of coming here, each of us has confessed to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) is worse than others, than all men on earth...
<p/>'' Love God's people. And the longer the monk lives in his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) seclusion, the more keenly he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) must recognize that. Else he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) would have had no reason to come here.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) is not only worse than others, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) is responsible to all men for all and everything, for all human sins, national and individual, only then the aim of our seclusion is attained.
<p/>For know, dear ones, that every one of us is undoubtedly responsible for all men and everything on earth, not merely through the general sinfulness of creation, but each one personally for all mankind and every individual man.
<p/>This knowledge is the crown of life for the monk and for every man. For monks are not a special sort of men, but only what all men ought to be.
<p/>Then every one of you will have the power to win over the whole world by love and to wash away the sins of the world with your tears....
<p/>Only through that knowledge, our heart grows soft with infinite, universal, inexhaustible love. Each of you keep watch over your heart and confess your sins to yourself unceasingly.
<p/>Be not afraid of your sins, even when perceiving them, if only there be penitence, but make no conditions with God.
<p/>Again I say, Be not proud. Be proud neither to the little nor to the great. Hate not those who reject you, who insult you, who abuse and slander you.
<p/>Hate not the atheists, the teachers of evil, the materialists--and I mean not only the good ones--for there are many good ones among them, especially in our day--hate not even the wicked ones.
<p/>Remember them in your prayers thus: Save, O Lord, all those who have none to pray for them, save too all those who will not pray.
<p/>And add: it is not in pride that I make this prayer, O Lord, for I am lower than all men....
<p/>Love God's people, let not strangers draw away the flock, for if you slumber in your slothfulness and disdainful pride, or worse still, in covetousness, they will come from all sides and draw away your flock.
<p/>Expound the Gospel to the people unceasingly ... be not extortionate.... Do not love gold and silver, do not hoard them....
<p/>Have faith. Cling to the banner and raise it on high. '' But the elder spoke more disconnectedly than Alyosha reported his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) words afterwards.
<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) broke off altogether, as though to take breath, and recover his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) strength, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was in a sort of ecstasy.
<p/>When Alyosha happened for a moment to leave the cell, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was struck by the general excitement and suspense in the monks who were crowding about it.
<p/>They heard him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with emotion, though many wondered at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) words and found them obscure.... Afterwards all remembered those words. This anticipation showed itself in some by anxiety, in others by devout solemnity.
<p/>Their suspense was, from one point of view, almost frivolous, but even the most austere of the monks were affected by it.
<p/>All were expecting that some marvel would happen immediately after the elder's death. Father Paďssy's face looked the gravest of all.
<p/>Alyosha was mysteriously summoned by a monk to see Rakitin, who had arrived from town with a singular letter for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) from Madame Hohlakov.
<p/>It appeared that among the women who had come on the previous day to receive Father Zossima's blessing, there had been an old woman from the town, a sergeant's widow, called Prohorovna.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had inquired whether she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) might pray for the rest of the soul of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) son, Vassenka, who had gone to Irkutsk, and had sent her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) no news for over a year.
<p/>To which Father Zossima had answered sternly, forbidding her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) to do so, and saying that to pray for the living as though they were dead was a kind of sorcery.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) afterwards forgave her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) ignorance, and added, <div class="bookquote">``as though reading the book of the future''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>-LRB-this was Madame Hohlakov's expression-RRB-, words of comfort: <div class="bookquote">``that her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) son Vassya was certainly alive and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would either come himself very shortly or send a letter, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was to go home and expect him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>In it she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) informed Alyosha of a strange and very opportune incident. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Hohlakov</b></font>)</div>And <div class="bookquote">``Would you believe it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Hohlakov</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Madame Hohlakov enthusiastically, <div class="bookquote">``the prophecy has been fulfilled literally indeed, and more than that.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Hohlakov</b></font>)</div>Scarcely had the old woman reached home when they gave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a letter from Siberia which had been awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>But that was not all; in the letter written on the road from Ekaterinenburg, Vassya informed his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was returning to Russia with an official, and that three weeks after her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) receiving the letter he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hoped <div class="bookquote">``to embrace his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Madame Hohlakov warmly entreated Alyosha to report this new <div class="bookquote">``miracle of prediction''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>to the Superior and all the brotherhood. ''
<p/>All, all, ought to know of it! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) concluded. The letter had been written in haste, the excitement of the writer was apparent in every line of it.
<p/>Rakitin had commissioned the monk who brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) message ``to inform most respectfully his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) reverence Father Paďssy, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>), Rakitin, has a matter to speak of with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>), of such gravity that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) dare not defer it for a moment, and humbly begs forgiveness for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) presumption.
<p/>As the monk had given the message to Father Paďssy before that to Alyosha, the latter found after reading the letter, there was nothing left for him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) to do but to hand it to Father Paďssy in confirmation of the story.
<p/>And even that austere and cautious man, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) frowned as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read the news of the <div class="bookquote">``miracle,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>could not completely restrain some inner emotion.
<p/>But Alyosha had no need to tell the monks, for all knew of it already. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes gleamed, and a grave and solemn smile came into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips.
<p/>'' We shall see greater things!'' broke from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' We shall see greater things, greater things yet! '' the monks around repeated.
<p/>But Father Paďssy, frowning again, begged all of them, at least for a time, not to speak of the matter <div class="bookquote">``till it be more fully confirmed, seeing there is so much credulity among those of this world, and indeed this might well have chanced naturally,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paďssy/Father Paďssy</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) added, prudently, as it were to satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) conscience, though scarcely believing his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) own disavowal, a fact his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) listeners very clearly perceived.
<p/>Within the hour the <div class="bookquote">``miracle''  (<font color='red'><b>visitors</b></font>)</div>was of course known to the whole monastery, and many visitors who had come for the mass.
<p/>No one seemed more impressed by it than the monk who had come the day before from St. Sylvester, from the little monastery of Obdorsk in the far North.
<p/>It was he (<font color='blue'><b>Sylvester</b></font>) who had been standing near Madame Hohlakov the previous day and had asked Father Zossima earnestly, referring to the <div class="bookquote">``healing''  (<font color='red'><b>Zossima/Father Zossima/Father</b></font>)</div>of the lady's daughter, ``How can you presume to do such things?
<p/>The evening before he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) had visited Father Ferapont in his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) cell apart, behind the apiary, and had been greatly impressed and overawed by the visit.
<p/>This Father Ferapont was that aged monk so devout in fasting and observing silence who has been mentioned already, as antagonistic to Father Zossima and the whole institution of <div class="bookquote">``elders,''  (<font color='red'><b>Zossima/Father Zossima/Father</b></font>)</div>which he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) regarded as a pernicious and frivolous innovation.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was now somewhat puzzled and did not know whom to believe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was a very formidable opponent, although from his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) practice of silence he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) scarcely spoke a word to any one.
<p/>What made him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) formidable was that a number of monks fully shared his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) feeling, and many of the visitors looked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) as a great saint and ascetic, although they had no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was crazy.
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) lived in the hermitage they did not worry him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) to keep its regulations, and this too because he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) behaved as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) were crazy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was seventy-five or more, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) lived in a corner beyond the apiary in an old decaying wooden cell which had been built long ago for another great ascetic, Father Iona, who had lived to be a hundred and five, and of whose saintly doings many curious stories were still extant in the monastery and the neighborhood.
<p/>But it was just his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) craziness attracted them. Father Ferapont never went to see the elder. Father Ferapont had succeeded in getting himself installed in this same solitary cell seven years previously.
<p/>It was simply a peasant's hut, though it looked like a chapel, for it contained an extraordinary number of ikons with lamps perpetually burning before them--which men brought to the monastery as offerings to God.
<p/>Father Ferapont had been appointed to look after them and keep the lamps burning. It was said -LRB-and indeed it was true-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) ate only two pounds of bread in three days.
<p/>The beekeeper, who lived close by the apiary, used to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>beekeeper</b></font>) the bread every three days, and even to this man who waited upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Father Ferapont rarely uttered a word.
<p/>The four pounds of bread, together with the sacrament bread, regularly sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) on Sundays after the late mass by the Father Superior, made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) weekly rations.
<p/>The water in his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) jug was changed every day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) rarely appeared at mass. Visitors who came to do him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) homage saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) sometimes kneeling all day long at prayer without looking round.
<p/>On very rare occasions, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) would talk to visitors, but for the most part he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) would utter some one strange saying which was a complete riddle, and no entreaties would induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) to pronounce a word in explanation.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) addressed them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was brief, abrupt, strange, and almost always rude. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was not a priest, but a simple monk.
<p/>There was a strange belief, chiefly however among the most ignorant, that Father Ferapont had communication with heavenly spirits and would only converse with them, and so was silent with men.
<p/>The monk from Obdorsk, having been directed to the apiary by the beekeeper, who was also a very silent and surly monk, went to the corner where Father Ferapont's cell stood.
<p/>Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) will speak as you are a stranger and maybe you'll get nothing out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>),'' the beekeeper had warned him (<font color='blue'><b>beekeeper</b></font>).
<p/>'' The monk, as he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) related afterwards, approached in the utmost apprehension. It was rather late in the evening. Father Ferapont was sitting at the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) cell on a low bench.
<p/>A huge old elm was lightly rustling overhead. There was an evening freshness in the air. The monk from Obdorsk bowed down before the saint and asked his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) blessing.
<p/>'' Do you want me to bow down to you, monk?'' said Father Ferapont. <div class="bookquote">``Get up!''  (<font color='red'><b>The monk</b></font>)</div>The monk got up. ''
<p/>What most struck the poor monk was the fact that in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) strict fasting and great age, Father Ferapont still looked a vigorous old man.
<p/>Blessing, be blessed! Sit beside me. Where have you come from? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) was tall, held himself erect, and had a thin, but fresh and healthy face.
<p/>In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) great age he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) was not even quite gray, and still had very thick hair and a full beard, both of which had once been black.
<p/>There was no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) still had considerable strength. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) was of athletic build. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) eyes were gray, large and luminous, but strikingly prominent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) was dressed in a peasant's long reddish coat of coarse convict cloth -LRB-as it used to be called-RRB- and had a stout rope round his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) waist.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) spoke with a broad accent. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) throat and chest were bare. Beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) coat, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) shirt of the coarsest linen showed almost black with dirt, not having been changed for months.
<p/>They said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) wore irons weighing thirty pounds under his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) coat. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) stockingless feet were thrust in old slippers almost dropping to pieces.
<p/>From the little Obdorsk monastery, from St. Sylvester,'' the monk answered humbly, whilst his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) keen and inquisitive, but rather frightened little eyes kept watch on the hermit.
<p/>'' '' I have been at your Sylvester's. I used to stay there. Is Sylvester well? '' The monk hesitated. ''
<p/>You are a senseless lot! How do you keep the fasts?'' '' Our dietary is according to the ancient conventual rules.
<p/>During Lent there are no meals provided for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. For Tuesday and Thursday we have white bread, stewed fruit with honey, wild berries, or salt cabbage and wholemeal stirabout.
<p/>On Saturday white cabbage soup, noodles with peas, kasha, all with hemp oil. On weekdays we have dried fish and kasha with the cabbage soup.
<p/>From Monday till Saturday evening, six whole days in Holy Week, nothing is cooked, and we have only bread and water, and that sparingly; if possible not taking food every day, just the same as is ordered for first week in Lent.
<p/>In the same way on the Saturday we have to fast till three o'clock, and then take a little bread and water and drink a single cup of wine.
<p/>On Holy Thursday we drink wine and have something cooked without oil or not cooked at all, inasmuch as the Laodicean council lays down for Holy Thursday: `It is unseemly by remitting the fast on the Holy Thursday to dishonor the whole of Lent!'
<p/>But what is that compared with you, holy Father,'' added the monk, growing more confident, <div class="bookquote">``for all the year round, even at Easter, you take nothing but bread and water, and what we should eat in two days lasts you full seven.
<p/>On Good Friday nothing is eaten. This is how we keep the fast. It's truly marvelous--your great abstinence.''  (<font color='red'><b>the monk</b></font>)</div>'' And mushrooms?
<p/>I can give up their bread, not needing it at all, and go away into the forest and live there on the mushrooms or the berries, but they can't give up their bread here, wherefore they are in bondage to the devil.
<p/>'' asked Father Ferapont, suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``Mushrooms? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the monk</b></font>)</div>repeated the surprised monk. '' Yes. Nowadays the unclean deny that there is need of such fasting.
<p/>Haughty and unclean is their judgment.'' '' Och, true,'' sighed the monk. '' And have you seen devils among them?'' asked Ferapont.
<p/>'' Among them? Among whom?'' asked the monk, timidly. '' I went to the Father Superior on Trinity Sunday last year, I haven't been since.
<p/>I saw a devil sitting on one man's chest hiding under his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) cassock, only his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) horns poked out; another had one peeping out of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) pocket with such sharp eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was afraid of me; another settled in the unclean belly of one, another was hanging round a man's neck, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) about without seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''
<p/>When I was coming out from the Superior's I saw one hiding from me behind the door, and a big one, a yard and a half or more high, with a thick long gray tail, and the tip of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tail was in the crack of the door and I was quick and slammed the door, pinching his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tail in it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You--can see spirits? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the monk</b></font>)</div>the monk inquired. '' I tell you I can see, I can see through them. He (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) squealed and began to struggle, and I made the sign of the cross over him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) three times.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) died on the spot like a crushed spider. He (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) must have rotted there in the corner and be stinking, but they don't see, they don't smell it.
<p/>It's a year since I have been there. I reveal it to you, as you are a stranger.'' <div class="bookquote">``Your words are terrible!
<p/>But, holy and blessed Father,''  (<font color='red'><b>the monk</b></font>)</div>said the monk, growing bolder and bolder, <div class="bookquote">``is it true, as they noise abroad even to distant lands about you, that you are in continual communication with the Holy Ghost?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the monk</b></font>)</div><p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) does fly down at times. '' <div class="bookquote">``How does he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) fly down? In what form?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``As a bird.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Holy Ghost in the form of a dove?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Holy Ghost</b></font>)</div><p/>'' There's the Holy Ghost and there's the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit can appear as other birds--sometimes as a swallow, sometimes a goldfinch and sometimes as a blue-tit.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) from an ordinary tit?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) speaks. '' <div class="bookquote">``How does he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) speak, in what language?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Human language.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' And what does he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) tell you?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, to-day he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) told me that a fool would visit me and would ask me unseemly questions.
<p/>You want to know too much, monk. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>'' Terrible are your words, most holy and blessed Father,'' the monk shook his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) head.
<p/>But there was a doubtful look in his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) frightened little eyes. '' Do you see this tree?'' asked Father Ferapont, after a pause.
<p/>'' I do, blessed Father.'' '' You think it's an elm, but for me it has another shape. '' <div class="bookquote">``What sort of shape?
<p/>In the night it is Christ holding out His (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) arms to me and seeking me with those arms, I see it clearly and tremble.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the monk</b></font>)</div>inquired the monk, after a pause of vain expectation. '' It happens at night. You see those two branches? It's terrible, terrible!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What is there terrible if it's Christ Himself?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)'ll snatch me up and carry me away.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Alive?''  (<font color='red'><b>Elijah</b></font>)</div>``In the spirit and glory of Elijah, haven't you heard?
<p/>Though the monk returned to the cell he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) was sharing with one of the brothers, in considerable perplexity of mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) still cherished at heart a greater reverence for Father Ferapont than for Father Zossima.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was strongly in favor of fasting, and it was not strange that one who kept so rigid a fast as Father Ferapont should <div class="bookquote">``see marvels.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) words seemed certainly queer, but God only could tell what was hidden in those words, and were not worse words and acts commonly seen in those who have sacrificed their intellects for the glory of God?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will take me in His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) arms and bear me away. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ferapont/Father Ferapont</b></font>)</div>'' The pinching of the devil's tail he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was ready and eager to believe, and not only in the figurative sense.
<p/>Besides he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had, before visiting the monastery, a strong prejudice against the institution of <div class="bookquote">``elders,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) only knew of by hearsay and believed to be a pernicious innovation.
<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had been long at the monastery, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had detected the secret murmurings of some shallow brothers who disliked the institution.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was, besides, a meddlesome, inquisitive man, who poked his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) nose into everything. This was why the news of the fresh <div class="bookquote">``miracle''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>performed by Father Zossima reduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) to extreme perplexity.
<p/>Alyosha remembered afterwards how their inquisitive guest from Obdorsk had been continually flitting to and fro from one group to another, listening and asking questions among the monks that were crowding within and without the elder's cell.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) had no thought to spare for it indeed, for when Father Zossima, feeling tired again, had gone back to bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) thought of Alyosha as he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) was closing his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) eyes, and sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>).
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) did not pay much attention to him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) at the time, and only recollected it afterwards. Alyosha ran at once.
<p/>The elder, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) weary eyes and looking intently at Alyosha, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) suddenly: <div class="bookquote">``Are your people expecting you, my son?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>There was no one else in the cell but Father Paďssy, Father Iosif, and the novice Porfiry. Alyosha hesitated. '' Haven't they need of you?
<p/>Didn't you promise some one yesterday to see them to-day?'' <div class="bookquote">``I did promise--to my father--my brothers--others too.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You see, you must go.
<p/>Don't grieve. Be sure I shall not die without your being by to hear my last word. To you I will say that word, my son, it will be my last gift to you.
<p/>To you, dear son, because you love me. But now go to keep your promise. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha immediately obeyed, though it was hard to go.
<p/>But the promise that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) should hear his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) last word on earth, that it should be the last gift to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), Alyosha, sent a thrill of rapture through his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) soul.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) made haste that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might finish what he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had to do in the town and return quickly. Father Paďssy, too, uttered some words of exhortation which moved and surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) greatly.
<p/>Remember, young man, unceasingly,'' Father Paďssy began, without preface, <div class="bookquote">``that the science of this world, which has become a great power, has, especially in the last century, analyzed everything divine handed down to us in the holy books.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) spoke as they left the cell together. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Paďssy/Father Paďssy</b></font>)</div>After this cruel analysis the learned of this world have nothing left of all that was sacred of old.
<p/>But they have only analyzed the parts and overlooked the whole, and indeed their blindness is marvelous. Yet the whole still stands steadfast before their eyes, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
<p/>Has it not lasted nineteen centuries, is it not still a living, a moving power in the individual soul and in the masses of people?
<p/>For even those who have renounced Christianity and attack it, in their inmost being still follow the Christian ideal, for hitherto neither their subtlety nor the ardor of their hearts has been able to create a higher ideal of man and of virtue than the ideal given by Christ of old.
<p/>It is still as strong and living even in the souls of atheists, who have destroyed everything! When it has been attempted, the result has been only grotesque.
<p/>Maybe, remembering this great day, you will not forget my words, uttered from the heart for your guidance, seeing you are young, and the temptations of the world are great and beyond your strength to endure.
<p/>Remember this especially, young man, since you are being sent into the world by your departing elder. Well, now go, my orphan.
<p/>As Alyosha left the monastery and thought them over, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suddenly realized that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had met a new and unexpected friend, a warmly loving teacher, in this austere monk who had hitherto treated him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) sternly.
<p/>It was as though Father Zossima had bequeathed him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) death, and <div class="bookquote">``perhaps that's just what had passed between them,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Alyosha thought suddenly.
<p/>'' With these words Father Paďssy blessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>). The philosophic reflections he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) had just heard so unexpectedly testified to the warmth of Father Paďssy's heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was in haste to arm the boy's mind for conflict with temptation and to guard the young soul left in his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) charge with the strongest defense he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) could imagine.
<p/>On the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) remembered that his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) father had insisted the day before that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) should come without his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) brother Ivan seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).
<p/>Chapter II. At His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) Father's First of all, Alyosha went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) father. '' Why so? '' Alyosha wondered suddenly. ''
<p/>Even if my father has something to say to me alone, why should I go in unseen? Most likely in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) excitement yesterday he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) meant to say something different,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) decided.
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was very glad when Marfa Ignatyevna, who opened the garden gate to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) -LRB-Grigory, it appeared, was ill in bed in the lodge-RRB-, told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) question that Ivan Fyodorovitch had gone out two hours ago.
<p/>'' And my father?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is up, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) coffee,'' Marfa answered somewhat dryly. Alyosha went in. The old man was sitting alone at the table wearing slippers and a little old overcoat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was amusing himself by looking through some accounts, rather inattentively however. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was quite alone in the house, for Smerdyakov too had gone out marketing.
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had got up early and was trying to put a bold face on it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked tired and weak.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead, upon which huge purple bruises had come out during the night, was bandaged with a red handkerchief; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose too had swollen terribly in the night, and some smaller bruises covered it in patches, giving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole face a peculiarly spiteful and irritable look.
<p/>The old man was aware of this, and turned a hostile glance on Alyosha as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came in. '' The coffee is cold,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried harshly; <div class="bookquote">``I won't offer you any.
<p/>I've ordered nothing but a Lenten fish soup to-day, and I don't invite any one to share it. Why have you come?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' To find out how you are,'' said Alyosha. '' Yes. Besides, I told you to come yesterday. It's all of no consequence.
<p/>You need not have troubled. But I knew you'd come poking in directly. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said this with almost hostile feeling.
<p/>At the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got up and looked anxiously in the looking-glass -LRB-perhaps for the fortieth time that morning-RRB- at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began, too, binding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) red handkerchief more becomingly on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead. '' Red's better. It's just like the hospital in a white one,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) observed sententiously.
<p/>'' Well, how are things over there? How is your elder?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is very bad; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may die to-day,'' answered Alyosha.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father had not listened, and had forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own question at once. '' Ivan's gone out,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said suddenly.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) utmost to carry off Mitya's betrothed. That's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is staying here for,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) added maliciously, and, twisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) mouth, looked at Alyosha.
<p/>'' Surely he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) did not tell you so?'' asked Alyosha. '' Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) did, long ago. Would you believe it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) told me three weeks ago?
<p/>You don't suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) too came to murder me, do you? He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) must have had some object in coming. '' ''
<p/>What do you mean? Why do you say such things? '' said Alyosha, troubled. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) doesn't ask for money, it's true, but yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) won't get a farthing from me.
<p/>I intend living as long as possible, you may as well know, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, and so I need every farthing, and
<p/>the longer I live, the more I shall need it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) continued, pacing from one corner of the room to the other, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) hands in the pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) loose greasy overcoat made of yellow cotton material.
<p/>I can still pass for a man at five and fifty, but I want to pass for one for another twenty years.
<p/>'' As I get older, you know, I shan't be a pretty object. The wenches won't come to me of their own accord, so I shall want my money.
<p/>So I am saving up more and more, simply for myself, my dear son Alexey Fyodorovitch. You may as well know.
<p/>For sin is sweet; all abuse it, but all men live in it, only others do it on the sly, and I openly.
<p/>For I mean to go on in my sins to the end, let me tell you. And so all the other sinners fall upon me for being so simple.
<p/>And your paradise, Alexey Fyodorovitch, is not to my taste, let me tell you that; and it's not the proper place for a gentleman, your paradise, even if it exists.
<p/>I believe that I fall asleep and don't wake up again, and that's all. You can pray for my soul if you like.
<p/>And if you don't want to, don't, damn you! That's my philosophy. Ivan talked well here yesterday, though we were all drunk.
<p/>Ivan is a conceited coxcomb, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) has no particular learning ... nor education either. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) sits silent and smiles at one without speaking--that's what pulls him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) through.''
<p/>Alyosha listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) in silence. '' Why won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) talk to me? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) does speak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) gives himself airs.
<p/>Your Ivan is a scoundrel! And I'll marry Grushenka in a minute if I want to. For if you've money, Alexey Fyodorovitch, you have only to want a thing
<p/>That's what Ivan is afraid of, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is on the watch to prevent me getting married and that's why he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is egging on Mitya to marry Grushenka himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hopes to keep me from Grushenka by that -LRB-as though I should leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) my money if I don't marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)!-RRB-.
<p/>and you can have it. Besides if Mitya marries Grushenka, Ivan will carry off his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) rich betrothed, that's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s reckoning on!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is a scoundrel, your Ivan!'' <div class="bookquote">``How cross you are! It's because of yesterday; you had better lie down,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha.
<p/>you say that,'' the old man observed suddenly, as though it had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for the first time, <div class="bookquote">``and I am not angry with you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>There! But if Ivan said it, I should be angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). It is only with you I have good moments

<p/>If I liked, I could crush him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and could have him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) locked up at once for what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did yesterday.''

<p/>But if she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hears that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) has beaten me, a weak old man, within an inch of my life, she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) may give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up and come to me...
<p/>'' If I send the ruffian to prison, she (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'ll hear of it and run to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at once. For that's her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) way,
<p/>everything by contraries. I know her (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) through and through! Won't you have a drop of brandy? Take some cold coffee and I'll pour a quarter of a glass of brandy into it
<p/>I'll take that roll with me if I may,'' said Alyosha, and taking a halfpenny French roll he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put it in the pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cassock.
<p/>, it's delicious, my boy.'' '' No, thank you. '' And you'd better not have brandy, either,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suggested apprehensively, looking into the old man's face.
<p/>'' You are quite right, it irritates my nerves instead of soothing them. Only one little glass. I'll get it out of the cupboard.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unlocked the cupboard, poured out a glass, drank it, then locked the cupboard and put the key back in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>'' '' That's enough. One glass won't kill me.'' <div class="bookquote">``You see you are in a better humor now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha, smiling.
<p/>'' Um! I love you even without the brandy, but with scoundrels I am a scoundrel. Ivan is not going to Tchermashnya--why is that?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) wants to spy how much I give Grushenka if she (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrels</b></font>) comes. They are all scoundrels! But I don't recognize Ivan, I don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) at all.
<p/>Where does he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) come from? He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is not one of us in soul. As though I'd leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) anything! I shan't leave a will at all, you may as well know.
<p/>And I'll crush Mitya like a beetle. I squash black-beetles at night with my slipper; they squelch when you tread on them.
<p/>And your Mitya will squelch too. Your Mitya, for you love him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). Yes, you love him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) and I am not afraid of your loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>But if Ivan loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) I should be afraid for myself at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). But Ivan loves nobody. Ivan is not one of us.
<p/>People like Ivan are not our sort, my boy. They are like a cloud of dust. When the wind blows, the dust will be gone....
<p/>I had a silly idea in my head when I told you to come to-day; I wanted to find out from you about Mitya.
<p/>If I were to hand him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) over a thousand or maybe two now, would the beggarly wretch agree to take himself off altogether for five years or, better still, thirty-five, and without Grushenka, and give her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) up once for all, eh?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I'll ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>muttered Alyosha.

<p/>I've changed my mind. It was a nonsensical idea of mine. I won't give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) anything, not a penny, I want my money myself,'' cried the old man, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.

<p/>Is that betrothed of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Katerina Ivanovna, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has kept so carefully hidden from me all this time, going to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) or

<p/>They are poor creatures I tell you, those pale young ladies, very different from-- I'd have been a conquering hero just as he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) is.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) is a low cad! But he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) shan't have Grushenka, anyway, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) shan't! I'll crush him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>)!'' His (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) anger had returned with the last words.
<p/>'' You can go. There's nothing for you to do here to-day,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) snapped harshly. Alyosha went up to say good-by to him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>), and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) on the shoulder.
<p/>'' What's that for? '' The old man was a little surprised. '' We shall see each other again, or do you think we shan't?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, I didn't mean anything.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Nor did I, I did not mean anything,'' said the old man, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>And as soon as Alyosha had gone out of the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to the cupboard again and poured out another half-glass.
<p/>Be sure to come! Come to-morrow, do you hear, to-morrow!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' I won't have more!

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bedroom, lay down on the bed, exhausted, and in one minute he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was asleep. Chapter III.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank goodness he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not ask me about Grushenka,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>thought Alyosha, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's house and turned towards Madame Hohlakov's, <div class="bookquote">``or I might have to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of my meeting with Grushenka yesterday.
<p/>A Meeting With The Schoolboys ''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Hohlakov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha felt painfully that since yesterday both combatants had renewed their energies, and that their hearts had grown hard again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too will be harder than yesterday, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too must be spiteful and angry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too, no doubt, has made some plan.
<p/>'' Father is spiteful and angry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'s made some plan and will stick to it. And what of Dmitri? Oh, I must succeed in finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) to-day, whatever happens.
<p/>'' But Alyosha had not long to meditate. An incident occurred on the road, which, though apparently of little consequence, made a great impression on him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>).
<p/>Just after he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had crossed the square and turned the corner coming out into Mihailovsky Street, which is divided by a small ditch from the High Street -LRB-our whole town is intersected by ditches-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) saw a group of schoolboys between the ages of nine and twelve, at the bridge.
<p/>They were going home from school, some with their bags on their shoulders, others with leather satchels slung across them, some in short jackets, others in little overcoats.
<p/>Some even had those high boots with creases round the ankles, such as little boys spoilt by rich fathers love to wear.
<p/>Alyosha had never from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) Moscow days been able to pass children without taking notice of them, and although he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was particularly fond of children of three or thereabout, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) liked schoolboys of ten and eleven too.
<p/>The whole group was talking eagerly about something, apparently holding a council. And so, anxious as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was to-day , he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) wanted at once to turn aside to talk to them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) looked into their excited rosy faces, and noticed at once that all the boys had stones in their hands. Behind the ditch some thirty paces away, there was another schoolboy standing by a fence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) too had a satchel at his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) side. He (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) was about ten years old, pale, delicate-looking and with sparkling black eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) kept an attentive and anxious watch on the other six, obviously his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) schoolfellows with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) had just come out of school, but with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) had evidently had a feud.
<p/>Alyosha went up and, addressing a fair, curly-headed, rosy boy in a black jacket, observed: <div class="bookquote">``When I used to wear a satchel like yours, I always used to carry it on my left side, so as to have my right hand free, but you've got yours on your right side.
<p/>So it will be awkward for you to get at it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div>Alyosha had no art or premeditation in beginning with this practical remark.
<p/>But it is the only way for a grown-up person to get at once into confidential relations with a child, or still more with a group of children.
<p/>One must begin in a serious, businesslike way so as to be on a perfectly equal footing. Alyosha understood it by instinct.
<p/>'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) is left-handed,'' another, a fine healthy-looking boy of eleven, answered promptly. All the others stared at Alyosha. ''
<p/>At that instant a stone flew into the group, but only just grazed the left-handed boy, though it was well and vigorously thrown by the boy standing the other side of the ditch.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) even throws stones with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) left hand,'' observed a third. '' Give it him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), hit him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) back, Smurov,'' they all shouted.
<p/>But Smurov, the left-handed boy, needed no telling, and at once revenged himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) threw a stone, but it missed the boy and hit the ground.
<p/>The boy the other side of the ditch, the pocket of whose coat was visibly bulging with stones, flung another stone at the group; this time it flew straight at Alyosha and hit him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) painfully on the shoulder.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) aimed it at you, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) meant it for you. You are Karamazov, Karamazov! '' the boys shouted, laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Come, all throw at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) at once!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>and six stones flew at the boy.
<p/>One struck the boy on the head and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fell down, but at once leapt up and began ferociously returning their fire.
<p/>Both sides threw stones incessantly. Many of the group had their pockets full too. '' What are you about! Aren't you ashamed?
<p/>Six against one! Why, you'll kill him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),'' cried Alyosha. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ran forward and met the flying stones to screen the solitary boy.
<p/>Three or four ceased throwing for a minute. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) began first!'' cried a boy in a red shirt in an angry childish voice.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is a beast, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stabbed Krassotkin in class the other day with a penknife. It bled. Krassotkin wouldn't tell tales, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) must be thrashed.''
<p/>'' But what for? I suppose you tease him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). '' <div class="bookquote">``There, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sent a stone in your back again, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knows you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>cried the children.
<p/>'' It's you he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is throwing at now, not us. Come, all of you, at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) again, don't miss, Smurov! '' and again a fire of stones, and a very vicious one, began.
<p/>The boy the other side of the ditch was hit in the chest; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) screamed, began to cry and ran away uphill towards Mihailovsky Street.
<p/>They all shouted: <div class="bookquote">``Aha, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is funking, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is running away. Wisp of tow! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You don't know what a beast he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is,
<p/>Karamazov, killing is too good for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy in the jacket, with flashing eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seemed to be the eldest.
<p/>'' What's wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)? '' asked Alyosha, <div class="bookquote">``is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a tell-tale or what? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>The boys looked at one another as though derisively.
<p/>'' Are you going that way, to Mihailovsky? '' the same boy went on. '' Catch him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up.... You see he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s stopped again, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is waiting and looking at you.''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is looking at you,'' the other boys chimed in. '' You ask him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), does he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) like a disheveled wisp of tow.
<p/>Do you hear, ask him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that! '' There was a general burst of laughter. Alyosha looked at them, and they at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>'' Don't go near him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll hurt you,'' cried Smurov in a warning voice. '' I shan't ask him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) about the wisp of tow, for I expect you tease him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with that question somehow.
<p/>But I'll find out from him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) why you hate him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) so.'' <div class="bookquote">``Find out then, find out,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>cried the boys, laughing. Alyosha crossed the bridge and walked uphill by the fence, straight towards the boy.
<p/>'' You'd better look out,'' the boys called after him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) won't be afraid of you. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will stab you in a minute, on the sly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did Krassotkin.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The boy waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) without budging. Coming up to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), Alyosha saw facing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a child of about nine years old.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was an undersized weakly boy with a thin pale face, with large dark eyes that gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) vindictively. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was dressed in a rather shabby old overcoat, which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had monstrously outgrown.
<p/>There was a large patch on the right knee of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) trousers, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) right boot just at the toe there was a big hole in the leather, carefully blackened with ink.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bare arms stuck out beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sleeves. Both the pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) great-coat were weighed down with stones. Alyosha stopped two steps in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), looking inquiringly at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>The boy, seeing at once from Alyosha's eyes that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wouldn't beat him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), became less defiant, and addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) first. ''
<p/>I am alone, and there are six of them. I'll beat them all, alone! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said suddenly, with flashing eyes.
<p/>'' I think one of the stones must have hurt you badly,'' observed Alyosha. '' But I hit Smurov on the head!'' cried the boy.
<p/>'' They told me that you know me, and that you threw a stone at me on purpose,'' said Alyosha. The boy looked darkly at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>the boy cried irritably; but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did not move, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were expecting something, and again there was a vindictive light in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' I don't know you. Do you know me?'' Alyosha continued. <div class="bookquote">``Let me alone! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Very well, I am going,'' said Alyosha; ``only I don't know you
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Monk in silk trousers!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried the boy, following Alyosha with the same vindictive and defiant expression, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) threw himself into an attitude of defense, feeling sure that now Alyosha would fall upon him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); but Alyosha turned, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and walked away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had not gone three steps before the biggest stone the boy had in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pocket hit him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a painful blow in the back.
<p/>and I don't tease you. They told me how they tease you, but I don't want to tease you. Good-by!'' ''
<p/>So you'll hit a man from behind! They tell the truth, then, when they say that you attack on the sly,'' said Alyosha, turning round again.
<p/>This time the boy threw a stone savagely right into Alyosha's face; but Alyosha just had time to guard himself, and the stone struck him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) on the elbow.
<p/>'' Aren't you ashamed? What have I done to you? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cried. The boy waited in silent defiance, certain that now Alyosha would attack him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>Seeing that even now he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would not, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) rage was like a little wild beast's; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) flew at Alyosha himself, and before Alyosha had time to move, the spiteful child had seized his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) left hand with both of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and bit his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) middle finger.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) teeth in it and it was ten seconds before he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) let go. Alyosha cried out with pain and pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) finger away with all his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might.
<p/>The child let go at last and retreated to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) former distance. Alyosha's finger had been badly bitten to the bone, close to the nail; it began to bleed.
<p/>Alyosha took out his (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) handkerchief and bound it tightly round his (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) injured hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) was a full minute bandaging it. The boy stood waiting all the time.
<p/>At last Alyosha raised his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gentle eyes and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). '' Very well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you see how badly you've bitten me.
<p/>That's enough, isn't it? Now tell me, what have I done to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The boy stared in amazement. '' Though I don't know you
<p/>'' Alyosha went on with the same serenity, <div class="bookquote">``yet I must have done something to you--you wouldn't have hurt me like this for nothing.
<p/>and it's the first time I've seen you, So what have I done? How have I wronged you, tell me? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/>Alyosha walked slowly after him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) towards Mihailovsky Street, and for a long time he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saw the child running in the distance as fast as ever, not turning his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head, and no doubt still keeping up his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tearful wail.
<p/>Instead of answering, the boy broke into a loud tearful wail and ran away. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mind to find him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) out as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had time, and to solve this mystery.
<p/>At The Hohlakovs' Alyosha soon reached Madame Hohlakov's house, a handsome stone house of two stories, one of the finest in our town.
<p/>Though Madame Hohlakov spent most of her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) time in another province where she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had an estate, or in Moscow, where she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had a house of her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had a house in our town too, inherited from her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) forefathers.
<p/>The estate in our district was the largest of her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) three estates, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been very little in our province before this time.
<p/>Just now he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had not the time. Chapter IV. She (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ran out to Alyosha in the hall. '' Did you get my letter about the new miracle?
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spoke rapidly and nervously. '' Yes.'' <div class="bookquote">``Did you show it to every one? He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) restored the son to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is dying to-day,'' said Alyosha. '' I have heard, I know, oh, how I long to talk to you, to you or some one, about all this.
<p/>No, to you, to you! And how sorry I am I can't see him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)! The whole town is in excitement, they are all suspense.
<p/>But now--do you know Katerina Ivanovna is here now?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's lucky,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Alyosha. '' Then I shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) here.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) told me yesterday to be sure to come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) to-day.'' <div class="bookquote">``I know, I know all. I've heard exactly what happened yesterday--and the atrocious behavior of that--creature.
<p/>C'est tragique , and if I'd been in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) place I don't know what I should have done. And your brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch, what do you think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)?--my goodness!
<p/>Alexey Fyodorovitch, I am forgetting, only fancy; your brother is in there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), not that dreadful brother who was so shocking yesterday, but the other, Ivan Fyodorovitch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) talking; they are having a serious conversation.
<p/>If you could only imagine what's passing between them now--it's awful, I tell you it's lacerating, it's like some incredible tale of horror.
<p/>They are ruining their lives for no reason any one can see. They both recognize it and revel in it. I've been watching for you!
<p/>I've been thirsting for you! It's too much for me, that's the worst of it. I'll tell you all about it presently, but now I must speak of something else, the most important thing
<p/>--I had quite forgotten what's most important. Tell me, why has Lise been in hysterics? As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) heard you were here, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) began to be hysterical!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Maman , it's you who are hysterical now, not I,'' Lise's voice caroled through a tiny crack of the door at the side.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) voice sounded as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) wanted to laugh, but was doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) utmost to control it. Alyosha at once noticed the crack, and no doubt Lise was peeping through it, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) could not see.
<p/>'' And no wonder, Lise, no wonder ... your caprices will make me hysterical too. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) is so ill, Alexey Fyodorovitch
<p/>, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) has been so ill all night, feverish and moaning! I could hardly wait for the morning and for Herzenstube to come.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) can make nothing of it, that we must wait. Herzenstube always comes and says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) can make nothing of it.
<p/>As soon as you approached the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) screamed, fell into hysterics, and insisted on being wheeled back into this room here.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, I didn't know he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had come. It wasn't on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) account I wanted to be wheeled into this room. ''

<p/>And that tragedy in the drawing-room, it's more than I can bear, I warn you. I can't bear it. A comedy, perhaps, not a tragedy.

<p/>Madame Hohlakov screamed and shut her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes. '' Good heavens, what a wound, how awful!'' But as soon as Lise saw Alyosha's finger through the crack, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) flung the door wide open.
<p/>'' Come, come here,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) cried, imperiously. '' No nonsense now! Good heavens, why did you stand there saying nothing about it all this time?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) might have bled to death, mamma! How did you do it? Water, water! Make haste, mamma, some water in a slop-basin.
<p/>But do make haste,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) finished nervously. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) was quite frightened at the sight of Alyosha's wound. '' Shouldn't we send for Herzenstube?
<p/>'' cried Madame Hohlakov. '' Mamma, you'll be the death of me. Your Herzenstube will come and say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) can make nothing of it!

Yulia ran in with water and Alyosha put his (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) finger in it.
<p/>'' Some lint, mamma, for mercy's sake, bring some lint and that muddy caustic lotion for wounds, what's it called? We've got some.
<p/>You know where the bottle is, mamma; it's in your bedroom in the right-hand cupboard, there's a big bottle of it there with the lint.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I'll bring everything in a minute, Lise, only don't scream and don't fuss. You see how bravely Alexey Fyodorovitch bears it.
<p/>Where did you get such a dreadful wound, Alexey Fyodorovitch? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Hohlakov</b></font>)</div>Madame Hohlakov hastened away. This was all Lise was waiting for.
<p/>'' First of all, answer the question, where did you get hurt like this? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) asked Alyosha, quickly. '' And then I'll talk to you about something quite different.
<p/>Instinctively feeling that the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) mother's absence was precious for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>), Alyosha hastened to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) enigmatic meeting with the schoolboys in the fewest words possible.
<p/>Well?'' Lise clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) hands at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) story. '' How can you, and in that dress too, associate with schoolboys? ''
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) cried angrily, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) had a right to control him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>). '' You are nothing but a boy yourself if you can do that, a perfect boy!
<p/>But you must find out for me about that horrid boy and tell me all about it, for there's some mystery in it.

 (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div><p/>'' That's enough, mamma, enough about Herzenstube,'' Lise laughed gayly. <div class="bookquote">``Make haste with the lint and the lotion, mamma.

<p/>Would you believe it, mamma, on the way here he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had a fight with the boys in the street, and it was a boy bit his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) finger, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a child, a child himself?
<p/>Is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fit to be married after that? For only fancy, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wants to be married, mamma. Just think of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) married, wouldn't it be funny, wouldn't it be awful?''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And I kiss you too, Lise. Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch,'' Madame Hohlakov began mysteriously and importantly, speaking in a rapid whisper.
<p/>I don't want to suggest anything, I don't want to lift the veil, you will see for yourself what's going on.
<p/>'' It's appalling. It's the most fantastic farce. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) loves your brother, Ivan, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) is doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) utmost to persuade herself
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) loves your brother, Dmitri. It's appalling! I'll go in with you, and if they don't turn me out, I'll stay to the end.
<p/>'' Chapter V. A Laceration In The Drawing-Room But in the drawing-room the conversation was already over. Katerina Ivanovna was greatly excited, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) looked resolute.
<p/>At the moment Alyosha and Madame Hohlakov entered, Ivan Fyodorovitch stood up to take leave. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) face was rather pale, and Alyosha looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) anxiously.
<p/>During the preceding month it had been several times suggested to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) brother Ivan was in love with Katerina Ivanovna, and, what was more, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) meant <div class="bookquote">``to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) off''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>from Dmitri.
<p/>For this moment was to solve a doubt, a harassing enigma which had for some time haunted Alyosha. Until quite lately the idea seemed to Alyosha monstrous, though it worried him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) extremely.
<p/>Meantime, Dmitri had said outright on the previous day that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was glad that Ivan was his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) rival, and that it was a great assistance to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), Dmitri.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) loved both his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) brothers, and dreaded such rivalry between them. In what way did it assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)? To marry Grushenka?
<p/>Besides all this, Alyosha had till the evening before implicitly believed that Katerina Ivanovna had a steadfast and passionate love for Dmitri; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had only believed it till the evening before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had fancied, too, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was incapable of loving a man like Ivan, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) did love Dmitri, and loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was, in spite of all the strangeness of such a passion.
<p/>The word <div class="bookquote">``lacerating,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Hohlakov</b></font>)</div>which Madame Hohlakov had just uttered, almost made him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) start, because half waking up towards daybreak that night he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had cried out <div class="bookquote">``Laceration, laceration,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>probably applying it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) dream.
<p/>But that Alyosha considered the worst thing possible. But during yesterday's scene with Grushenka another idea had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had been dreaming all night of the previous day's scene at Katerina Ivanovna's.
<p/>Now Alyosha was impressed by Madame Hohlakov's blunt and persistent assertion that Katerina Ivanovna was in love with Ivan, and only deceived herself through some sort of pose, from <div class="bookquote">``self-laceration,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>and tortured herself by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) pretended love for Dmitri from some fancied duty of gratitude.
<p/>'' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps the whole truth lies in those words. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But in that case what was Ivan's position?
<p/>Alyosha felt instinctively that a character like Katerina Ivanovna's must dominate, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) could only dominate some one like Dmitri, and never a man like Ivan.
<p/>For Dmitri might at last submit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) domination <div class="bookquote">``to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) own happiness''  (<font color='red'><b>Dmitri/Dmitri Fyodorovitch/Dmitri Karamazov</b></font>)</div>-LRB-which was what Alyosha would have desired-RRB-, but Ivan--no, Ivan could not submit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), and such submission would not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) happiness.
<p/>Alyosha could not help believing that of Ivan. And now all these doubts and reflections flitted through his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) mind as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) entered the drawing-room.
<p/>It must be noted that Alyosha felt as it were ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) own thoughts and blamed himself when they kept recurring to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) during the last month.
<p/>Another idea, too, forced itself upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``What if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) loved neither of them--neither Ivan nor Dmitri? ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' What do I know about love and women and how can I decide such questions?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) felt instinctively that this rivalry was of immense importance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) brothers' lives and that a great deal depended upon it.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) thought reproachfully, after such doubts and surmises. And yet it was impossible not to think about it. '' One reptile will devour the other,'' Ivan had pronounced the day before, speaking in anger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father and Dmitri.
<p/>So Ivan looked upon Dmitri as a reptile, and perhaps had long done so. Was it perhaps since he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had known Katerina Ivanovna?
<p/>That phrase had, of course, escaped Ivan unawares yesterday, but that only made it more important. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) felt like that, what chance was there of peace?
<p/>Were there not, on the contrary, new grounds for hatred and hostility in their family? And with which of them was Alyosha to sympathize?
<p/>And what was he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) to wish for each of them? He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) loved them both, but what could he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) desire for each in the midst of these conflicting interests?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) might go quite astray in this maze, and Alyosha's heart could not endure uncertainty, because his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) love was always of an active character.
<p/>And to do so he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) must know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was aiming at; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) must know for certain what was best for each, and having ascertained this it was natural for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) to help them both.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was incapable of passive love. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) loved any one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) set to work at once to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). But instead of a definite aim, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) found nothing but uncertainty and perplexity on all sides.
<p/>'' It was lacerating,'' as was said just now. But what could he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) understand even in this <div class="bookquote">``laceration'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>? He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) did not understand the first word in this perplexing maze.
<p/>Seeing Alyosha, Katerina Ivanovna said quickly and joyfully to Ivan, who had already got up to go, <div class="bookquote">``A minute! Stay another minute!
<p/>I want to hear the opinion of this person here whom I trust absolutely. Don't go away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) added, addressing Madame Hohlakov.
<p/>You are all my friends here, all I have in the world, my dear friends,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) began warmly, in a voice which quivered with genuine tears of suffering, and Alyosha's heart warmed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) at once.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) made Alyosha sit down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), and Madame Hohlakov sat opposite, by Ivan. '' '' You, Alexey Fyodorovitch, were witness yesterday of that abominable scene, and saw what I did.
<p/>I only know one thing, that if it were repeated to-day, this minute, I should express the same feelings again as yesterday--the same feelings, the same words, the same actions.
<p/>You did not see it, Ivan Fyodorovitch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) did. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) thought of me yesterday I don't know. You remember my actions, Alexey Fyodorovitch; you checked me in one of them'' ...
<p/>-LRB-as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) said that, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) flushed and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) eyes shone-RRB-. '' I must tell you that I can't get over it.
<p/>Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I don't even know whether I still love him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) . I feel pity for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), and that is a poor sign of love.
<p/>If I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), if I still loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), perhaps I shouldn't be sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) now, but should hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>).
<p/>'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) voice quivered, and tears glittered on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) eyelashes. Alyosha shuddered inwardly. '' That girl is truthful and sincere,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) does not love Dmitri any more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' That's true, that's true,'' cried Madame Hohlakov. '' Wait, dear. I haven't told you the chief, the final decision I came to during the night.
<p/>I feel that perhaps my decision is a terrible one--for me, but I foresee that nothing will induce me to change it--nothing.
<p/>My dear, kind, ever-faithful and generous adviser, the one friend I have in the world, Ivan Fyodorovitch, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) deep insight into the heart, approves and commends my decision.
<p/>It will be so all my life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) knows it.'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I approve of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan assented, in a subdued but firm voice.
<p/>Alexey Fyodorovitch, forgive my calling you simply Alyosha-RRB-, I should like Alexey Fyodorovitch, too, to tell me before my two friends whether I am right.
<p/>I feel instinctively that you, Alyosha, my dear brother -LRB-for you are a dear brother to me-RRB-,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said again ecstatically, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cold hand in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hot one, <div class="bookquote">``I foresee that your decision, your approval, will bring me peace, in spite of all my sufferings, for, after your words, I shall be calm and submit--I feel that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But I should like Alyosha, too -LRB-Ah! <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you are asking me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha, flushing. '' I only know that I love you and at this moment wish for your happiness more than my own!...
<p/>But I know nothing about such affairs,'' something impelled him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) to add hurriedly. '' In such affairs, Alexey Fyodorovitch, in such affairs, the chief thing is honor and duty and something higher--
<p/>I don't know what--but higher perhaps even than duty. I am conscious of this irresistible feeling in my heart, and it compels me irresistibly.
<p/>But it may all be put in two words. I've already decided, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) marries that--creature,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) began solemnly, <div class="bookquote">``whom I never, never can forgive,
<p/>even then I will not abandon him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) . Henceforward I will never, never abandon him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cried, breaking into a sort of pale, hysterical ecstasy.
<p/>I will go away to another town--where you like--but I will watch over him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) all my life--I will watch over him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) all my life unceasingly.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) becomes unhappy with that woman, and that is bound to happen quite soon, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) come to me and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) will find a friend, a sister....
<p/>Only a sister, of course, and so for ever; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) will learn at least that that sister is really his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) sister, who loves him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) and has sacrificed all her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) life to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>).
<p/>'' Not that I would run after him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) continually, get in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) way and worry him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>). Oh, no! I will gain my point.
<p/>I will insist on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) knowing me and confiding entirely in me, without reserve,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cried, in a sort of frenzy.
<p/>I will be a god to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) can pray--and that, at least, he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) owes me for his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) treachery and for what I suffered yesterday through him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>).
<p/>And let him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) see that all my life I will be true to him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) and the promise I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>), in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) being untrue and betraying me.
<p/>--how shall I say?--an instrument, a machine for his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) happiness, and that for my whole life, my whole life, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) may see that all his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) life!
<p/>'' I will--I will become nothing but a means for his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) happiness, or That's my decision. Ivan Fyodorovitch fully approves me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) had perhaps intended to express her (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) idea with more dignity, art and naturalness, but her (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) speech was too hurried and crude.
<p/>It was full of youthful impulsiveness, it betrayed that she (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) was still smarting from yesterday's insult, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) pride craved satisfaction.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) was breathless. She (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) felt this herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) face suddenly darkened, an unpleasant look came into her (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) eyes. Alyosha at once saw it and felt a pang of sympathy.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) brother Ivan made it worse by adding: <div class="bookquote">``I've only expressed my own view,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said. '' From any one else, this would have been affected and overstrained, but from you--no.
<p/>Any other woman would have been wrong, but you are right. I don't know how to explain it, but I see that you are absolutely genuine and, therefore, you are right.''
<p/>'' But that's only for the moment. And what does this moment stand for? Nothing but yesterday's insult. '' Madame Hohlakov obviously had not intended to interfere, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not refrain from this very just comment.
<p/>Quite so, quite so,'' cried Ivan, with peculiar eagerness, obviously annoyed at being interrupted, <div class="bookquote">``in any one else this moment would be only due to yesterday's impression and would be only a moment.
<p/>What for any one else would be only a promise is for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) an everlasting burdensome, grim perhaps, but unflagging duty.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>But with Katerina Ivanovna's character, that moment will last all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) life. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) will be sustained by the feeling of this duty being fulfilled.
<p/>Your life, Katerina Ivanovna, will henceforth be spent in painful brooding over your own feelings, your own heroism, and your own suffering; but in the end that suffering will be softened and will pass into sweet contemplation of the fulfillment of a bold and proud design.
<p/>And the consciousness of it will at last be a source of complete satisfaction and will make you resigned to everything else.
<p/>This was unmistakably said with some malice and obviously with intention; even perhaps with no desire to conceal that he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) spoke ironically and with intention.
<p/>Yes, proud it certainly is, and desperate in any case, but a triumph for you. '' '' Oh, dear, how mistaken it all is!''
<p/>Madame Hohlakov cried again. '' Alexey Fyodorovitch, you speak. I want dreadfully to know what you will say!'' cried Katerina Ivanovna, and burst into tears.
<p/>Alyosha got up from the sofa. '' It's nothing, nothing! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) went on through her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) tears. '' I'm upset, I didn't sleep last night.
<p/>But by the side of two such friends as you and your brother I still feel strong-- for I know--you two will never desert me.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Unluckily I am obliged to return to Moscow--perhaps to-morrow--and to leave you for a long time-- And, unluckily, it's unavoidable,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan said suddenly.
<p/>'' To-morrow--to Moscow! '' her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) face was suddenly contorted; <div class="bookquote">``but--but, dear me, how fortunate! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) cried in a voice suddenly changed.
<p/>Instead of a poor, insulted girl, weeping in a sort of <div class="bookquote">``laceration,''  (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) saw a woman completely self- possessed and even exceedingly pleased, as though something agreeable had just happened.
<p/>In one instant there was no trace left of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tears. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) underwent an instantaneous transformation, which amazed Alyosha. '' Oh, not fortunate that I am losing you, of course not,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) corrected herself suddenly, with a charming society smile.
<p/>'' Such a friend as you are could not suppose that. I am only too unhappy at losing you. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rushed impulsively at Ivan, and seizing both his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hands, pressed them warmly.
<p/>But what is fortunate is that you will be able in Moscow to see auntie and Agafya and to tell them all the horror of my present position.
<p/>You can't think how wretched I was yesterday and this morning, wondering how I could write them that dreadful letter--for one can never tell such things in a letter...
<p/>'' You can speak with complete openness to Agafya, but spare dear auntie. You will know how to do that. Now it will be easy for me to write, for you will see them and explain everything.
<p/>Oh, how glad I am! But I am only glad of that, believe me. Of course, no one can take your place....
<p/>I will run at once to write the letter,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) finished suddenly, and took a step as though to go out of the room.
<p/>'' And what about Alyosha and his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) opinion, which you were so desperately anxious to hear? '' cried Madame Hohlakov. There was a sarcastic, angry note in her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) voice.
<p/>I had not forgotten that,'' cried Katerina Ivanovna, coming to a sudden standstill, <div class="bookquote">``and why are you so antagonistic at such a moment?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Katerina</b></font>)</div>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) added, with warm and bitter reproachfulness. '' What I said, I repeat. I must have his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) opinion. More than that, I must have his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) decision!
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) says, so it shall be. You see how anxious I am for your words, Alexey Fyodorovitch.... But what's the matter?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I couldn't have believed it. I can't understand it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha cried suddenly in distress. '' What? What?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is going to Moscow, and you cry out that you are glad.
<p/>You said that on purpose! And you begin explaining that you are not glad of that but sorry to be--losing a friend.
<p/>But that was acting, too --you were playing a part--as in a theater!'' <div class="bookquote">``In a theater? What? What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Katerina</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Katerina Ivanovna, profoundly astonished, flushing crimson, and frowning.
<p/>Though you assure him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) you are sorry to lose a friend in him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), you persist in telling him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) face that it's fortunate he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is going,'' said Alyosha breathlessly.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was standing at the table and did not sit down. '' What are you talking about? I don't understand.
<p/>I know I am not saying it properly, but I'll say it all the same,'' Alyosha went on in the same shaking and broken voice.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't understand myself.... I seemed to see in a flash ... ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>What I see is that perhaps you don't love Dmitri at all ... and never have, from the beginning....
<p/>I really don't know how I dare to say all this, but somebody must tell the truth ... for nobody here will tell the truth.
<p/>And Dmitri, too, has never loved you ... and only esteems you... '' '' What truth?'' cried Katerina Ivanovna, and there was an hysterical ring in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) voice.
<p/>'' I'll tell you,'' Alyosha went on with desperate haste, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) were jumping from the top of a house.
<p/>Call Dmitri; I will fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)--and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) come here and take your hand and take Ivan's and join your hands.
<p/>For you're torturing Ivan, simply because you love him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)--and torturing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), because you love Dmitri through `self-laceration'--with an unreal love--because you've persuaded yourself.
<p/>'' '' Alyosha broke off and was silent. '' You ... you ... you are a little religious idiot--that's what you are!''
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna snapped. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) face was white and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) lips were moving with anger. Ivan suddenly laughed and got up. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hat was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hand.
<p/>You are mistaken, my good Alyosha,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said, with an expression Alyosha had never seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face before--an expression of youthful sincerity and strong, irresistibly frank feeling.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) has known all the time that I cared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)--though I never said a word of my love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) knew,
<p/>'' '' Katerina Ivanovna has never cared for me! but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) didn't care for me. I have never been her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) friend either, not for one moment; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is too proud to need my friendship.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) revenged with me and on me all the insults which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) has been continually receiving from Dmitri ever since their first meeting.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) kept me at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) side as a means of revenge. For even that first meeting has rankled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) heart as an insult--that's what her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) heart is like!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) has talked to me of nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) love for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>). I am going now; but, believe me, Katerina Ivanovna, you really love him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>).
<p/>And the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) insults you, the more you love him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)--that's your `laceration.' You love him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) is; you love him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) for insulting you.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) reformed, you'd give him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) up at once and cease to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>). But you need him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) so as to contemplate continually your heroic fidelity and to reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) for infidelity.
<p/>And it all comes from your pride. Oh, there's a great deal of humiliation and self-abasement about it, but it all comes from pride....
<p/>I know that I ought not to say this, that it would be more dignified on my part simply to leave you, and it would be less offensive for you.
<p/>I am too young and I've loved you too much. But I am going far away, and shall never come back....
<p/>It is for ever. I don't want to sit beside a `laceration.'... But I don't know how to speak now. I've said everything....
<p/>Good-by, Katerina Ivanovna; you can't be angry with me, for I am a hundred times more severely punished than you, if only by the fact that I shall never see you again.
<p/>Good-by! I don't want your hand. You have tortured me too deliberately for me to be able to forgive you at this moment.
<p/>Den Dank, Dame, begehr ich nicht,' '' he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) added, with a forced smile, showing, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) could read Schiller, and read him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) by heart--which Alyosha would never have believed.
<p/>I shall forgive you later, but now I don't want your hand. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) went out of the room without saying good-by even to his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) hostess, Madame Hohlakov.
<p/>Alyosha clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">``Ivan!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) cried desperately after him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Come back, Ivan! No, nothing will induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) to come back now!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) cried again, regretfully realizing it; <div class="bookquote">``but it's my fault, my fault. I began it! Ivan spoke angrily, wrongly. Unjustly and angrily.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) must come back here, come back,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Alyosha kept exclaiming frantically. Katerina Ivanovna went suddenly into the next room. '' You have done no harm.
<p/>You behaved beautifully, like an angel,'' Madame Hohlakov whispered rapidly and ecstatically to Alyosha. '' I will do my utmost to prevent Ivan Fyodorovitch from going.
<p/>'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) face beamed with delight, to the great distress of Alyosha, but Katerina Ivanovna suddenly returned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had two hundred-rouble notes in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hand.
<p/>I have a great favor to ask of you, Alexey Fyodorovitch,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) began, addressing Alyosha with an apparently calm and even voice, as though nothing had happened.
<p/>A week--yes, I think it was a week ago--Dmitri Fyodorovitch was guilty of a hasty and unjust action--a very ugly action.
<p/>There is a low tavern here, and in it he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) met that discharged officer, that captain, whom your father used to employ in some business.
<p/>Dmitri Fyodorovitch somehow lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) temper with this captain, seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) by the beard and dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) out into the street and for some distance along it, in that insulting fashion.
<p/>And I am told that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) son, a boy, quite a child, who is at the school here, saw it and ran beside them crying and begging for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) father, appealing to every one to defend him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), while every one laughed.
<p/>You must forgive me, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I cannot think without indignation of that disgraceful action of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) ... one of those actions of which only Dmitri Fyodorovitch would be capable in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) anger ... and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) passions!
<p/>'' '' I can't describe it even.... I can't find my words. I've made inquiries about his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) victim, and find he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is quite a poor man.
<p/>And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) has sunk into terrible destitution, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) family--an unhappy family of sick children, and, I believe, an insane wife.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) has been living here a long time; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) used to work as a copying clerk, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is getting nothing.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) name is Snegiryov. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) did something wrong in the army and was discharged. I can't tell you what. I thought if you ... that is I thought ...
<p/>You see, I wanted to ask you, my dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, to go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), to find some excuse to go to them--
<p/>oh, goodness, how badly I explain it!--and delicately, carefully, as only you know how to'' -LRB-Alyosha blushed-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``manage to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) this assistance, these two hundred roubles.
<p/>I don't know. I am so confused. I mean to that captain-- He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) will be sure to take it.... I mean, persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) to take it....
<p/>You see it's not by way of compensation to prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) from taking proceedings -LRB-for I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) meant to-RRB-, but simply a token of sympathy, of a desire to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) from me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch's betrothed, not from himself....
<p/>Or, rather, what do I mean? But you know.... I would go myself, but you'll know how to do it ever so much better.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) lives in Lake Street, in the house of a woman called Kalmikov.... For God's sake, Alexey Fyodorovitch, do it for me, and now ... now I am rather ... tired.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned and disappeared behind the portičre so quickly that Alyosha had not time to utter a word, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) wanted to speak.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) longed to beg her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pardon, to blame himself, to say something, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) heart was full and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) could not bear to go out of the room without it.
<p/>Good- by! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>But Madame Hohlakov took him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) by the hand and drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) along with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). In the hall she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) again as before.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is proud, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is struggling with herself; but kind, charming, generous,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) exclaimed, in a half-whisper. '' Oh, how I love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), especially sometimes, and how glad I am again of everything!
<p/>Dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, you didn't know, but I must tell you, that we all, all--both her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) aunts, I and all of us, Lise, even--have been hoping and praying for nothing for the last month but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) may give up your favorite Dmitri, who takes no notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) and does not care for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>), and may marry Ivan Fyodorovitch--such an excellent and cultivated young man, who loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) more than anything in the world.
<p/>We are in a regular plot to bring it about, and I am even staying on here perhaps on that account.''
<p/>'' But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) has been crying--she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) has been wounded again,'' cried Alyosha. '' Never trust a woman's tears, Alexey Fyodorovitch. I am never for the women in such cases.
<p/>I am always on the side of the men.'' <div class="bookquote">``Mamma, you are spoiling him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lise/LISE</b></font>)</div>Lise's little voice cried from behind the door.
<p/>I am horribly to blame,'' Alyosha repeated unconsoled, hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) hands in an agony of remorse for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) indiscretion.
<p/>'' No, it was all my fault. '' Quite the contrary; you behaved like an angel, like an angel. I am ready to say so a thousand times over.''
<p/>I somehow fancied all at once,'' Alyosha went on as though he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) had not heard Lise, ``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) loved Ivan, and so I said that stupid thing...
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, how has he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) behaved like an angel? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Lise's voice was heard again. '' What will happen now? '' <div class="bookquote">``To whom, to whom?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lise/LISE</b></font>)</div>cried Lise.
<p/>'' Mamma, you really want to be the death of me. I ask you and you don't answer. '' At the moment the maid ran in.
<p/>'' Katerina Ivanovna is ill.... She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is crying, struggling ... hysterics. '' '' What is the matter? '' cried Lise, in a tone of real anxiety.
<p/>'' Mamma, I shall be having hysterics, and not she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>)!'' <div class="bookquote">``Lise, for mercy's sake, don't scream, don't persecute me. At your age one can't know everything that grown-up people know.
<p/>I'll come and tell you everything you ought to know. Oh, mercy on us! I am coming, I am coming.... Hysterics is a good sign, Alexey Fyodorovitch; it's an excellent thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) is hysterical.
<p/>That's just as it ought to be. In such cases I am always against the woman, against all these feminine tears and hysterics.
<p/>Run and say, Yulia, that I'll fly to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). As for Ivan Fyodorovitch's going away like that, it's her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own fault.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) won't go away. Lise, for mercy's sake, don't scream! Oh, yes; you are not screaming. It's I am screaming.
<p/>Did you notice, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how young, how young Ivan Fyodorovitch was just now when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) went out, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) said all that and went out?
<p/>I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was so learned, such a savant , and all of a sudden he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) behaved so warmly, openly, and youthfully, with such youthful inexperience, and it was all so fine, like you....
<p/>Forgive your mamma; but I am delighted, delighted, delighted! And the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) repeated that German verse, it was just like you!
<p/>But I must fly, I must fly! Alexey Fyodorovitch, make haste to carry out her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) commission, and then make haste back.
<p/>Lise, do you want anything now? For mercy's sake, don't keep Alexey Fyodorovitch a minute. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) will come back to you at once.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Hohlakov</b></font>)</div>Madame Hohlakov at last ran off. Before leaving, Alyosha would have opened the door to see Lise. '' On no account,'' cried Lise.
<p/>'' On no account now. Speak through the door. How have you come to be an angel? That's the only thing I want to know.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``For an awful piece of stupidity, Lise! Good-by!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't dare to go away like that!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lise/LISE</b></font>)</div>Lise was beginning. '' Lise, I have a real sorrow!
<p/>I'll be back directly, but I have a great, great sorrow! '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) ran out of the room. Chapter VI.
<p/>A Laceration In The Cottage He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) certainly was really grieved in a way he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) had seldom been before. He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) had rushed in like a fool, and meddled in what?
<p/>In a love-affair. '' But what do I know about it? What can I tell about such things? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) repeated to himself for the hundredth time, flushing crimson.
<p/>'' Oh, being ashamed would be nothing; shame is only the punishment I deserve. The trouble is I shall certainly have caused more unhappiness....
<p/>And Father Zossima sent me to reconcile and bring them together. Is this the way to bring them together? '' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) suddenly remembered how he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) had tried to join their hands, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) felt fearfully ashamed again.
<p/>Though I acted quite sincerely, I must be more sensible in the future,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) concluded suddenly, and did not even smile at his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) conclusion.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna's commission took him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) to Lake Street, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) brother Dmitri lived close by, in a turning out of Lake Street.
<p/>Alyosha decided to go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) in any case before going to the captain, though he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had a presentiment that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) would not find his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) brother.
<p/>Time was passing: the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) dying elder had not left Alyosha for one minute from the time he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) set off from the monastery.
<p/>There was one point which interested him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) particularly about Katerina Ivanovna's commission; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had mentioned the captain's son, the little schoolboy who had run beside his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) father crying, the idea had at once struck Alyosha that this must be the schoolboy who had bitten his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) finger when he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>), Alyosha, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) had done to hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>).
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) suspected that he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) would intentionally keep out of his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) way now, but he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) must find him (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) anyhow. Now Alyosha felt practically certain of this, though he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) could not have said why.
<p/>Thinking of another subject was a relief, and he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) resolved to think no more about the <div class="bookquote">``mischief''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) had done, and not to torture himself with remorse, but to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) had to do, let come what would.
<p/>Turning to the street where Dmitri lodged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) felt hungry, and taking out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) pocket the roll he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had brought from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) father's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) ate it.
<p/>At that thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was completely comforted. It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) feel stronger. Dmitri was not at home. The people of the house, an old cabinet-maker, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) son, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) old wife, looked with positive suspicion at Alyosha.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) hasn't slept here for the last three nights. Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) has gone away,'' the old man said in answer to Alyosha's persistent inquiries.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were not at Grushenka's or in hiding at Foma's -LRB-Alyosha spoke so freely on purpose-RRB-, all three looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in alarm.
<p/>Alyosha saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was answering in accordance with instructions. '' They are fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), they are doing their best for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),'' thought Alyosha.
<p/>It was a decrepit little house, sunk on one side, with three windows looking into the street, and with a muddy yard, in the middle of which stood a solitary cow.
<p/>'' That's good. '' At last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found the house in Lake Street. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crossed the yard and found the door opening into the passage.
<p/>On the left of the passage lived the old woman of the house with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) old daughter. Both seemed to be deaf.
<p/>In answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) repeated inquiry for the captain, one of them at last understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was asking for their lodgers, and pointed to a door across the passage.
<p/>Alyosha had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand on the iron latch to open the door, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was struck by the strange hush within.
<p/>The captain's lodging turned out to be a simple cottage room. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew from Katerina Ivanovna's words that the man had a family.
<p/>Either they are all asleep or perhaps they have heard me coming and are waiting for me to open the door.
<p/>'' I'd better knock first,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knocked. An answer came, but not at once, after an interval of perhaps ten seconds.
<p/>'' Who's there?'' shouted some one in a loud and very angry voice. Then Alyosha opened the door and crossed the threshold.
<p/>Though it was large, it was cumbered up with domestic belongings of all sorts, and there were several people in it.
<p/>From the stove to the window on the left was a string running across the room, and on it there were rags hanging.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found himself in a regular peasant's room. On the left was a large Russian stove. There was a bedstead against the wall on each side, right and left, covered with knitted quilts.
<p/>On the one on the left was a pyramid of four print-covered pillows, each smaller than the one beneath. On the other there was only one very small pillow.
<p/>The opposite corner was screened off by a curtain or a sheet hung on a string. Behind this curtain could be seen a bed made up on a bench and a chair.
<p/>The three windows, which consisted each of four tiny greenish mildewy panes, gave little light, and were close shut, so that the room was not very light and rather stuffy.
<p/>On the table was a frying-pan with the remains of some fried eggs, a half-eaten piece of bread, and a small bottle with a few drops of vodka.
<p/>The rough square table of plain wood had been moved into the middle window. A woman of genteel appearance, wearing a cotton gown, was sitting on a chair by the bed on the left.
<p/>But what struck Alyosha most was the expression in the poor woman's eyes--a look of surprised inquiry and yet of haughty pride.
<p/>And while he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) big brown eyes moved from one speaker to the other with the same haughty and questioning expression.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face was thin and yellow, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sunken cheeks betrayed at the first glance that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was ill. Beside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at the window stood a young girl, rather plain, with scanty reddish hair, poorly but very neatly dressed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a very sad sight, a young girl of about twenty, but hunchback and crippled <div class="bookquote">``with withered legs,''  (<font color='red'><b>hunchback</b></font>)</div>as Alyosha was told afterwards.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked disdainfully at Alyosha as he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) came in. Beside the other bed was sitting another female figure. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) crutches stood in the corner close by.
<p/>The strikingly beautiful and gentle eyes of this poor girl looked with mild serenity at Alyosha. A man of forty-five was sitting at the table, finishing the fried eggs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had reddish hair and a scanty light-colored beard, very much like a wisp of tow -LRB-this comparison and the phrase <div class="bookquote">``a wisp of tow''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>flashed at once into Alyosha's mind for some reason, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered it afterwards-RRB-.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was spare, small and weakly built. It was obviously this gentleman who had shouted to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), as there was no other man in the room.
<p/>But when Alyosha went in, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leapt up from the bench on which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sitting, and, hastily wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth with a ragged napkin, darted up to Alyosha.
<p/>'' It's a monk come to beg for the monastery. A nice place to come to! '' the girl standing in the left corner said aloud.
<p/>The man spun round instantly towards her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and answered her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in an excited and breaking voice: <div class="bookquote">``No, Varvara, you are wrong.
<p/>Allow me to ask,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned again to Alyosha, <div class="bookquote">``what has brought you to--our retreat?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha looked attentively at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It was the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>There was something angular, flurried and irritable about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had obviously just been drinking, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not drunk. There was extraordinary impudence in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expression, and yet, strange to say, at the same time there was fear.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked like a man who had long been kept in subjection and had submitted to it, and now had suddenly turned and was trying to assert himself.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words and in the intonation of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shrill voice there was a sort of crazy humor, at times spiteful and at times cringing, and continually shifting from one tone to another.
<p/>The question about <div class="bookquote">``our retreat''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had asked as it were quivering all over, rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, and skipping up so close to Alyosha that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) instinctively drew back a step.
<p/>Or, better still, like a man who wants dreadfully to hit you but is horribly afraid you will hit him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was dressed in a very shabby dark cotton coat, patched and spotted.
<p/>They were so crumpled and so short that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had grown out of them like a boy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore checked trousers of an extremely light color, long out of fashion, and of very thin material. '' I am Alexey Karamazov,'' Alyosha began in reply.
<p/>I quite understand that, sir,'' the gentleman snapped out at once to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knew who he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was already.
<p/>'' '' I am Captain Snegiryov, sir, but I am still desirous to know precisely what has led you-- '' ''
<p/>Oh, I've come for nothing special. I wanted to have a word with you--if only you allow me.'' <div class="bookquote">``In that case, here is a chair, sir; kindly be seated.
<p/>That's what they used to say in the old comedies, `kindly be seated,' ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and with a rapid gesture he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) seized an empty chair -LRB-it was a rough wooden chair, not upholstered-RRB- and set it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) almost in the middle of the room; then, taking another similar chair for himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) sat down facing Alyosha, so close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) that their knees almost touched.
<p/>Nikolay Ilyitch Snegiryov, sir, formerly a captain in the Russian infantry, put to shame for his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) vices, but still a captain.
<p/>Though I might not be one now for the way I talk; for the last half of my life I've learnt to say `sir.'
<p/>'' It's a word you use when you've come down in the world.'' '' That's very true,'' smiled Alyosha. '' But is it used involuntarily or on purpose?''
<p/>I didn't use the word `sir' all my life, but as soon as I sank into low water I began to say `sir.'
<p/>I see you are interested in contemporary questions, but how can I have excited your curiosity, living as I do in surroundings impossible for the exercise of hospitality?''
<p/>'' As God's above, it's involuntary, and I usen't to use it! It's the work of a higher power. <div class="bookquote">``I've come--about that business.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``About what business? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>the captain interrupted impatiently. '' About your meeting with my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch,'' Alyosha blurted out awkwardly.
<p/>'' What meeting, sir? You don't mean that meeting? About my `wisp of tow,' then?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) moved closer so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) knees positively knocked against Alyosha.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is come to complain of me, father!'' cried a voice familiar to Alyosha--the voice of the schoolboy--from behind the curtain.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) lips were strangely compressed like a thread. '' What wisp of tow? '' muttered Alyosha. '' '' I bit his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) finger just now.
<p/>The curtain was pulled, and Alyosha saw his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) assailant lying on a little bed made up on the bench and the chair in the corner under the ikons.
<p/>'' The boy lay covered by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) coat and an old wadded quilt. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was evidently unwell, and, judging by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) glittering eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was in a fever.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked at Alyosha without fear, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was at home and could not be touched. <div class="bookquote">``What! Did he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bite your finger?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The captain</b></font>)</div>The captain jumped up from his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) chair. '' Was it your finger he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) bit?'' '' Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was throwing stones with other schoolboys.
<p/>There were six of them against him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) alone. I went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) threw a stone at me and then another at my head.
<p/>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) what I had done to him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>). And then he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) rushed at me and bit my finger badly , I don't know why.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll thrash him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), sir, at once--this minute!''  (<font color='red'><b>The captain</b></font>)</div>The captain jumped up from his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) seat. '' But I am not complaining at all, I am simply telling you ...
<p/>I don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) to be thrashed. Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) seems to be ill.'' '' And do you suppose I'd thrash him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)?
<p/>That I'd take my Ilusha and thrash him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) before you for your satisfaction? Would you like it done at once, sir?
<p/>I am sorry about your finger, sir; but instead of thrashing Ilusha, would you like me to chop off my four fingers with this knife here before your eyes to satisfy your just wrath?
<p/>'' said the captain, suddenly turning to Alyosha, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) were going to attack him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>). '' I should think four fingers would be enough to satisfy your thirst for vengeance.
<p/>You won't ask for the fifth one too?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) stopped short with a catch in his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) throat. Every feature in his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) face was twitching and working; he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) looked extremely defiant.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was in a sort of frenzy. '' I think I understand it all now,'' said Alyosha gently and sorrowfully, still keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) seat.
<p/>So your boy is a good boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) loves his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) father, and he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) attacked me as the brother of your assailant....
<p/>But my brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch regrets his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) action, I know that, and if only it is possible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) to come to you, or better still, to meet you in that same place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) will ask your forgiveness before every one--if you wish it.''
<p/>'' Now I understand it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) repeated thoughtfully. '' <div class="bookquote">``After pulling out my beard, you mean, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) will ask my forgiveness?
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) thinks that will be a satisfactory finish, doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, no! On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) will do anything you like and in any way you like.''
<p/>So if I were to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) highness to go down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) knees before me in that very tavern--`The Metropolis' it's called--or in the market-place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) would do it?''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) would even go down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) knees.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' You've pierced me to the heart, sir. Touched me to tears and pierced me to the heart!
<p/>I am only too sensible of your brother's generosity. Allow me to introduce my family, my two daughters and my son--my litter.
<p/>If I die, who will care for them, and while I live who but they will care for a wretch like me?
<p/>That's a great thing the Lord has ordained for every man of my sort, sir. For there must be some one able to love even a man like me.''
<p/>Some idiot comes in, and you put us to shame!'' cried the girl by the window, suddenly turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father with a disdainful and contemptuous air.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, that's perfectly true! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Alyosha. '' Oh, do leave off playing the fool! '' Wait a little, Varvara! '' cried her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father, speaking peremptorily but looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) quite approvingly.
<p/>'' That's her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) character,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) said, addressing Alyosha again. '' And in all nature there was naught That could find favor in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) eyes-- or rather in the feminine
<p/>: that could find favor in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes. But now let me present you to my wife, Arina Petrovna. She (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovna</b></font>) is crippled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovna</b></font>) is forty- three; she (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovna</b></font>) can move, but very little.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Petrovna</b></font>) is of humble origin. Arina Petrovna, compose your countenance. This is Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov. Get up, Alexey Fyodorovitch. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) by the hand and with unexpected force pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) up.
<p/>'' You must stand up to be introduced to a lady. It's not the Karamazov, mamma, who ... h'm ... etcetera, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) brother, radiant with modest virtues.
<p/>Come, Arina Petrovna, come, mamma, first your hand to be kissed. '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) wife's hand respectfully and even tenderly.
<p/>The girl at the window turned her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back indignantly on the scene; an expression of extraordinary cordiality came over the haughtily inquiring face of the woman.
<p/>'' Good morning! Sit down, Mr. Tchernomazov,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. '' Karamazov, mamma, Karamazov. We are of humble origin,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) whispered again.
<p/>'' Well, Karamazov, or whatever it is, but I always think of Tchernomazov.... Sit down. Why has he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) pulled you up?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) calls me crippled, but I am not, only my legs are swollen like barrels, and I am shriveled up myself.
<p/>Once I used to be so fat, but now it's as though I had swallowed a needle.'' <div class="bookquote">``We are of humble origin,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>the captain muttered again.
<p/>the hunchback girl, who had till then been silent on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chair, said suddenly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) handkerchief.
<p/>'' Oh, father, father! '' <div class="bookquote">``Buffoon!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>blurted out the girl at the window. '' Have you heard our news?'' said the mother, pointing at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughters.
<p/>'' It's like clouds coming over; the clouds pass and we have music again. When we were with the army, we used to have many such guests.
<p/>The deacon's wife used to come then and say, `Alexandr Alexandrovitch is a man of the noblest heart, but Nastasya Petrovna,' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would say, `is of the brood of hell.' '
<p/>I don't mean to make any comparisons; every one to their taste. Well,' I said, `that's a matter of taste; but you are a little spitfire.' '
<p/>And you want keeping in your place,' says she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). ' You black sword,' said I, `who asked you to teach me?' '
<p/>But my breath,' says she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), `is clean, and yours is unclean.' ' You ask all the officers whether my breath is unclean.'
<p/>Not long ago I was sitting here as I am now, when I saw that very general come in who came here for Easter, and I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>): `Your Excellency,' said I, `can a lady's breath be unpleasant?' '
<p/>Yes,' he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) answered; `you ought to open a window- pane or open the door, for the air is not fresh here.'
<p/>And ever since then I had it in my mind. And they all go on like that! And what is my breath to them?
<p/>The dead smell worse still! ' I won't spoil the air,' said I, `I'll order some slippers and go away.' My darlings, don't blame your own mother!
<p/>Nikolay Ilyitch, how is it I can't please you? There's only Ilusha who comes home from school and loves me. Yesterday he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brought me an apple.
<p/>Forgive your own mother--forgive a poor lonely creature! Why has my breath become unpleasant to you? '' And the poor mad woman broke into sobs, and tears streamed down her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheeks.
<p/>The captain rushed up to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). '' Mamma, mamma, my dear, give over! You are not lonely. Every one loves you, every one adores you.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) began kissing both her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands again and tenderly stroking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face; taking the dinner-napkin, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) began wiping away her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tears.
<p/>'' Alyosha fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) too had tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) eyes. '' There, you see, you hear? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) turned with a sort of fury to Alyosha, pointing to the poor imbecile.
<p/>'' I see and hear,'' muttered Alyosha. '' Father, father, how can you--with him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)! Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) alone!'' cried the boy, sitting up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) bed and gazing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) father with glowing eyes.
<p/>'' Do give over fooling, showing off your silly antics which never lead to anything! '' shouted Varvara, stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) foot with passion.
<p/>'' Your anger is quite just this time, Varvara, and I'll make haste to satisfy you. Come, put on your cap, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and I'll put on mine.
<p/>We will go out. I have a word to say to you in earnest, but not within these walls. This girl sitting here is my daughter Nina; I forgot to introduce her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) to you.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) is a heavenly angel incarnate ... who has flown down to us mortals,... if you can understand. '' <div class="bookquote">``There he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) is shaking all over, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) is in convulsions!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Varvara</b></font>)</div>Varvara went on indignantly. '' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) there stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) foot at me and calling me a fool just now
<p/>, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) is a heavenly angel incarnate too, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) has good reason to call me so. Come along, Alexey Fyodorovitch, we must make an end.
<p/>And In The Open Air <div class="bookquote">``The air is fresh, but in my apartment it is not so in any sense of the word.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>And, snatching Alyosha's hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) out of the room into the street. Chapter VII. Let us walk slowly, sir.
<p/>I should be glad of your kind interest. '' <div class="bookquote">``I too have something important to say to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>observed Alyosha, <div class="bookquote">``only I don't know how to begin.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>'' To be sure you must have business with me. You would never have looked in upon me without some object.
<p/>And, by the way, about the boy: I could not explain to you in there, but here I will describe that scene to you.
<p/>Unless you come simply to complain of the boy, and that's hardly likely. My tow was thicker a week ago--I mean my beard.
<p/>That's the nickname they give to my beard, the schoolboys most of all. Well, your brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch was pulling me by my beard
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) dragged me out of the tavern into the market-place; at that moment the boys were coming out of school, and with them Ilusha.
<p/>, I'd done nothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was in a towering rage and happened to come upon me. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) saw me in such a state he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) rushed up to me. '
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) caught hold of me, hugged me, tried to pull me away, crying to my assailant, `Let go, let go, it's my father, forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)!'--yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) actually cried `forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).'
<p/>Father,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) cried, `father!' He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) clutched at that hand, that very hand, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) little hands and kissed it.... I remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) little face at that moment, I haven't forgotten it and I never shall!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I swear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Alyosha, <div class="bookquote">``that my brother will express his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) most deep and sincere regret, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has to go down on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knees in that same market-place....
<p/>I'll make him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) or he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is no brother of mine!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aha, then it's only a suggestion! And it does not come from him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) but simply from the generosity of your own warm heart.
<p/>No, in that case allow me to tell you of your brother's highly chivalrous soldierly generosity, for he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did give expression to it at the time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) left off dragging me by my beard and released me: `You are an officer,' he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) said, `and I am an officer, if you can find a decent man to be your second
<p/>You should have said so. send me your challenge. I will give satisfaction, though you are a scoundrel.' That's what he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) said.
<p/>A chivalrous spirit indeed! I retired with Ilusha, and that scene is a family record imprinted for ever on Ilusha's soul.
<p/>No, it's not for us to claim the privileges of noblemen. Judge for yourself. You've just been in our mansion, what did you see there?
<p/>Three ladies, one a cripple and weak-minded, another a cripple and hunchback and the third not crippled but far too clever.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) is a student, dying to get back to Petersburg, to work for the emancipation of the Russian woman on the banks of the Neva.
<p/>I won't speak of Ilusha, he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) is only nine. I am alone in the world, and if I die, what will become of all of them?
<p/>I simply ask you that. And if I challenge him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) kills me on the spot, what then? What will become of them?
<p/>And worse still, if he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) doesn't kill me but only cripples me: I couldn't work, but I should still be a mouth to feed.
<p/>Who would feed it and who would feed them all? Must I take Ilusha from school and send him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) to beg in the streets?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) will beg your forgiveness, he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) will bow down at your feet in the middle of the market-place,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Alyosha again, with glowing eyes.
<p/>I did think of prosecuting him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>),'' the captain went on, <div class="bookquote">``but look in our code, could I get much compensation for a personal injury?
<p/>That's what it means for me to challenge him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) to a duel. It's silly talk and nothing else.''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>'' '' And then Agrafena Alexandrovna-LRB-3-RRB- sent for me and shouted at me: '
<p/>If you proceed against him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), I'll publish it to all the world that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) beat you for your dishonesty, and then you will be prosecuted.'
<p/>I call God to witness whose was the dishonesty and by whose commands I acted, wasn't it by her (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) own and Fyodor Pavlovitch's? '
<p/>Don't dare to dream of it! And what's more,' she (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) went on, `I'll dismiss you for good and you'll never earn another penny from me.
<p/>I'll speak to my merchant too' -LRB-that's what she (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) calls her (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) old man-RRB- `and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will dismiss you!' And if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dismisses me, what can I earn then from any one?
<p/>Those two are all I have to look to, for your Fyodor Pavlovitch has not only given over employing me, for another reason, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) means to make use of papers I've signed to go to law against me.
<p/>And so I kept quiet, and you have seen our retreat. But now let me ask you: did Ilusha hurt your finger much?
<p/>I didn't like to go into it in our mansion before him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, very much, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was in a great fury.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was avenging you on me as a Karamazov, I see that now. But if only you had seen how he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was throwing stones at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) school-fellows!
<p/>It's very dangerous. They might kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>). They are children and stupid. A stone may be thrown and break somebody's head.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' That's just what has happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) has been bruised by a stone to-day. Not on the head but on the chest, just above the heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) came home crying and groaning and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) is ill.'' '' And you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) attacks them first. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) is bitter against them on your account.
<p/>They say he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) stabbed a boy called Krassotkin with a pen-knife not long ago. '' ``I've heard about that too, it's dangerous.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I would advise you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha went on warmly, <div class="bookquote">``not to send him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) to school at all for a time till he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) is calmer ... and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) anger is passed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/>Krassotkin is an official here, we may hear more about it.'' <div class="bookquote">``Anger!''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>the captain repeated, <div class="bookquote">``that's just what it is. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) is a little creature, but it's a mighty anger.
<p/>You don't know all, sir. Let me tell you more. Since that incident all the boys have been teasing him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) about the `wisp of tow.'
<p/>Schoolboys are a merciless race, individually they are angels, but together, especially in schools, they are often merciless. Their teasing has stirred up a gallant spirit in Ilusha.
<p/>An ordinary boy, a weak son, would have submitted, have felt ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father, sir, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stood up for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father against them all.
<p/>For what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) suffered when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) kissed your brother's hand and cried to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) `Forgive father, forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),'--that only God knows--and I, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father.
<p/>For our children--not your children, but ours--the children of the poor gentlemen looked down upon by every one--know what justice means, sir, even at nine years old.
<p/>For his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father and for truth and justice. How should the rich know? They don't explore such depths once in their lives.
<p/>But at that moment in the square when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand, at that moment my Ilusha had grasped all that justice means.
<p/>That truth entered into him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and crushed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) for ever, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>the captain said hotly again with a sort of frenzy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) struck his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) right fist against his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) left palm as though he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) wanted to show how <div class="bookquote">``the truth''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>crushed Ilusha.
<p/>All that day he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) hardly said a word to me, but I noticed he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) kept watching me from the corner, though he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) turned to the window and pretended to be learning his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) lessons.
<p/>'' That very day, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) fell ill with fever and was delirious all night. But I could see his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) mind was not on his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) lessons.
<p/>Next day I got drunk to forget my troubles, sinful man as I am, and I don't remember much. Mamma began crying, too--I am very fond of mamma--well, I spent my last penny drowning my troubles.
<p/>Don't despise me for that, sir, in Russia men who drink are the best. The best men amongst us are the greatest drunkards.
<p/>I lay down and I don't remember about Ilusha, though all that day the boys had been jeering at him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) at school. '
<p/>Wisp of tow,' they shouted, `your father was pulled out of the tavern by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wisp of tow, you ran by and begged forgiveness.' ''
<p/>``On the third day when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came back from school, I saw he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked pale and wretched. ' What is it?'
<p/>I asked. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wouldn't answer. Well, there's no talking in our mansion without mamma and the girls taking part in it.
<p/>What's more, the girls had heard about it the very first day. Varvara had begun snarling. ' You fools and buffoons, can you ever do anything rational?' '
<p/>So in the evening I took the boy out for a walk, for you must know we go for a walk every evening, always the same way, along which we are going now--from our gate to that great stone which lies alone in the road under the hurdle, which marks the beginning of the town pasture.
<p/>Quite so,' I said, `can we ever do anything rational?' For the time I turned it off like that. A beautiful and lonely spot, sir.
<p/>Ilusha and I walked along hand in hand as usual. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has a little hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fingers are thin and cold--he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) suffers with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chest, you know. '
<p/>Father,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), `father!' ' Well?' said I. I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) eyes flashing. ' Father, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) treated you then!' '
<p/>It can't be helped, Ilusha,' I said. ' Don't forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), father, don't forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)! At school they say that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has paid you ten roubles for it.'
<p/>' No, Ilusha,' said I, 'I would not take money from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for anything.' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) began trembling all over, took my hand in both his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and kissed it again. '
<p/>Father,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said, `father, challenge him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) to a duel, at school they say you are a coward and won't challenge him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>), and that you'll accept ten roubles from him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>).'
<p/>' I can't challenge him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) to a duel, Ilusha,' I answered. And I told briefly what I've just told you. He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) listened. '
<p/>Father,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said, `anyway don't forgive it. When I grow up I'll call him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) out myself and kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).' His (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) eyes shone and glowed.
<p/>And of course I am his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) father, and I had to put in a word: ' It's a sin to kill,' I said, `even in a duel.' '
<p/>Father,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said, `when I grow up, I'll knock him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) down, knock the sword out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hand, I'll fall on him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), wave my sword over him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) and say: <div class="bookquote">``I could kill you, but I forgive you, so there!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'
<p/>You see what the workings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) little mind have been during these two days; he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) must have been planning that vengeance all day, and raving about it at night.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) began to come home from school badly beaten, I found out about it the day before yesterday, and you are right
<p/>I heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was standing up against all the class alone and defying them all, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) heart was full of resentment, of bitterness--I was alarmed about him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).
<p/>'' , I won't send him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) to that school any more. We went for another walk. ' Father,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) asked, `are the rich people stronger than any one else on earth?' '
<p/>Yes, Ilusha,' I said, `there are no people on earth stronger than the rich.' ' Father,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said, 'I will get rich, I will become an officer and conquer everybody.
<p/>The Tsar will reward me, I will come back here and then no one will dare--' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tsar</b></font>) was silent and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tsar</b></font>) lips still kept trembling. '
<p/>Father,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said, `what a horrid town this is.' ' Yes, Ilusha,' I said, `it isn't a very nice town.' '
<p/>Father, let us move into another town, a nice one,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said, `where people don't know about us.' ' We will move, we will, Ilusha,' said I, `only I must save up for it.'
<p/>I was glad to be able to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) mind from painful thoughts, and we began to dream of how we would move to another town, how we would buy a horse and cart. '
<p/>We will put mamma and your sisters inside, we will cover them up and we'll walk, you shall have a lift now and then, and I'll walk beside, for we must take care of our horse, we can't all ride.
<p/>That's how we'll go.' He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was enchanted at that, most of all at the thought of having a horse and driving him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).
<p/>For of course a Russian boy is born among horses. We chattered a long while. Thank God, I thought, I have diverted his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mind and comforted him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>'' That was the day before yesterday, in the evening, but last night everything was changed. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had gone to school in the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) came back depressed, terribly depressed.
<p/>In the evening I took him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) by the hand and we went for a walk; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would not talk. There was a wind blowing and no sun, and a feeling of autumn; twilight was coming on.
<p/>We walked along, both of us depressed. ' Well, my boy,' said I, `how about our setting off on our travels?'
<p/>I thought I might bring him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) back to our talk of the day before. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) didn't answer, but I felt his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fingers trembling in my hand.
<p/>Ah, I thought, it's a bad job; there's something fresh. We had reached the stone where we are now. I sat down on the stone.
<p/>And in the air there were lots of kites flapping and whirling. There were as many as thirty in sight. Of course, it's just the season for the kites. '
<p/>Look, Ilusha,' said I, `it's time we got out our last year's kite again. I'll mend it, where have you put it away?'
<p/>My boy made no answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked away and turned sideways to me. And then a gust of wind blew up the sand.
<p/>You know, when children are silent and proud, and try to keep back their tears when they are in great trouble and suddenly break down, their tears fall in streams.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) suddenly fell on me, threw both his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) little arms round my neck and held me tight. With those warm streams of tears, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) suddenly wetted my face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sobbed and shook as though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were in convulsions, and squeezed up against me as I sat on the stone. '
<p/>Father,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) kept crying, `dear father, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) insulted you!' And I sobbed too. We sat shaking in each other's arms. '
<p/>Ilusha,' I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), `Ilusha darling.' No one saw us then. God alone saw us, I hope He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will record it to my credit.
<p/>You must thank your brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch. No, sir, I won't thrash my boy for your satisfaction. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had gone back to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) original tone of resentful buffoonery.
<p/>Alyosha felt though that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) trusted him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and that if there had been some one else in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), Alyosha's place, the man would not have spoken so openly and would not have told what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had just told.
<p/>This encouraged Alyosha, whose heart was trembling on the verge of tears. '' Ah, how I would like to make friends with your boy!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cried. '' If you could arrange it--'' <div class="bookquote">``Certainly, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>muttered the captain. '' But now listen to something quite different!''
<p/>Alyosha went on. '' I have a message for you. That same brother of mine, Dmitri, has insulted his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) betrothed, too, a noble-hearted girl of whom you have probably heard.
<p/>I have a right to tell you of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wrong; I ought to do so, in fact, for hearing of the insult done to you and learning all about your unfortunate position, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) commissioned me at once--just now--to bring you this help from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)--but only from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) alone, not from Dmitri, who has abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>Nor from me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) brother, nor from any one else, but from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), only from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) entreats you to accept her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) help....
<p/>You have both been insulted by the same man. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought of you only when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had just received a similar insult from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--similar in its cruelty, I mean.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) told me to persuade you to take these two hundred roubles from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), as from a sister, knowing that you are in such need.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) comes like a sister to help a brother in misfortune.... No one will know of it, it can give rise to no unjust slander.
<p/>There are the two hundred roubles, and I swear you must take them unless--unless all men are to be enemies on earth!
<p/>But there are brothers even on earth.... You have a generous heart ... you must see that, you must,'' and Alyosha held out two new rainbow-colored hundred-rouble notes.
<p/>They were both standing at the time by the great stone close to the fence, and there was no one near.
<p/>The notes seemed to produce a tremendous impression on the captain. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) started, but at first only from astonishment. Such an outcome of their conversation was the last thing he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) expected.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) took the notes, and for a minute he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was almost unable to answer, quite a new expression came into his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) face.
<p/>Nothing could have been farther from his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) dreams than help from any one--and such a sum! '' That for me? So much money--two hundred roubles!
<p/>Good heavens! Why, I haven't seen so much money for the last four years! Mercy on us! And she (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) is a sister....
<p/>And is that the truth?'' <div class="bookquote">``I swear that all I told you is the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Alyosha. The captain flushed red.
<p/>'' Listen, my dear, listen. If I take it, I shan't be behaving like a scoundrel? In your eyes, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I shan't be a scoundrel?
<p/>You are persuading me to take it, saying that it's a sister sends it, but inwardly, in your heart won't you feel contempt for me if I take it, eh?''
<p/>No, Alexey Fyodorovitch, listen, listen,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) hurried, touching Alyosha with both his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) hands. '' '' No, no, on my salvation I swear I shan't!
<p/>And no one will ever know but me-- I, you and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and one other lady, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) great friend.'' <div class="bookquote">``Never mind the lady!
<p/>Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch, at a moment like this you must listen, for you can't understand what these two hundred roubles mean to me now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was thrown off his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) balance and talked extremely fast, as though afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) would not be allowed to say all he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had to say.
<p/>Besides its being honestly acquired from a `sister,' so highly respected and revered, do you know that now I can look after mamma and Nina, my hunchback angel daughter?
<p/>Doctor Herzenstube came to me in the kindness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) heart and was examining them both for a whole hour. '
<p/>I can make nothing of it,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) prescribed a mineral water which is kept at a chemist's here.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The fellow</b></font>)</div>The poor fellow went on rising gradually into a sort of incoherent, almost wild enthusiasm. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said it would be sure to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) good, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ordered baths, too, with some medicine in them.
<p/>The mineral water costs thirty copecks, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>)'d need to drink forty bottles perhaps ; so I took the prescription and laid it on the shelf under the ikons, and there it lies.
<p/>But how can we carry out such a cure in our mansion, without servants, without help, without a bath, and without water?
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ordered hot baths for Nina with something dissolved in them, morning and evening. Nina is rheumatic all over, I don't think I told you that.
<p/>All her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) right side aches at night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) is in agony, and, would you believe it, the angel bears it without groaning for fear of waking us.
<p/>I am not worth it, I am taking it from you, I am a burden on you,' that's what her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) angel eyes try to express.
<p/>We eat what we can get, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>)'ll only take the leavings, what you'd scarcely give to a dog. ' We wait on her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) doesn't like it. '
<p/>I am a useless cripple, no good to any one.' As though she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) were not worth it, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) is the saving of all of us with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) angelic sweetness.
<p/>Without her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>), without her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) gentle word it would be hell among us! She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) softens even Varvara. And don't judge Varvara harshly either, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) is an angel too, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>), too, has suffered wrong.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) came to us for the summer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) brought sixteen roubles she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) had earned by lessons and saved up, to go back with to Petersburg in September, that is now.
<p/>But we took her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) money and lived on it, so now she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) has nothing to go back with. Though indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) couldn't go back, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) has to work for us like a slave.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) is like an overdriven horse with all of us on her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) waits on us all, mends and washes, sweeps the floor, puts mamma to bed.
<p/>And now I can get a servant with this money, you understand, Alexey Fyodorovitch, I can get medicines for the dear creatures, I can send my student to Petersburg, I can buy beef, I can feed them properly.
<p/>Alyosha was delighted that he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) such happiness and that the poor fellow had consented to be made happy.
<p/>And mamma is capricious and tearful and insane! Good Lord, but it's a dream! '' <div class="bookquote">``Stay, Alexey Fyodorovitch, stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>the captain began to talk with frenzied rapidity, carried away by a new day-dream.
<p/>We will buy a horse and cart, a black horse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) insists on its being black, and we will set off as we pretended the other day.
<p/>I have an old friend, a lawyer in K. province, and I heard through a trustworthy man that if I were to go he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d give me a place as clerk in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) office, so, who knows, maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would.
<p/>'' Do you know that Ilusha and I will perhaps really carry out our dream. So I'd just put mamma and Nina in the cart, and Ilusha could drive, and I'd walk, I'd walk
<p/>Why, if I only succeed in getting one debt paid that's owing me, I should have perhaps enough for that too!''
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna will send you as much more as you need, and you know, I have money too, take what you want, as you would from a brother, from a friend, you can give it back later...
<p/>... <div class="bookquote">``There would be enough!''  (<font color='red'><b>a friend</b></font>)</div>cried Alyosha. '' -LRB-You'll get rich, you'll get rich!-RRB- And you know you couldn't have a better idea than to move to another province!
<p/>It would be the saving of you, especially of your boy--and you ought to go quickly, before the winter, before the cold.
<p/>You must write to us when you are there, and we will always be brothers.... No, it's not a dream!'' Alyosha could have hugged him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was so pleased.
<p/>But glancing at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stopped short. The man was standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) neck outstretched and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lips protruding, with a pale and frenzied face.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lips were moving as though trying to articulate something; no sound came, but still his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lips moved. It was uncanny.
<p/>I ... you,'' muttered the captain, faltering, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) with a strange, wild, fixed stare, and an air of desperate resolution.
<p/>'' What is it?'' asked Alyosha, startled. '' Alexey Fyodorovitch ... At the same time there was a sort of grin on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) lips.
<p/>'' I ... you, sir ... wouldn't you like me to show you a little trick I know? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) murmured, suddenly, in a firm rapid whisper, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) voice no longer faltering.
<p/>'' What trick?'' <div class="bookquote">``A pretty trick,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>whispered the captain. His (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) mouth was twisted on the left side, his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) left eye was screwed up.
<p/>Why, look,'' squealed the captain suddenly, and showing him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) the two notes which he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had been holding by one corner between his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) thumb and forefinger during the conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) crumpled them up savagely and squeezed them tight in his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) right hand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) still stared at Alyosha. '' What is the matter? What trick?'' Alyosha cried, now thoroughly alarmed. '' '' Do you see, do you see?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) shrieked, pale and infuriated. And suddenly flinging up his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) threw the crumpled notes on the sand. ''
<p/>Do you see? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) shrieked again, pointing to them. '' Look there!'' And with wild fury he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) began trampling them under his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) heel, gasping and exclaiming as he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) did so:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So much for your money! So much for your money! So much for your money! So much for your money! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell those who sent you that the wisp of tow does not sell his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) honor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) cried, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) arm in the air.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) turned quickly and began to run; but he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had not run five steps before he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) turned completely round and kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) hand to Alyosha.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) darted back and drew himself up before Alyosha, and his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) whole figure expressed unutterable pride. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) ran another five paces and then turned round for the last time.
<p/>In a tearful, faltering, sobbing voice he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) cried: <div class="bookquote">``What should I say to my boy if I took money from you for our shame?
<p/>This time his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) face was not contorted with laughter, but quivering all over with tears. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) ran on without turning.
<p/>Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) saw that till the very last moment the man had not known he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would crumple up and fling away the notes.
<p/>Alyosha looked after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), inexpressibly grieved. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not turn back. Alyosha knew he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not follow him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and call him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew why.
<p/>They were very much crushed and crumpled, and had been pressed into the sand, but were uninjured and even rustled like new ones when Alyosha unfolded them and smoothed them out.
<p/>After smoothing them out, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) folded them up, put them in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket and went to Katerina Ivanovna to report on the success of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) commission.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was out of sight, Alyosha picked up the two notes. Book V. Pro And Contra Chapter I. The Engagement Madame Hohlakov was again the first to meet Alyosha.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna's hysterics had ended in a fainting fit, and then <div class="bookquote">``a terrible, awful weakness had followed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) lay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eyes turned up and was delirious.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was flustered; something important had happened. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was in a fever. They had sent for Herzenstube; they had sent for the aunts.
<p/>The aunts were already here, but Herzenstube had not yet come. They were all sitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) room, waiting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was unconscious now, and what if it turned to brain fever!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Katerina</b></font>)</div><p/>This is serious, serious,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) added at every word, as though nothing that had happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) before had been serious.
<p/>Madame Hohlakov looked gravely alarmed. '' Alyosha listened with distress, and was beginning to describe his (<font color='blue'><b>aunts</b></font>) adventures, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>aunts</b></font>) at the first words.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had not time to listen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) begged him (<font color='blue'><b>aunts</b></font>) to sit with Lise and wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) there. '' Lise,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) whispered almost in his (<font color='blue'><b>aunts</b></font>) ear, <div class="bookquote">``Lise has greatly surprised me just now, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch.
<p/>Only fancy, as soon as you had gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) began to be truly remorseful for having laughed at you to-day and yesterday, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) was not laughing at you, but only joking.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) touched me, too, and so my heart forgives her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) everything. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) was seriously sorry for it, almost ready to cry, so that I was quite surprised.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) has never been really sorry for laughing at me, but has only made a joke of it. And you know she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) is laughing at me every minute.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) thinks a great deal of your opinion, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and don't take offense or be wounded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) if you can help it.
<p/>But this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) was in earnest. I am never hard upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>)'s such a clever little thing. Would you believe it?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) said just now that you were a friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) childhood, `the greatest friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) childhood'--just think of that--`greatest friend'--and what about me?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) has very strong feelings and memories, and, what's more, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) uses these phrases, most unexpected words, which come out all of a sudden when you least expect them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) spoke lately about a pine-tree, for instance: there used to be a pine-tree standing in our garden in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) early childhood.
<p/>Very likely it's standing there still; so there's no need to speak in the past tense. Pine-trees are not like people, Alexey Fyodorovitch, they don't change quickly. '
<p/>Mamma,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) said, 'I remember this pine-tree as in a dream,' only she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) said something so original about it that I can't repeat it.
<p/>Besides, I've forgotten it. Well, good-by! I am so worried I feel I shall go out of my mind. Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I've been out of my mind twice in my life.
<p/>Go to Lise, cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) up, as you always can so charmingly. Lise,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) cried, going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) door, <div class="bookquote">``here I've brought you Alexey Fyodorovitch, whom you insulted so.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is not at all angry, I assure you; on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is surprised that you could suppose so.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Merci, maman.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) was evidently ashamed of something, and, as people always do in such cases, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) began immediately talking of other things, as though they were of absorbing interest to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) at the moment.
<p/>Mamma has just told me all about the two hundred roubles, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and your taking them to that poor officer ... and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) told me all the awful story of how he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had been insulted ...
<p/>Come in, Alexey Fyodorovitch. '' Alyosha went in. Lise looked rather embarrassed, and at once flushed crimson. '' and you know, although mamma muddles things ... she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) always rushes from one thing to another ...
<p/>I cried when I heard. Well, did you give him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) the money and how is that poor man getting on?'' ''
<p/>The fact is I didn't give it to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and it's a long story,'' answered Alyosha, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), too, could think of nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) regret at having failed, yet Lise saw perfectly well that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), too, looked away, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), too, was trying to talk of other things.
<p/>Alyosha sat down to the table and began to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) story, but at the first words he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) embarrassment and gained the whole of Lise's attention as well.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke with deep feeling, under the influence of the strong impression he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had just received, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) succeeded in telling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) story well and circumstantially.
<p/>In old days in Moscow he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been fond of coming to Lise and describing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) what had just happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had read, or what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) childhood.
<p/>Sometimes they had made day-dreams and woven whole romances together--generally cheerful and amusing ones. Now they both felt suddenly transported to the old days in Moscow, two years before.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finished describing how the luckless man trampled on the money, Lise could not help clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) hands and crying out:
<p/>Lise was extremely touched by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) story. Alyosha described Ilusha with warm feeling. <div class="bookquote">``So you didn't give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the money! So you let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) run away!
<p/>Oh, dear, you ought to have run after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Lise ; it's better I didn't run after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha, getting up from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair and walking thoughtfully across the room.
<p/>'' How so? How is it better? Now they are without food and their case is hopeless?'' <div class="bookquote">``Not hopeless, for the two hundred roubles will still come to them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll take the money to-morrow. To-morrow he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be sure to take it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha, pacing up and down, pondering. ''
<p/>You see, Lise,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on, stopping suddenly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I made one blunder, but that, even that, is all for the best.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>'' What blunder, and why is it for the best?'' <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a man of weak and timorous character; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has suffered so much and is very good-natured.
<p/>I keep wondering why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took offense so suddenly, for I assure you, up to the last minute, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going to trample on the notes.
<p/>And I think now that there was a great deal to offend him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ... and it could not have been otherwise in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position....
<p/>To begin with, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sore at having been so glad of the money in my presence and not having concealed it from me.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been pleased, but not so much; if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not shown it; if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had begun affecting scruples and difficulties, as other people do when they take money, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might still endure to take it.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was too genuinely delighted, and that was mortifying. Ah, Lise, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a good and truthful man--that's the worst of the whole business.
<p/>All the while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talked, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice was so weak, so broken, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talked so fast, so fast, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept laughing such a laugh,
<p/>yes, I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was crying, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so delighted--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talked about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughters--and about the situation he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could get in another town....
<p/>or perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was crying-- And when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had poured out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt ashamed at having shown me his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inmost soul like that.
<p/>What had made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feel most ashamed was that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had given in too soon and accepted me as a friend, you see.
<p/>At first he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) almost flew at me and tried to intimidate me, but as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw the money he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had begun embracing me; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept touching me with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands.
<p/>This must have been how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to feel it all so humiliating, and then I made that blunder, a very important one.
<p/>I suddenly said to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not money enough to move to another town, we would give it to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and, indeed, I myself would give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted out of my own money.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to hate me at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is one of those awfully sensitive poor people. That struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) all at once.
<p/>You know, Lise, it's awfully hard for a man who has been injured, when other people look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as though they were his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) benefactors....
<p/>Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought, did I put myself forward to help him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? I've heard that; Father Zossima told me so. I don't know how to put it, but I have often seen it myself.
<p/>And the worst of it was that though he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) did not know, up to the very last minute, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) would trample on the notes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) had a kind of presentiment of it, I am sure of that.
<p/>And I feel like that myself, too. That's just what made him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) so ecstatic, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) had that presentiment.... And though it's so dreadful, it's all for the best.
<p/>In fact, I believe nothing better could have happened. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, why could nothing better have happened?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lise/LISE</b></font>)</div>cried Lise, looking with great surprise at Alyosha.
<p/>Because if he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) had taken the money, in an hour after getting home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) would be crying with mortification, that's just what would have happened.
<p/>And most likely he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) would have come to me early to-morrow, and perhaps have flung the notes at me and trampled upon them as he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) did just now.
<p/>So now nothing could be easier than to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) accept the two hundred roubles by to-morrow, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) has already vindicated his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) honor, tossed away the money, and trampled it under foot....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) couldn't know when he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) did it that I should bring it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) again to-morrow, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) is in terrible need of that money.
<p/>'' But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) has gone home awfully proud and triumphant, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) knows he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) has `ruined himself.' Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) is proud of himself now, yet even to-day he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>)'ll be thinking what a help he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) has lost.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) will think of it more than ever at night, will dream of it, and by to-morrow morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) may be ready to run to me to ask forgiveness.
<p/>Here, you are a proud man,' I shall say: `you have shown it; but now take the money and forgive us!'
<p/>It's just then that I'll appear. ' And then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will take it!'' Alyosha was carried away with joy as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uttered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last words, <div class="bookquote">``And then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will take it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Lise clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) hands. '' Ah, that's true! I understand that perfectly now. Ah, Alyosha, how do you know all this?
<p/>The great thing now is to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is on an equal footing with us, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) taking money from us,'' Alyosha went on in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) excitement, <div class="bookquote">``and not only on an equal, but even on a higher footing.

<p/>How can it be contempt when we are all like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), when we are all just the same as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is?
<p/>'' I was thinking of that on the way here. For you know we are just the same, no better. If we are better, we should have been just the same in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place....
<p/>I don't know about you, Lise, but I consider that I have a sordid soul in many ways, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul is not sordid; on the contrary, full of fine feeling....
<p/>Do you know, Lise, my elder told me once to care for most people exactly as one would for children, and for some of them as one would for the sick in hospitals.''
<p/>No, Lise, I have no contempt for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Ah, Alexey Fyodorovitch, dear, let us care for people as we would for the sick!''

<p/>I have to make a great confession, I didn't write to you yesterday in joke, but in earnest,'' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) eyes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come here, Alexey Fyodorovitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lise/LISE</b></font>)</div>Lise went on, flushing redder and redder. '' Give me your hand--that's right. It was evident that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) was greatly ashamed of the confession.
<p/>Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) snatched his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) hand and impulsively kissed it three times. '' Ah, Lise, what a good thing!'' cried Alyosha joyfully.
<p/>'' You know, I was perfectly sure you were in earnest.'' <div class="bookquote">``Sure? Upon my word!

<p/>'' I should like to please you always, Lise, but I don't know how to do it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) muttered, blushing too.
<p/>'' Alyosha, dear, you are cold and rude. Do you see? He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) has chosen me as his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) wife and is quite settled about it.

<p/>Alyosha stood still, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>).

'' Oh, what are you doing?
<p/>'' cried Lise. Alyosha was terribly abashed. '' Oh, forgive me if I shouldn't.... Perhaps I'm awfully stupid.... You said I was cold, so I kissed you....
<p/>But I see it was stupid. '' Lise laughed, and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) hands. '' And in that dress!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) ejaculated in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) mirth.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) suddenly ceased laughing and became serious, almost stern. '' Alyosha, we must put off kissing. We are not ready for that yet, and we shall have a long time to wait,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) ended suddenly.

<p/>For you are right and I am not. You are my conscience now.... Listen, Alexey Fyodorovitch, why have you been so sad lately--both yesterday and to-day?

<p/>There was something too mysterious, too subjective in these last words of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), perhaps obscure to himself, but yet torturing him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>And now on the top of it all, my friend, the best man in the world, is going, is leaving the earth!
<p/>But Alyosha did not answer. '' If you knew, Lise, how bound up in soul I am with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)! And then I shall be left alone....

<p/>It means love to the daughter but death to the mother. I might as well be in my grave at once.

<p/>And Alyosha ran downstairs and into the street. Chapter II. Smerdyakov With A Guitar He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had no time to lose indeed.
<p/>Even while he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was saying good-by to Lise, the thought had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) must attempt some stratagem to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) brother Dmitri, who was evidently keeping out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) way.
<p/>It was getting late, nearly three o'clock. Alyosha's whole soul turned to the monastery, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) dying saint, but the necessity of seeing Dmitri outweighed everything.
<p/>What that catastrophe was, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) would say at that moment to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) could perhaps not have said definitely.
<p/>Even if my benefactor must die without me, anyway I won't have to reproach myself all my life with the thought that I might have saved something and did not, but passed by and hastened home.
<p/>The conviction that a great inevitable catastrophe was about to happen grew stronger in Alyosha's mind with every hour. '' If I do as I intend, I shall be following his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) great precept.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) plan was to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) brother Dmitri unawares, to climb over the fence, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had the day before, get into the garden and sit in the summer-house.
<p/>If Dmitri were not there, thought Alyosha, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) would not announce himself to Foma or the women of the house, but would remain hidden in the summer-house, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had to wait there till evening.
<p/>If, as before, Dmitri were lying in wait for Grushenka to come, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) would be very likely to come to the summer-house.
<p/>Alyosha did not, however, give much thought to the details of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) plan, but resolved to act upon it, even if it meant not getting back to the monastery that day.
<p/>Everything happened without hindrance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) climbed over the hurdle almost in the same spot as the day before, and stole into the summer-house unseen.
<p/>The woman of the house and Foma too, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) were here, might be loyal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) brother and obey his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) instructions, and so refuse to let Alyosha come into the garden, or might warn Dmitri that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was being sought and inquired for.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) did not want to be noticed. There was no one in the summer-house. Alyosha sat down and began to wait.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) looked round the summer-house, which somehow struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) as a great deal more ancient than before. Though the day was just as fine as yesterday, it seemed a wretched little place this time.
<p/>There was a circle on the table, left no doubt from the glass of brandy having been spilt the day before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) wondered, for instance, why he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had sat down precisely in the same place as before, why not in the other seat.
<p/>Foolish and irrelevant ideas strayed about his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) mind, as they always do in a time of tedious waiting. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) felt very depressed--depressed by suspense and uncertainty.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had not sat there more than a quarter of an hour, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) suddenly heard the thrum of a guitar somewhere quite close.
<p/>Alyosha suddenly recollected that on coming out of the summer-house the day before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had caught a glimpse of an old green low garden-seat among the bushes on the left, by the fence.
<p/>People were sitting, or had only just sat down, somewhere in the bushes not more than twenty paces away. The people must be sitting on it now.
<p/>A man's voice suddenly began singing in a sugary falsetto, accompanying himself on the guitar: With invincible force I am bound to my dear.
<p/>Who were they? O Lord, have mercy On her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) and on me! On her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) and on me! On her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) and on me!
<p/>Another voice, a woman's, suddenly asked insinuatingly and bashfully, though with mincing affectation: <div class="bookquote">``Why haven't you been to see us for so long, Pavel Fyodorovitch?
<p/>The voice ceased. It was a lackey's tenor and a lackey's song. Why do you always look down upon us?''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>answered a man's voice politely, but with emphatic dignity.
<p/>It was clear that the man had the best of the position, and that the woman was making advances. '' I believe the man must be Smerdyakov,'' thought Alyosha, <div class="bookquote">``from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice.
<p/>And the lady must be the daughter of the house here, who has come from Moscow, the one who wears the dress with a tail and goes to Marfa for soup.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am awfully fond of verses of all kinds, if they rhyme,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>the woman's voice continued. '' Why don't you go on?
<p/>'' The man sang again: What do I care for royal wealth If but my dear one be in health? Lord have mercy On her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and on me!
<p/>On her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and on me! On her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and on me! '' It was even better last time,'' observed the woman's voice.
<p/>'' You sang `If my darling be in health'; it sounded more tender. I suppose you've forgotten to-day. '' <div class="bookquote">``Poetry is rubbish!''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>said Smerdyakov curtly.
<p/>'' Oh, no! I am very fond of poetry.'' <div class="bookquote">``So far as it's poetry, it's essential rubbish. Consider yourself, who ever talks in rhyme?
<p/>And if we were all to talk in rhyme, even though it were decreed by government, we shouldn't say much, should we?
<p/>Poetry is no good, Marya Kondratyevna. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How clever you are! How is it you've gone so deep into everything? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman's voice was more and more insinuating. '' I could have done better than that. I could have known more than that, if it had not been for my destiny from my childhood up.
<p/>I would have shot a man in a duel if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called me names because I am descended from a filthy beggar and have no father.
<p/>And they used to throw it in my teeth in Moscow. It had reached them from here, thanks to Grigory Vassilyevitch.
<p/>Grigory Vassilyevitch blames me for rebelling against my birth, but I would have sanctioned their killing me before I was born that I might not have come into the world at all.
<p/>They used to say in the market, and your mamma too, with great lack of delicacy, set off telling me that her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hair was like a mat on her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) head, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was short of five foot by a wee bit.
<p/>Why talk of a wee bit while she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) might have said 'a little bit,' like every one else? She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) wanted to make it touching, a regular peasant's feeling.
<p/>Can a Russian peasant be said to feel, in comparison with an educated man? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can't be said to have feeling at all, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ignorance.
<p/>From my childhood up when I hear 'a wee bit,' I am ready to burst with rage. I hate all Russia, Marya Kondratyevna.''
<p/>If you'd been a cadet in the army, or a young hussar, you wouldn't have talked like that, but would have drawn your saber to defend all Russia.
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to be a hussar, Marya Kondratyevna, and, what's more, I should like to abolish all soldiers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Napoleon</b></font>)</div><p/>In 1812 there was a great invasion of Russia by Napoleon, first Emperor of the French, father of the present one, and it would have been a good thing if they had conquered us.
<p/>'' And when an enemy comes, who is going to defend us?'' '' There's no need of defense. A clever nation would have conquered a very stupid one and annexed it.
<p/>I wouldn't change a dandy I know of for three young Englishmen,'' observed Marya Kondratyevna tenderly, doubtless accompanying her (<font color='blue'><b>Kondratyevna</b></font>) words with a most languishing glance.
<p/>We should have had quite different institutions.'' <div class="bookquote">``Are they so much better in their own country than we are? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That's as one prefers.''
<p/>'' But you are just like a foreigner--just like a most gentlemanly foreigner. I tell you that, though it makes me bashful.''
<p/>They are swindlers, only there the scoundrel wears polished boots and here he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) grovels in filth and sees no harm in it.
<p/>'' If you care to know, the folks there and ours here are just alike in their vice. The Russian people want thrashing, as Fyodor Pavlovitch said very truly yesterday, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) is mad, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) children.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You said yourself you had such a respect for Ivan Fyodorovitch.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) said I was a stinking lackey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) thinks that I might be unruly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is mistaken there. If I had a certain sum in my pocket, I would have left here long ago. Dmitri Fyodorovitch is lower than any lackey in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) behavior, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) mind, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) poverty.
<p/>I may be only a soup- maker, but with luck I could open a café restaurant in Petrovka, in Moscow, for my cookery is something special, and there's no one in Moscow, except the foreigners, whose cookery is anything special.
<p/>Dmitri Fyodorovitch is a beggar, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) were to challenge the son of the first count in the country, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'d fight him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) doesn't know how to do anything, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is respected by every one. Though in what way is he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) better than I am?
<p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is ever so much stupider than I am. Look at the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) has wasted without any need!'' <div class="bookquote">``It must be lovely, a duel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marya Kondratyevna/Marya</b></font>)</div>Marya Kondratyevna observed suddenly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must be so dreadful and so brave, especially when young officers with pistols in their hands pop at one another for the sake of some lady.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>How so?'' A perfect picture! Ah, if only girls were allowed to look on, I'd give anything to see one!''
<p/>It's all very well when you are firing at some one, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is firing straight in your mug, you must feel pretty silly.
<p/>'' You'd be glad to run away, Marya Kondratyevna. '' <div class="bookquote">``You don't mean you would run away?''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>But Smerdyakov did not deign to reply.
<p/>After a moment's silence the guitar tinkled again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) sang again in the same falsetto: Whatever you may say, I shall go far away.
<p/>Life will be bright and gay In the city far away. I shall not grieve, I shall not grieve at all, I don't intend to grieve at all.
<p/>Then something unexpected happened. Alyosha suddenly sneezed. They were silent. Alyosha got up and walked towards them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) found Smerdyakov dressed up and wearing polished boots, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) hair pomaded, and perhaps curled.
<p/>The guitar lay on the garden-seat. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) companion was the daughter of the house, wearing a light-blue dress with a train two yards long.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was young and would not have been bad-looking, but that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) face was so round and terribly freckled. '' Will my brother Dmitri soon be back?'' asked Alyosha with as much composure as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) could.
<p/>Smerdyakov got up slowly; Marya Kondratyevna rose too. '' How am I to know about Dmitri Fyodorovitch? It's not as if I were his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) keeper,'' answered Smerdyakov quietly, distinctly, and superciliously.
<p/>'' But I simply asked whether you do know?'' Alyosha explained. '' I know nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) whereabouts and don't want to.''
<p/>But my brother told me that you let him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) know all that goes on in the house, and promised to let him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) know when Agrafena Alexandrovna comes.
<p/>'' '' Smerdyakov turned a deliberate, unmoved glance upon him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). '' And how did you get in this time, since the gate was bolted an hour ago?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) asked, looking at Alyosha. '' I came in from the back-alley, over the fence, and went straight to the summer-house.
<p/>I hope you'll forgive me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) added, addressing Marya Kondratyevna. '' I was in a hurry to find my brother.'' ''
<p/>Ach, as though we could take it amiss in you!'' drawled Marya Kondratyevna, flattered by Alyosha's apology. '' For Dmitri Fyodorovitch often goes to the summer-house in that way.
<p/>We don't know he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is here and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is sitting in the summer-house.'' <div class="bookquote">``I am very anxious to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), or to learn from you where he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is now.
<p/>Though I used to come here as a friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>Smerdyakov began again, <div class="bookquote">``Dmitri Fyodorovitch has pestered me in a merciless way even here by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) incessant questions about the master. '
<p/>Believe me, it's on business of great importance to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) never tells us,'' lisped Marya Kondratyevna. '' What news?'
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'ll ask. ' What's going on in there now? Who's coming and going?' and can't I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) something more. Twice already he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'s threatened me with death.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``With death? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha exclaimed in surprise. '' Do you suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'d think much of that, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) temper, which you had a chance of observing yourself yesterday?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) says if I let Agrafena Alexandrovna in and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kondratyevna</b></font>) passes the night there, I'll be the first to suffer for it.
<p/>I am terribly afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), and if I were not even more afraid of doing so, I ought to let the police know.
<p/>God only knows what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) might not do!'' '' His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) honor said to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) the other day, `I'll pound you in a mortar!' '' added Marya Kondratyevna.
<p/>'' Oh, if it's pounding in a mortar, it may be only talk,'' observed Alyosha. '' If I could meet him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), I might speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) about that too.''
<p/>Well, the only thing I can tell you is this,'' said Smerdyakov, as though thinking better of it; <div class="bookquote">``I am here as an old friend and neighbor, and it would be odd if I didn't come.
<p/>On the other hand, Ivan Fyodorovitch sent me first thing this morning to your brother's lodging in Lake Street, without a letter, but with a message to Dmitri Fyodorovitch to go to dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) at the restaurant here, in the market-place.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>I went, but didn't find Dmitri Fyodorovitch at home, though it was eight o'clock. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'s been here, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is quite gone,' those were the very words of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) landlady.
<p/>Perhaps at this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is in the restaurant with Ivan Fyodorovitch, for Ivan Fyodorovitch has not been home to dinner and Fyodor Pavlovitch dined alone an hour ago, and is gone to lie down.
<p/>But I beg you most particularly not to speak of me and of what I have told you, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>)'d kill me for nothing at all.''
<p/>It's as though there was an understanding between them. '' Brother Ivan invited Dmitri to the restaurant to-day? '' repeated Alyosha quickly.
<p/>'' That's so.'' <div class="bookquote">``The Metropolis tavern in the market-place? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The very same. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>'' That's quite likely,'' cried Alyosha, much excited.
<p/>'' Thank you, Smerdyakov; that's important. I'll go there at once. '' <div class="bookquote">``Don't betray me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>Smerdyakov called after him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). '' Oh, no, I'll go to the tavern as though by chance.
<p/>Don't be anxious.'' '' But wait a minute, I'll open the gate to you,'' cried Marya Kondratyevna. '' No; it's a short cut, I'll get over the fence again.
<p/>It was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) to go into the tavern in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) monastic dress, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) could inquire at the entrance for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brothers and call them down.
<p/>But just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) reached the tavern, a window was flung open, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother Ivan called down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) from it.
<p/>'' What he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had heard threw Alyosha into great agitation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) ran to the tavern. '' Alyosha, can't you come up here to me?
<p/>I shall be awfully grateful. '' '' To be sure I can, only I don't quite know whether in this dress--
<p/>'' '' But I am in a room apart. Come up the steps; I'll run down to meet you. '' A minute later Alyosha was sitting beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother.
<p/>Friends Ivan was not, however, in a separate room, but only in a place shut off by a screen, so that it was unseen by other people in the room.
<p/>Ivan was alone dining. Chapter III. The Brothers Make It was the first room from the entrance with a buffet along the wall.
<p/>Waiters were continually darting to and fro in it. The only customer in the room was an old retired military man drinking tea in a corner.
<p/>But there was the usual bustle going on in the other rooms of the tavern; there were shouts for the waiters, the sound of popping corks, the click of billiard balls, the drone of the organ.
<p/>Alyosha knew that Ivan did not usually visit this tavern and disliked taverns in general. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) must have come here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) reflected, simply to meet Dmitri by arrangement.
<p/>Yet Dmitri was not there. '' Shall I order you fish, soup or anything. You don't live on tea alone, I suppose,'' cried Ivan, apparently delighted at having got hold of Alyosha.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had finished dinner and was drinking tea. '' Let me have soup, and tea afterwards, I am hungry,'' said Alyosha gayly.
<p/>'' And cherry jam? They have it here. You remember how you used to love cherry jam when you were little?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You remember that? Let me have jam too, I like it still. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan rang for the waiter and ordered soup, jam and tea.
<p/>'' I remember everything, Alyosha, I remember you till you were eleven, I was nearly fifteen. There's such a difference between fifteen and eleven that brothers are never companions at those ages.
<p/>I don't know whether I was fond of you even. When I went away to Moscow for the first few years I never thought of you at all.
<p/>And now I've been here more than three months, and so far we have scarcely said a word to each other.
<p/>To-morrow I am going away, and I was just thinking as I sat here how I could see you to say good-by
<p/>Then, when you came to Moscow yourself, we only met once somewhere, I believe. and just then you passed. '' <div class="bookquote">``Were you very anxious to see me, then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Very. I want to get to know you once for all, and I want you to know me. And then to say good-by.
<p/>I believe it's always best to get to know people just before leaving them. I've noticed how you've been looking at me these three months.
<p/>There has been a continual look of expectation in your eyes, and I can't endure that. That's how it is I've kept away from you.
<p/>But in the end I have learned to respect you. The little man stands firm, I thought. Though I am laughing, I am serious.
<p/>You do stand firm, don't you? I like people who are firm like that whatever it is they stand by, even if they are such little fellows as you.
<p/>Your expectant eyes ceased to annoy me, I grew fond of them in the end, those expectant eyes. You seem to love me for some reason, Alyosha?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do love you, Ivan. Dmitri says of you-- Ivan is a tomb! I say of you, Ivan is a riddle.
<p/>You are a riddle to me even now. But I understand something in you, and I did not understand it till this morning.
<p/>That you are just as young as other young men of three and twenty, that you are just a young and fresh and nice boy, green in fact!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What's that?'' laughed Ivan. '' You won't be angry?'' Alyosha laughed too. '' Well?'' '' Now, have I insulted you dreadfully?''
<p/>Would you believe it that ever since that scene with her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), I have thought of nothing else but my youthful greenness, and just as though you guessed that, you begin about it.
<p/>Do you know I've been sitting here thinking to myself: that if I didn't believe in life, if I lost faith in the woman I love, lost faith in the order of things, were convinced in fact that everything is a disorderly, damnable, and perhaps devil-ridden chaos, if I were struck by every horror of man's disillusionment--still I should want to live and, having once tasted of the cup, I would not turn away from it till I had drained it!
<p/>At thirty, though, I shall be sure to leave the cup, even if I've not emptied it, and turn away--where I don't know.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, I am struck by a coincidence,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Ivan, warmly and good-humoredly. '' But till I am thirty, I know that my youth will triumph over everything--every disillusionment, every disgust with life.
<p/>I've asked myself many times whether there is in the world any despair that would overcome this frantic and perhaps unseemly thirst for life in me, and I've come to the conclusion that there isn't, that is till I am thirty, and then I shall lose it of myself,
<p/>It's a feature of the Karamazovs, it's true, that thirst for life regardless of everything; you have it no doubt too, but why is it base?
<p/>I fancy. Some driveling consumptive moralists--and poets especially--often call that thirst for life base. The centripetal force on our planet is still fearfully strong, Alyosha.
<p/>Though I may not believe in the order of the universe, yet I love the sticky little leaves as they open in spring.
<p/>I have a longing for life, and I go on living in spite of logic. I love the blue sky, I love some people, whom one loves you know sometimes without knowing why.
<p/>I love some great deeds done by men, though I've long ceased perhaps to have faith in them, yet from old habit one's heart prizes them.
<p/>Here they have brought the soup for you, eat it, it will do you good. It's first-rate soup, they know how to make it here.
<p/>I want to travel in Europe, Alyosha, I shall set off from here. And yet I know that I am only going to a graveyard, but it's a most precious graveyard
<p/>Precious are the dead that lie there, every stone over them speaks of such burning life in the past, of such passionate faith in their work, their truth, their struggle and their science, that I know I shall fall on the ground and kiss those stones and weep over them; though I'm convinced in my heart that it's long been nothing but a graveyard.
<p/>And I shall not weep from despair, but simply because I shall be happy in my tears, I shall steep my soul in my emotion.
<p/>, that's what it is! I love the sticky leaves in spring, the blue sky--that's all it is. It's not a matter of intellect or logic, it's loving with one's inside, with one's stomach.
<p/>One loves the first strength of one's youth. Do you understand anything of my tirade, Alyosha?'' Ivan laughed suddenly. '' I understand too well, Ivan.
<p/>One longs to love with one's inside, with one's stomach. You said that so well and I am awfully glad that you have such a longing for life,'' cried Alyosha.
<p/>'' I think every one should love life above everything in the world. '' <div class="bookquote">``Love life more than the meaning of it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, love it, regardless of logic as you say, it must be regardless of logic, and it's only then one will understand the meaning of it.
<p/>Half your work is done, Ivan, you love life, now you've only to try to do the second half and you are saved.
<p/>I have thought so a long time. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are trying to save me, but perhaps I am not lost! And what does your second half mean?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, one has to raise up your dead, who perhaps have not died after all. Come, let me have tea. I am so glad of our talk, Ivan.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I see you are feeling inspired. I am awfully fond of such professions de foi from such--novices. You are a steadfast person, Alexey.
<p/>Is it true that you mean to leave the monastery?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my elder sends me out into the world.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We shall see each other then in the world.
<p/>Father doesn't want to turn aside from his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) cup till he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is seventy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) dreams of hanging on to eighty in fact, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) says.
<p/>We shall meet before I am thirty, when I shall begin to turn aside from the cup. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) means it only too seriously, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is a buffoon.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) stands on a firm rock, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) stands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) sensuality--though after we are thirty, indeed, there may be nothing else to stand on....
<p/>But to hang on to seventy is nasty, better only to thirty; one might retain 'a shadow of nobility' by deceiving oneself.
<p/>Have you seen Dmitri to-day?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' No, but I saw Smerdyakov,'' and Alyosha rapidly, though minutely, described his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) meeting with Smerdyakov.
<p/>Ivan began listening anxiously and questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). '' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) begged me not to tell Dmitri that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had told me about him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>),'' added Alyosha.
<p/>Ivan frowned and pondered. '' Are you frowning on Smerdyakov's account?'' asked Alyosha. '' Yes, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) account. Damn him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), I certainly did want to see Dmitri, but now there's no need,'' said Ivan reluctantly.
<p/>'' But are you really going so soon, brother?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What of Dmitri and father? how will it end?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>asked Alyosha anxiously.
<p/>'' You are always harping upon it! What have I to do with it? Am I my brother Dmitri's keeper?'' Ivan snapped irritably, but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) suddenly smiled bitterly.
<p/>'' Cain's answer about his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) murdered brother, wasn't it? Perhaps that's what you're thinking at this moment? Well, damn it all, I can't stay here to be their keeper
<p/>Do you imagine I am jealous of Dmitri, that I've been trying to steal his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) beautiful Katerina Ivanovna for the last three months?
<p/>, can I? I've finished what I had to do, and I am going. Nonsense, I had business of my own.
<p/>I finished it. I am going. I finished it just now, you were witness. '' <div class="bookquote">``At Katerina Ivanovna's?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, and I've released myself once for all.
<p/>And after all, what have I to do with Dmitri? Dmitri doesn't come in. I had my own business to settle with Katerina Ivanovna.
<p/>You know, on the contrary, that Dmitri behaved as though there was an understanding between us. I didn't ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) to do it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) solemnly handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) over to me and gave us his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) blessing.
<p/>Would you believe, it, I sat here eating my dinner and was nearly ordering champagne to celebrate my first hour of freedom.
<p/>It's all too funny. Ah, Alyosha, if you only knew how light my heart is now! Tfoo! It's been going on nearly six months, and all at once I've thrown it off.
<p/>I could never have guessed even yesterday, how easy it would be to put an end to it if I wanted.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are speaking of your love, Ivan?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of my love, if you like. I fell in love with the young lady, I worried myself over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) worried me. I sat watching over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ... and all at once it's collapsed! I spoke this morning with inspiration, but I went away and roared with laughter.
<p/>Would you believe it? Yes, it's the literal truth. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You seem very merry about it now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>observed Alyosha, looking into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face, which had suddenly grown brighter.

<p/>And yet how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) attracted me! How attractive she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was just now when I made my speech! And do you know she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) attracts me awfully even now, yet how easy it is to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>Do you think I am boasting?'' '' No, only perhaps it wasn't love.'' <div class="bookquote">``Alyosha,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>laughed Ivan, <div class="bookquote">``don't make reflections about love, it's unseemly for you.
<p/>How you rushed into the discussion this morning! I've forgotten to kiss you for it.... But how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tormented me! It certainly was sitting by a `laceration.'
<p/>Ah, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knew how I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) loved me and not Dmitri,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan insisted gayly. '' Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) feeling for Dmitri was simply a self- laceration.
<p/>All I told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) just now was perfectly true, but the worst of it is, it may take her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fifteen or twenty years to find out that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) doesn't care for Dmitri, and loves me whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) torments, and perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may never find it out at all, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lesson to-day.
<p/>Well, it's better so ; I can simply go away for good. By the way, how is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) now? What happened after I departed?''
<p/>Alyosha told him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been hysterical, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) heard, unconscious and delirious. '' Isn't Madame Hohlakov laying it on?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think not. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I must find out. Nobody dies of hysterics, though. They don't matter. God gave woman hysterics as a relief.
<p/>I won't go to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at all. Why push myself forward again?''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>'' But you told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had never cared for you.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did that on purpose. Alyosha, shall I call for some champagne? Let us drink to my freedom. Ah, if only you knew how glad I am!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, brother, we had better not drink,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha suddenly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you settled to go to-morrow morning, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Morning? I didn't say I should go in the morning.... But perhaps it may be the morning.
<p/>Would you believe it, I dined here to-day only to avoid dining with the old man, I loathe him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so. I should have left long ago, so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is concerned.
<p/>But why are you so worried about my going away? We've plenty of time before I go, an eternity!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' If you are going away to-morrow, what do you mean by an eternity?''
<p/>'' But what does it matter to us? '' laughed Ivan. '' We've time enough for our talk, for what brought us here.
<p/>To talk of my love for Katerina Ivanovna, of the old man and Dmitri? of foreign travel? of the fatal position of Russia?
<p/>Why do you look so surprised? Answer: why have we met here? Of the Emperor Napoleon? Is that it?'' <div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Then you know what for. It's different for other people; but we in our green youth have to settle the eternal questions first of all.
<p/>That's what we care about. Young Russia is talking about nothing but the eternal questions now. Just when the old folks are all taken up with practical questions.
<p/>Why have you been looking at me in expectation for the last three months? To ask me, `What do you believe, or don't you believe at all?'
<p/>That's what your eyes have been meaning for these three months, haven't they?'' <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>smiled Alyosha. '' You are not laughing at me, now, Ivan?''
<p/>'' Me laughing! I don't want to wound my little brother who has been watching me with such expectation for three months.
<p/>Alyosha, look straight at me! Of course I am just such a little boy as you are, only not a novice.
<p/>And what have Russian boys been doing up till now, some of them, I mean? In this stinking tavern, for instance, here, they meet and sit down in a corner.
<p/>They've never met in their lives before and, when they go out of the tavern, they won't meet again for forty years.
<p/>And what do they talk about in that momentary halt in the tavern? Of the eternal questions, of the existence of God and immortality.
<p/>And those who do not believe in God talk of socialism or anarchism, of the transformation of all humanity on a new pattern, so that it all comes to the same
<p/>, they're the same questions turned inside out. And masses, masses of the most original Russian boys do nothing but talk of the eternal questions!
<p/>Yes, for real Russians the questions of God's existence and of immortality, or, as you say, the same questions turned inside out, come first and foremost, of course, and so they should,'' said Alyosha, still watching his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) brother with the same gentle and inquiring smile.
<p/>Well, Alyosha, it's sometimes very unwise to be a Russian at all, but anything stupider than the way Russian boys spend their time one can hardly imagine.
<p/>Isn't it so?'' '' '' But there's one Russian boy called Alyosha I am awfully fond of. '' <div class="bookquote">``How nicely you put that in!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/>Alyosha laughed suddenly. '' Well, tell me where to begin, give your orders. The existence of God, eh?'' <div class="bookquote">``Begin where you like.
<p/>You declared yesterday at father's that there was no God.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha looked searchingly at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) brother. '' I said that yesterday at dinner on purpose to tease you
<p/>and I saw your eyes glow. But now I've no objection to discussing with you, and I say so very seriously.
<p/>I want to be friends with you, Alyosha, for I have no friends and want to try it. Well, only fancy, perhaps I too accept God,'' laughed Ivan; <div class="bookquote">``that's a surprise for you, isn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, of course, if you are not joking now.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Joking? I was told at the elder's yesterday that I was joking.
<p/>You know, dear boy, there was an old sinner in the eighteenth century who declared that, if there were no God, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would have to be invented.
<p/>And what's strange, what would be marvelous, is not that God should really exist; the marvel is that such an idea, the idea of the necessity of God, could enter the head of such a savage, vicious beast as man.
<p/>S'il n'existait pas Dieu, il faudrait l'inventer. And man has actually invented God. So holy it is, so touching, so wise and so great a credit it does to man.
<p/>And I won't go through all the axioms laid down by Russian boys on that subject, all derived from European hypotheses; for what's a hypothesis there, is an axiom with the Russian boy, and not only with the boys but with their teachers too, for our Russian professors are often just the same boys themselves.
<p/>As for me, I've long resolved not to think whether man created God or God man. And so I omit all the hypotheses.
<p/>I am trying to explain as quickly as possible my essential nature, that is what manner of man I am, what I believe in, and for what I hope, that's it, isn't it?
<p/>But you must note this: if God exists and if He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) really did create the world, then, as we all know, He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) created it according to the geometry of Euclid and the human mind with the conception of only three dimensions in space.
<p/>Yet there have been and still are geometricians and philosophers, and even some of the most distinguished, who doubt whether the whole universe, or to speak more widely the whole of being, was only created in Euclid's geometry; they even dare to dream that two parallel lines, which according to Euclid can never meet on earth, may meet somewhere in infinity.
<p/>For what are we aiming at now? And therefore I tell you that I accept God simply. I have come to the conclusion that, since I can't understand even that, I can't expect to understand about God.
<p/>I acknowledge humbly that I have no faculty for settling such questions, I have a Euclidian earthly mind, and how could I solve problems that are not of this world?
<p/>And I advise you never to think about it either, my dear Alyosha, especially about God, whether He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) exists or not.
<p/>And so I accept God and am glad to, and what's more, I accept His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wisdom, His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) purpose--which are utterly beyond our ken; I believe in the underlying order and the meaning of life; I believe in the eternal harmony in which they say we shall one day be blended.
<p/>I believe in the Word to Which the universe is striving, and Which Itself was `with God,' and Which Itself is God and so on, and so on, to infinity.
<p/>All such questions are utterly inappropriate for a mind created with an idea of only three dimensions. There are all sorts of phrases for it.
<p/>Yet would you believe it, in the final result I don't accept this world of God's, and, although I know it exists, I don't accept it at all.
<p/>I seem to be on the right path, don't I? It's not that I don't accept God, you must understand, it's the world created by Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
<p/>I believe like a child that suffering will be healed and made up for, that all the humiliating absurdity of human contradictions will vanish like a pitiful mirage, like the despicable fabrication of the impotent and infinitely small Euclidian mind of man, that in the world's finale, at the moment of eternal harmony, something so precious will come to pass that it will suffice for all hearts, for the comforting of all resentments, for the atonement of all the crimes of humanity, of all the blood they've shed; that it will make it not only possible to forgive but to justify all that has happened with men--but though all that may come to pass, I don't accept it.
<p/>I don't and cannot accept. Let me make it plain. I won't accept it. Even if parallel lines do meet and I see it myself
<p/>, I shall see it and say that they've met, but still I won't accept it. That's what's at the root of me, Alyosha; that's my creed.
<p/>I began our talk as stupidly as I could on purpose, but I've led up to my confession, for that's all you want.
<p/>I am in earnest in what I say. You didn't want to hear about God, but only to know what the brother you love lives by.
<p/>And so I've told you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan concluded his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) long tirade with marked and unexpected feeling. '' And why did you begin `as stupidly as you could'?
<p/>'' asked Alyosha, looking dreamily at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). '' To begin with, for the sake of being Russian. Russian conversations on such subjects are always carried on inconceivably stupidly.
<p/>And secondly, the stupider one is, the closer one is to reality. The stupider one is, the clearer one is. Stupidity is brief and artless, while intelligence wriggles and hides itself.
<p/>Intelligence is a knave, but stupidity is honest and straightforward. I've led the conversation to my despair, and the more stupidly I have presented it, the better for me.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will explain why you don't accept the world?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha. '' To be sure I will, it's not a secret, that's what I've been leading up to.
<p/>Dear little brother, I don't want to corrupt you or to turn you from your stronghold, perhaps I want to be healed by you.
<p/>'' Ivan smiled suddenly quite like a little gentle child. Alyosha had never seen such a smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face before.
<p/>Chapter IV. Rebellion <div class="bookquote">``I must make you one confession,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan began. '' I could never understand how one can love one's neighbors.
<p/>I once read somewhere of John the Merciful, a saint, that when a hungry, frozen beggar came to him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) bed, held him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) arms, and began breathing into his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) mouth, which was putrid and loathsome from some awful disease.
<p/>I am convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) did that from `self-laceration,' from the self-laceration of falsity, for the sake of the charity imposed by duty, as a penance laid on him (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>).
<p/>For any one to love a man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be hidden, for as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shows his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, love is gone.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Father Zossima has talked of that more than once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>observed Alyosha; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>), too, said that the face of a man often hinders many people not practiced in love, from loving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>It's just one's neighbors, to my mind, that one can't love, though one might love those at a distance. But yet there's a great deal of love in mankind, and almost Christ-like love.
<p/>Well, I know nothing of it so far, and can't understand it, and the innumerable mass of mankind are with me there.
<p/>I know that myself, Ivan.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>'' The question is, whether that's due to men's bad qualities or whether it's inherent in their nature.
<p/>To my thinking, Christ-like love for men is a miracle impossible on earth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was God. But we are not gods.
<p/>Suppose I, for instance, suffer intensely. Another can never know how much I suffer, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is another and not I.
<p/>And what's more, a man is rarely ready to admit another's suffering -LRB-as though it were a distinction-RRB-. Why won't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) admit it, do you think?
<p/>Besides, there is suffering and suffering; degrading, humiliating suffering such as humbles me--hunger, for instance--my benefactor will perhaps allow me; but when you come to higher suffering--for an idea, for instance--he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) will very rarely admit that, perhaps because my face strikes him (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) as not at all what he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) fancies a man should have who suffers for an idea.
<p/>Because I smell unpleasant, because I have a stupid face, because I once trod on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) foot. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deprives me instantly of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) favor, and not at all from badness of heart.
<p/>Beggars, especially genteel beggars, ought never to show themselves, but to ask for charity through the newspapers. One can love one's neighbors in the abstract, or even at a distance, but at close quarters it's almost impossible.
<p/>If it were as on the stage, in the ballet, where if beggars come in, they wear silken rags and tattered lace and beg for alms dancing gracefully, then one might like looking at them.
<p/>But even then we should not love them. But enough of that. I simply wanted to show you my point of view.
<p/>I meant to speak of the suffering of mankind generally, but we had better confine ourselves to the sufferings of the children.
<p/>That reduces the scope of my argument to a tenth of what it would be. Still we'd better keep to the children, though it does weaken my case.
<p/>But, in the first place, children can be loved even at close quarters, even when they are dirty, even when they are ugly -LRB-I fancy, though, children never are ugly-RRB-.
<p/>The second reason why I won't speak of grown-up people is that, besides being disgusting and unworthy of love, they have a compensation--
<p/>they've eaten the apple and know good and evil, and they have become `like gods.' They go on eating it still.
<p/>But the children haven't eaten anything, and are so far innocent. Are you fond of children, Alyosha? I know you are, and you will understand why I prefer to speak of them.
<p/>If they, too, suffer horribly on earth, they must suffer for their fathers' sins, they must be punished for their fathers, who have eaten the apple; but that reasoning is of the other world and is incomprehensible for the heart of man here on earth.
<p/>The innocent must not suffer for another's sins, and especially such innocents! You may be surprised at me, Alyosha, but I am awfully fond of children, too.
<p/>Children while they are quite little--up to seven, for instance--are so remote from grown-up people; they are different creatures, as it were, of a different species.
<p/>I knew a criminal in prison who had, in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) career as a burglar, murdered whole families, including several children.
<p/>And observe, cruel people, the violent, the rapacious, the Karamazovs are sometimes very fond of children. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in prison, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a strange affection for them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spent all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) time at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) window, watching the children playing in the prison yard. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trained one little boy to come up to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) window and made great friends with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)....
<p/>You don't know why I am telling you all this, Alyosha? My head aches and I am sad. '' <div class="bookquote">``You speak with a strange air,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>observed Alyosha uneasily, <div class="bookquote">``as though you were not quite yourself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``By the way, a Bulgarian I met lately in Moscow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan went on, seeming not to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother's words, <div class="bookquote">``told me about the crimes committed by Turks and Circassians in all parts of Bulgaria through fear of a general rising of the Slavs.
<p/>They burn villages, murder, outrage women and children, they nail their prisoners by the ears to the fences, leave them so till morning, and in the morning they hang them--all sorts of things you can't imagine.
<p/>People talk sometimes of bestial cruelty, but that's a great injustice and insult to the beasts; a beast can never be so cruel as a man, so artistically cruel.
<p/>The tiger only tears and gnaws, that's all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can do. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would never think of nailing people by the ears, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were able to do it.
<p/>These Turks took a pleasure in torturing children, too; cutting the unborn child from the mother's womb, and tossing babies up in the air and catching them on the points of their bayonets before their mothers' eyes.
<p/>Doing it before the mothers' eyes was what gave zest to the amusement. Here is another scene that I thought very interesting.
<p/>Imagine a trembling mother with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) baby in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms, a circle of invading Turks around her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). They've planned a diversion: they pet the baby, laugh to make it laugh.
<p/>The baby laughs with glee, holds out its little hands to the pistol, and he (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pulls the trigger in the baby's face and blows out its brains.
<p/>They succeed, the baby laughs. At that moment a Turk points a pistol four inches from the baby's face. Artistic, wasn't it?
<p/>By the way, Turks are particularly fond of sweet things, they say. ''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>'' Brother, what are you driving at?'' asked Alyosha.
<p/>I think if the devil doesn't exist, but man has created him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has created him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own image and likeness.''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did God, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>observed Alyosha. '' `It's wonderful how you can turn words,' as Polonius says in Hamlet ,'' laughed Ivan.
<p/>'' You turn my words against me. Well, I am glad. Yours must be a fine God, if man created Him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) image and likeness.
<p/>You see, I am fond of collecting certain facts, and, would you believe, I even copy anecdotes of a certain sort from newspapers and books, and I've already got a fine collection.
<p/>You asked just now what I was driving at. The Turks, of course, have gone into it, but they are foreigners.
<p/>I have specimens from home that are even better than the Turks. You know we prefer beating--rods and scourges--that's our national institution.
<p/>Nailing ears is unthinkable for us, for we are, after all, Europeans. But the rod and the scourge we have always with us and they cannot be taken from us.
<p/>Abroad now they scarcely do any beating. Manners are more humane, or laws have been passed, so that they don't dare to flog men now.
<p/>And so national that it would be practically impossible among us, though I believe we are being inoculated with it, since the religious movement began in our aristocracy.
<p/>I have a charming pamphlet, translated from the French, describing how, quite recently, five years ago, a murderer, Richard, was executed--a young man, I believe, of three and twenty, who repented and was converted to the Christian faith at the very scaffold.
<p/>This Richard was an illegitimate child who was given as a child of six by his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) parents to some shepherds on the Swiss mountains.
<p/>But they make up for it in another way just as national as ours. They brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) up to work for them.
<p/>The shepherds taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) nothing, and scarcely fed or clothed him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>), but sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) out at seven to herd the flock in cold and wet, and no one hesitated or scrupled to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) so.
<p/>Quite the contrary, they thought they had every right, for Richard had been given to them as a chattel, and they did not even see the necessity of feeding him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>).
<p/>Richard himself describes how in those years, like the Prodigal Son in the Gospel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) longed to eat of the mash given to the pigs, which were fattened for sale.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) grew up like a little wild beast among them. But they wouldn't even give him (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) that, and beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) stole from the pigs.
<p/>And that was how he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) spent all his (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) childhood and his (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) youth, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) grew up and was strong enough to go away and be a thief.
<p/>The savage began to earn his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) living as a day laborer in Geneva. He (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) drank what he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) earned, he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) lived like a brute, and finished by killing and robbing an old man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was caught, tried, and condemned to death. They are not sentimentalists there. And in prison he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was immediately surrounded by pastors, members of Christian brotherhoods, philanthropic ladies, and the like.
<p/>They taught him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to read and write in prison, and expounded the Gospel to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). They exhorted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), worked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), drummed at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) incessantly, till at last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) solemnly confessed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crime.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote to the court himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a monster, but that in the end God had vouchsafed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) light and shown grace.
<p/>All the aristocratic and well-bred society of the town rushed to the prison, kissed Richard and embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>); `You are our brother, you have found grace.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was converted. All Geneva was in excitement about him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>)--all philanthropic and religious Geneva. And Richard does nothing but weep with emotion, `Yes, I've found grace!
<p/>All my youth and childhood I was glad of pigs' food, but now even I have found grace. I am dying in the Lord.' '
<p/>Though it's not your fault that you knew not the Lord, when you coveted the pigs' food and were beaten for stealing it -LRB-which was very wrong of you, for stealing is forbidden-RRB-; but you've shed blood and you must die.'
<p/>And on the last day, Richard, perfectly limp, did nothing but cry and repeat every minute: `This is my happiest day.
<p/>Yes, Richard, die in the Lord; you have shed blood and must die. I am going to the Lord.' ' Yes,' cry the pastors and the judges and philanthropic ladies. '
<p/>This is the happiest day of your life, for you are going to the Lord!' They all walk or drive to the scaffold in procession behind the prison van.
<p/>At the scaffold they call to Richard: `Die, brother, die in the Lord, for even thou hast found grace!' And so, covered with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) brothers' kisses, Richard is dragged on to the scaffold, and led to the guillotine.
<p/>That pamphlet is translated into Russian by some Russian philanthropists of aristocratic rank and evangelical aspirations, and has been distributed gratis for the enlightenment of the people.
<p/>And they chopped off his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) head in brotherly fashion, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had found grace. Yes, that's characteristic. The case of Richard is interesting because it's national.
<p/>Though to us it's absurd to cut off a man's head, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has become our brother and has found grace, yet we have our own speciality, which is all but worse.
<p/>There are lines in Nekrassov describing how a peasant lashes a horse on the eyes, `on its meek eyes,' every one must have seen it.
<p/>Our historical pastime is the direct satisfaction of inflicting pain. It's peculiarly Russian. He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) describes how a feeble little nag has foundered under too heavy a load and cannot move.
<p/>The peasant beats it, beats it savagely, beats it at last not knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) is doing in the intoxication of cruelty, thrashes it mercilessly over and over again. '
<p/>However weak you are, you must pull, if you die for it.' The nag strains, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) begins lashing the poor defenseless creature on its weeping, on its `meek eyes.'
<p/>The frantic beast tugs and draws the load, trembling all over, gasping for breath, moving sideways, with a sort of unnatural spasmodic action--it's awful in Nekrassov.
<p/>But that's only a horse, and God has given horses to be beaten. So the Tatars have taught us, and they left us the knout as a remembrance of it.
<p/>But men, too, can be beaten. A well-educated, cultured gentleman and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wife beat their own child with a birch-rod, a girl of seven.
<p/>I have an exact account of it. The papa was glad that the birch was covered with twigs. ' It stings more,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>), and so he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) began stinging his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) daughter.
<p/>I know for a fact there are people who at every blow are worked up to sensuality, to literal sensuality, which increases progressively at every blow they inflict.
<p/>They beat for a minute, for five minutes, for ten minutes, more often and more savagely. The child screams. At last the child cannot scream, it gasps, `Daddy!
<p/>daddy!' By some diabolical unseemly chance the case was brought into court. A counsel is engaged. The Russian people have long called a barrister 'a conscience for hire.'
<p/>The counsel protests in his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) client's defense. ' It's such a simple thing,' he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) says, `an everyday domestic event. A father corrects his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) child.
<p/>To our shame be it said, it is brought into court.' The jury, convinced by him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), give a favorable verdict. The public roars with delight that the torturer is acquitted.
<p/>Ah, pity I wasn't there! I would have proposed to raise a subscription in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) honor! Charming pictures. '' But I've still better things about children.
<p/>There was a little girl of five who was hated by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father and mother, `most worthy and respectable people, of good education and breeding.'
<p/>You see, I must repeat again, it is a peculiar characteristic of many people, this love of torturing children, and children only.
<p/>To all other types of humanity these torturers behave mildly and benevolently, like cultivated and humane Europeans; but they are very fond of tormenting children, even fond of children themselves in that sense.
<p/>It's just their defenselessness that tempts the tormentor, just the angelic confidence of the child who has no refuge and no appeal, that sets his (<font color='blue'><b>tormentor</b></font>) vile blood on fire.
<p/>In every man, of course, a demon lies hidden--the demon of rage, the demon of lustful heat at the screams of the tortured victim, the demon of lawlessness let off the chain, the demon of diseases that follow on vice, gout, kidney disease, and so on.
<p/>I've collected a great, great deal about Russian children, Alyosha. '' This poor child of five was subjected to every possible torture by those cultivated parents.
<p/>Then, they went to greater refinements of cruelty--shut her (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) up all night in the cold and frost in a privy, and because she (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) didn't ask to be taken up at night -LRB-as though a child of five sleeping its angelic, sound sleep could be trained to wake and ask-RRB-, they smeared her (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) face and filled her (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) mouth with excrement, and it was her (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) mother,
<p/>They beat her (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>), thrashed her (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>), kicked her (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) for no reason till her (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) body was one bruise. her (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) mother did this. And that mother could sleep, hearing the poor child's groans!
<p/>Can you understand why a little creature, who can't even understand what's done to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), should beat her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) little aching heart with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tiny fist in the dark and the cold, and weep her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) meek unresentful tears to dear, kind God to protect her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?
<p/>Do you understand that, friend and brother, you pious and humble novice? Do you understand why this infamy must be and is permitted?
<p/>Without it, I am told, man could not have existed on earth, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not have known good and evil.
<p/>Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) know that diabolical good and evil when it costs so much? Why, the whole world of knowledge is not worth that child's prayer to `dear, kind God'!
<p/>I say nothing of the sufferings of grown-up people, they have eaten the apple, damn them, and the devil take them all!
<p/>But these little ones! I am making you suffer, Alyosha, you are not yourself. I'll leave off if you like.'' <div class="bookquote">``Never mind.
<p/>One picture, only one more, because it's so curious, so characteristic, and I have only just read it in some collection of Russian antiquities.
<p/>It was in the darkest days of serfdom at the beginning of the century, and long live the Liberator of the People!
<p/>There was in those days a general of aristocratic connections, the owner of great estates, one of those men--somewhat exceptional, I believe, even then--who, retiring from the service into a life of leisure, are convinced that they've earned absolute power over the lives of their subjects.
<p/>I want to suffer too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>muttered Alyosha. '' I've forgotten the name. I must look it up. There were such men then.
<p/>So our general, settled on his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) property of two thousand souls, lives in pomp, and domineers over his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) poor neighbors as though they were dependents and buffoons.
<p/>One day a serf-boy, a little child of eight, threw a stone in play and hurt the paw of the general's favorite hound. '
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) has kennels of hundreds of hounds and nearly a hundred dog-boys-- all mounted, and in uniform. Why is my favorite dog lame?'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) is told that the boy threw a stone that hurt the dog's paw. ' So you did it.' The general looked the child up and down. '
<p/>Early that morning the general comes out on horseback, with the hounds, his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) dependents, dog-boys, and huntsmen, all mounted around him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) in full hunting parade.
<p/>Take him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>).' He (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) was taken--taken from his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) mother and kept shut up all night. The servants are summoned for their edification, and in front of them all stands the mother of the child.
<p/>The child is brought from the lock-up. It's a gloomy, cold, foggy autumn day, a capital day for hunting. The general orders the child to be undressed; the child is stripped naked.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) shivers, numb with terror, not daring to cry... `Make him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) run,' commands the general. ' Run! run!' shout the dog-boys.
<p/>The boy runs... ' At him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)!' yells the general, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sets the whole pack of hounds on the child. The hounds catch him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and tear him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to pieces before his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother's eyes!...
<p/>I believe the general was afterwards declared incapable of administering his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) estates. Well--what did he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) deserve? To be shot? To be shot for the satisfaction of our moral feelings?
<p/>Speak, Alyosha!'' <div class="bookquote">``To be shot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>murmured Alyosha, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) eyes to Ivan with a pale, twisted smile. <div class="bookquote">``Bravo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Ivan, delighted.
<p/>'' If even you say so.... You're a pretty monk! So there is a little devil sitting in your heart, Alyosha Karamazov!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What I said was absurd, but-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>'' That's just the point, that `but'!'' cried Ivan. <div class="bookquote">``Let me tell you, novice, that the absurd is only too necessary on earth.
<p/>The world stands on absurdities, and perhaps nothing would have come to pass in it without them. We know what we know!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What do you know?'' <div class="bookquote">``I understand nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan went on, as though in delirium. '' I don't want to understand anything now.
<p/>If I try to understand anything, I shall be false to the fact, and I have determined to stick to the fact.
<p/>I want to stick to the fact. I made up my mind long ago not to understand. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why are you trying me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/>Alyosha cried, with sudden distress. '' Will you say what you mean at last?'' <div class="bookquote">``Of course, I will; that's what I've been leading up to.
<p/>You are dear to me, I don't want to let you go, and I won't give you up to your Zossima.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan for a minute was silent, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face became all at once very sad. <div class="bookquote">``Listen! I took the case of children only to make my case clearer.
<p/>Of the other tears of humanity with which the earth is soaked from its crust to its center, I will say nothing.
<p/>I am a bug, and I recognize in all humility that I cannot understand why the world is arranged as it is.
<p/>Men are themselves to blame, I suppose; they were given paradise, they wanted freedom, and stole fire from heaven, though they knew they would become unhappy, so there is no need to pity them.
<p/>With my pitiful, earthly, Euclidian understanding, all I know is that there is suffering and that there are none guilty; that cause follows effect, simply and directly; that everything flows and finds its level--but that's only Euclidian nonsense, I know that, and I can't consent to live by it!
<p/>What comfort is it to me that there are none guilty and that cause follows effect simply and directly, and that I know it?--I must have justice, or I will destroy myself.
<p/>I have narrowed my subject on purpose. And not justice in some remote infinite time and space, but here on earth, and that I could see myself.
<p/>I want to see it, and if I am dead by then, let me rise again, for if it all happens without me, it will be too unfair.
<p/>Surely I haven't suffered, simply that I, my crimes and my sufferings, may manure the soil of the future harmony for somebody else.
<p/>I want to see with my own eyes the hind lie down with the lion and the victim rise up and embrace his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) murderer.
<p/>I have believed in it. I want to be there when every one suddenly understands what it has all been for.
<p/>All the religions of the world are built on this longing, and I am a believer. But then there are the children, and what am I to do about them?
<p/>For the hundredth time I repeat, there are numbers of questions, but I've only taken the children, because in their case what I mean is so unanswerably clear.
<p/>That's a question I can't answer. Listen! If all must suffer to pay for the eternal harmony, what have children to do with it, tell me, please?
<p/>It's beyond all comprehension why they should suffer, and why they should pay for the harmony. Why should they, too, furnish material to enrich the soil for the harmony of the future?
<p/>I understand solidarity in sin among men. I understand solidarity in retribution, too; but there can be no such solidarity with children.
<p/>And if it is really true that they must share responsibility for all their fathers' crimes, such a truth is not of this world and is beyond my comprehension.
<p/>Some jester will say, perhaps, that the child would have grown up and have sinned, but you see he (<font color='blue'><b>jester</b></font>) didn't grow up, he (<font color='blue'><b>jester</b></font>) was torn to pieces by the dogs, at eight years old.
<p/>I understand, of course, what an upheaval of the universe it will be, when everything in heaven and earth blends in one hymn of praise and everything that lives and has lived cries aloud: `Thou art just, O Lord, for Thy ways are revealed.'
<p/>When the mother embraces the fiend who threw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child to the dogs, and all three cry aloud with tears, `Thou art just, O Lord!'
<p/>Oh, Alyosha, I am not blaspheming! then, of course, the crown of knowledge will be reached and all will be made clear.
<p/>But what pulls me up here is that I can't accept that harmony. And while I am on earth, I make haste to take my own measures.
<p/>You see, Alyosha, perhaps it really may happen that if I live to that moment, or rise again to see it, I, too, perhaps, may cry aloud with the rest, looking at the mother embracing the child's torturer, `Thou art just, O Lord!'
<p/>but I don't want to cry aloud then. While there is still time, I hasten to protect myself, and so I renounce the higher harmony altogether.
<p/>It's not worth the tears of that one tortured child who beat itself on the breast with its little fist and prayed in its stinking outhouse, with its unexpiated tears to `dear, kind God'!
<p/>It's not worth it, because those tears are unatoned for. They must be atoned for, or there can be no harmony.
<p/>But how? How are you going to atone for them? Is it possible? By their being avenged? But what do I care for avenging them?
<p/>What do I care for a hell for oppressors? What good can hell do, since those children have already been tortured?
<p/>And what becomes of harmony, if there is hell? I want to forgive. I want to embrace. I don't want more suffering.
<p/>And if the sufferings of children go to swell the sum of sufferings which was necessary to pay for truth, then I protest that the truth is not worth such a price.
<p/>I don't want the mother to embrace the oppressor who threw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son to the dogs! She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dare not forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)!
<p/>Let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) for herself, if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will, let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) forgive the torturer for the immeasurable suffering of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's heart.
<p/>But the sufferings of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tortured child she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has no right to forgive; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dare not forgive the torturer, even if the child were to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)!
<p/>And if that is so, if they dare not forgive, what becomes of harmony? Is there in the whole world a being who would have the right to forgive and could forgive?
<p/>I don't want harmony. From love for humanity I don't want it. I would rather be left with the unavenged suffering.
<p/>Besides, too high a price is asked for harmony; it's beyond our means to pay so much to enter on it.
<p/>And so I hasten to give back my entrance ticket, and if I am an honest man I am bound to give it back as soon as possible.
<p/>I would rather remain with my unavenged suffering and unsatisfied indignation, even if I were wrong . And that I am doing.
<p/>It's not God that I don't accept, Alyosha, only I most respectfully return Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) the ticket.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>'' That's rebellion,'' murmured Alyosha, looking down.
<p/>'' Rebellion? I am sorry you call it that,'' said Ivan earnestly. '' One can hardly live in rebellion, and I want to live.
<p/>Imagine that you are creating a fabric of human destiny with the object of making men happy in the end, giving them peace and rest at last, but that it was essential and inevitable to torture to death only one tiny creature--that baby beating its breast with its fist, for instance--and to found that edifice on its unavenged tears, would you consent to be the architect on those conditions?
<p/>Tell me yourself, I challenge you--answer. Tell me, and tell the truth.'' '' No, I wouldn't consent,'' said Alyosha softly. ''
<p/>And can you admit the idea that men for whom you are building it would agree to accept their happiness on the foundation of the unexpiated blood of a little victim?
<p/>Brother,'' said Alyosha suddenly, with flashing eyes, <div class="bookquote">``you said just now, is there a being in the whole world who would have the right to forgive and could forgive?
<p/>And accepting it would remain happy for ever?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>'' No, I can't admit it. But there is a Being and He (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) can forgive everything, all and for all, because He (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) gave His (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) innocent blood for all and everything.
<p/>You have forgotten Him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>), and on Him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) is built the edifice, and it is to Him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) they cry aloud, `Thou art just, O Lord, for Thy ways are revealed!'
<p/>No, I have not forgotten Him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>); on the contrary I've been wondering all the time how it was you did not bring Him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) in before, for usually all arguments on your side put Him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) in the foreground.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! the One without sin and His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) blood! Do you know, Alyosha--don't laugh! I made a poem about a year ago.
<p/>If you can waste another ten minutes on me, I'll tell it to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You wrote a poem?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, no, I didn't write it,'' laughed Ivan, <div class="bookquote">``and I've never written two lines of poetry in my life.
<p/>But I made up this poem in prose and I remembered it. I was carried away when I made it up.
<p/>You will be my first reader--that is listener. Why should an author forego even one listener? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>smiled Ivan. '' Shall I tell it to you?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am all attention,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha. '' My poem is called `The Grand Inquisitor'; it's a ridiculous thing, but I want to tell it to you.
<p/>The Grand Inquisitor <div class="bookquote">``Even this must have a preface--that is, a literary preface,''  (<font color='red'><b>The Grand Inquisitor</b></font>)</div>laughed Ivan, <div class="bookquote">``and I am a poor hand at making one.
<p/>You see, my action takes place in the sixteenth century, and at that time, as you probably learnt at school, it was customary in poetry to bring down heavenly powers on earth.
<p/>Not to speak of Dante, in France, clerks, as well as the monks in the monasteries, used to give regular performances in which the Madonna, the saints, the angels, Christ, and God himself were brought on the stage.
<p/>In Victor Hugo's Notre Dame de Paris an edifying and gratuitous spectacle was provided for the people in the Hôtel de Ville of Paris in the reign of Louis XI.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Chapter V. In those days it was done in all simplicity. in honor of the birth of the dauphin. It was called Le bon jugement
<p/>de la trčs sainte et gracieuse Vierge Marie , and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) appears herself on the stage and pronounces her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) bon jugement .
<p/>Similar plays, chiefly from the Old Testament, were occasionally performed in Moscow too, up to the times of Peter the Great.
<p/>But besides plays there were all sorts of legends and ballads scattered about the world, in which the saints and angels and all the powers of Heaven took part when required.
<p/>There is, for instance, one such poem -LRB-of course, from the Greek-RRB-, The Wanderings of Our Lady through Hell , with descriptions as bold as Dante's.
<p/>In our monasteries the monks busied themselves in translating, copying, and even composing such poems--and even under the Tatars. Our Lady visits hell, and the Archangel Michael leads her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) through the torments.
<p/>There she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) sees among others one noteworthy set of sinners in a burning lake; some of them sink to the bottom of the lake so that they can't swim out, and `these God forgets'--an expression of extraordinary depth and force.
<p/>And so Our Lady, shocked and weeping, falls before the throne of God and begs for mercy for all in hell--for all she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) has seen there, indiscriminately.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) beseeches Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) will not desist, and when God points to the hands and feet of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) Son, nailed to the Cross, and asks, `How can I forgive His (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>) tormentors?'
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) bids all the saints, all the martyrs, all the angels and archangels to fall down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) and pray for mercy on all without distinction.
<p/>It ends by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) winning from God a respite of suffering every year from Good Friday till Trinity Day, and the sinners at once raise a cry of thankfulness from hell, chanting, '
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) sees the sinners and their punishment. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) conversation with God is immensely interesting. Thou art just, O Lord, in this judgment.'
<p/>Well, my poem would have been of that kind if it had appeared at that time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) comes on the scene in my poem, but He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) says nothing, only appears and passes on.
<p/>fifteen centuries since His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) prophet wrote, `Behold, I come quickly'; `Of that day and that hour knoweth no man, neither the Son, but the Father,' as He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) Himself predicted on earth.
<p/>Fifteen centuries have passed since He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) promised to come in His (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) glory, But humanity awaits him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) with the same faith and with the same love.
<p/>Oh, with greater faith, for it is fifteen centuries since man has ceased to see signs from heaven. No signs from heaven come to-day
<p/>To add to what the heart doth say. There was nothing left but faith in what the heart doth say. It is true there were many miracles in those days.
<p/>There were saints who performed miraculous cures; some holy people, according to their biographies, were visited by the Queen of Heaven herself.
<p/>But the devil did not slumber, and doubts were already arising among men of the truth of these miracles. And just then there appeared in the north of Germany a terrible new heresy.
<p/>A huge star like to a torch'' -LRB-that is, to a church-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``fell on the sources of the waters and they became bitter.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>These heretics</b></font>)</div>'' These heretics began blasphemously denying miracles. But those who remained faithful were all the more ardent in their faith.
<p/>The tears of humanity rose up to Him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) as before, awaited His (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) coming, loved Him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), hoped for Him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), yearned to suffer and die for Him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) as before.
<p/>Thy coming,'' so many ages called upon Him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), that in His (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) infinite mercy He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) deigned to come down to His (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) servants.
<p/>Before that day He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had come down, He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had visited some holy men, martyrs and hermits, as is written in their lives.
<p/>Among us, Tyutchev, with absolute faith in the truth of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) words, bore witness that Bearing the Cross, in slavish dress, Weary and worn, the Heavenly King Our mother, Russia, came to bless, And through our land went wandering.
<p/>And so many ages mankind had prayed with faith and fervor, <div class="bookquote">``O Lord our God, hasten And that certainly was so, I assure you.
<p/>And behold, He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) deigned to appear for a moment to the people, to the tortured, suffering people, sunk in iniquity, but loving Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) like children.
<p/>My story is laid in Spain, in Seville, in the most terrible time of the Inquisition, when fires were lighted every day to the glory of God, and `in the splendid auto da fé the wicked heretics were burnt.'
<p/>Oh, of course, this was not the coming in which He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will appear according to His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) promise at the end of time in all His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heavenly glory, and which will be sudden `as lightning flashing from east to west.'
<p/>In His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) infinite mercy He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) came once more among men in that human shape in which He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) walked among men for three years fifteen centuries ago.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) came down to the `hot pavements' of the southern town in which on the day before almost a hundred heretics had, ad majorem gloriam Dei , been burnt by the cardinal, the Grand Inquisitor, in a magnificent auto da fé , in the presence of the king, the court, the knights, the cardinals, the most charming ladies of the court, and the whole population of Seville.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>ages</b></font>)</div>No, He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) visited His (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) children only for a moment, and there where the flames were crackling round the heretics. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) came softly, unobserved, and yet, strange to say, every one recognized Him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>). That might be one of the best passages in the poem.
<p/>I mean, why they recognized Him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>). The people are irresistibly drawn to Him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), they surround Him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), they flock about Him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), follow Him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>).
<p/>The sun of love burns in His (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) heart, light and power shine from His (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) eyes, and their radiance, shed on the people, stirs their hearts with responsive love.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) holds out His (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) hands to them, blesses them, and a healing virtue comes from contact with Him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), even with His (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) garments.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) moves silently in their midst with a gentle smile of infinite compassion. An old man in the crowd, blind from childhood, cries out, 'O Lord, heal me and I shall see Thee!'
<p/>and, as it were, scales fall from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) eyes and the blind man sees Him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>). The crowd weeps and kisses the earth under His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) feet.
<p/>Children throw flowers before Him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), sing, and cry hosannah. ' It is He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)--it is He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)!' all repeat. ' It must be He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) stops at the steps of the Seville cathedral at the moment when the weeping mourners are bringing in a little open white coffin.
<p/>, it can be no one but Him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)!' In it lies a child of seven, the only daughter of a prominent citizen.
<p/>The priest, coming to meet the coffin, looks perplexed, and frowns, but the mother of the dead child throws herself at His (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) feet with a wail. '
<p/>The dead child lies hidden in flowers. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) will raise your child,' the crowd shouts to the weeping mother. If it is Thou, raise my child!'
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cries, holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands to Him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>). The procession halts, the coffin is laid on the steps at His (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) feet.
<p/>The little girl sits up in the coffin and looks round, smiling with wide- open wondering eyes, holding a bunch of white roses they had put in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand.
<p/>There are cries, sobs, confusion among the people, and at that moment the cardinal himself, the Grand Inquisitor, passes by the cathedral.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is an old man, almost ninety, tall and erect, with a withered face and sunken eyes, in which there is still a gleam of light.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is not dressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) gorgeous cardinal's robes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was the day before, when he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was burning the enemies of the Roman Church--at this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) is wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) coarse, old, monk's cassock.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) looks with compassion, and His (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) lips once more softly pronounce, `Maiden, arise!' and the maiden arises. '' At a distance behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) come his (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) gloomy assistants and slaves and the `holy guard.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) sees everything; he (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) sees them set the coffin down at His (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) feet, sees the child rise up, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) face darkens.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) stops at the sight of the crowd and watches it from a distance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) knits his (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) thick gray brows and his (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) eyes gleam with a sinister fire.
<p/>And such is his (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) power, so completely are the people cowed into submission and trembling obedience to him (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>), that the crowd immediately makes way for the guards, and in the midst of deathlike silence they lay hands on Him (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) and lead Him (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) holds out his (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>) finger and bids the guards take Him (<font color='blue'><b>Church</b></font>). The crowd instantly bows down to the earth, like one man, before the old Inquisitor.
<p/>The guards lead their prisoner to the close, gloomy vaulted prison in the ancient palace of the Holy Inquisition and shut Him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) in it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) blesses the people in silence and passes on. The day passes and is followed by the dark, burning, `breathless' night of Seville.
<p/>In the pitch darkness the iron door of the prison is suddenly opened and the Grand Inquisitor himself comes in with a light in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hand.
<p/>The air is `fragrant with laurel and lemon.' He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) is alone; the door is closed at once behind him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) stands in the doorway and for a minute or two gazes into His (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) face.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) goes up slowly, sets the light on the table and speaks. '' `Is it Thou? Thou?' but receiving no answer, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) adds at once, `Don't answer, be silent.
<p/>What canst Thou say, indeed? I know too well what Thou wouldst say. And Thou hast no right to add anything to what Thou hadst said of old.
<p/>Why, then, art Thou come to hinder us? For Thou hast come to hinder us, and Thou knowest that. But dost Thou know what will be to- morrow?
<p/>Thou art and care not to know whether it is Thou or only a semblance of Him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), but to-morrow I shall condemn Thee and burn Thee at the stake as the worst of heretics.
<p/>And the very people who have to-day kissed Thy feet, to-morrow at the faintest sign from me will rush to heap up the embers of Thy fire.
<p/>I know not who Knowest Thou that? Yes, maybe Thou knowest it,' he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) added with thoughtful penetration, never for a moment taking his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) eyes off the Prisoner.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't quite understand, Ivan. What does it mean? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha, who had been listening in silence, said with a smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it as the last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Ivan, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``if you are so corrupted by modern realism and can't stand anything fantastic.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Is it simply a wild fantasy, or a mistake on the part of the old man--some impossible quiproquo ?'' If you like it to be a case of mistaken identity, let it be so.
<p/>It is true,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``the old man was ninety, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might well be crazy over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) set idea.
<p/>It might, in fact, be simply his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ravings, the delusion of an old man of ninety, over-excited by the auto da fé of a hundred heretics the day before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have been struck by the appearance of the Prisoner. But does it matter to us after all whether it was a mistake of identity or a wild fantasy?
<p/>All that matters is that the old man should speak out, should speak openly of what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has thought in silence for ninety years.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And the Prisoner too is silent? Does He (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) and not say a word?'' '' That's inevitable in any case,'' Ivan laughed again.
<p/>'' The old man has told Him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hasn't the right to add anything to what He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has said of old.
<p/>All has been given by Thee to the Pope,' they say, `and all, therefore, is still in the Pope's hands, and there is no need for Thee to come now at all.
<p/>One may say it is the most fundamental feature of Roman Catholicism, in my opinion at least. ' Thou must not meddle for the time, at least.'
<p/>That's how they speak and write too--the Jesuits, at any rate. I have read it myself in the works of their theologians. '
<p/>Hast Thou the right to reveal to us one of the mysteries of that world from which Thou hast come?' my old man asks Him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and answers the question for Him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '
<p/>No, Thou hast not; that Thou mayest not add to what has been said of old, and mayest not take from men the freedom which Thou didst exalt when Thou wast on earth.
<p/>Whatsoever Thou revealest anew will encroach on men's freedom of faith; for it will be manifest as a miracle, and the freedom of their faith was dearer to Thee than anything in those days fifteen hundred years ago.
<p/>Didst Thou not often say then, <div class="bookquote">``I will make you free'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>? But now Thou hast seen these <div class="bookquote">``free''  (<font color='red'><b>these men</b></font>)</div>men,' the old man adds suddenly, with a pensive smile. '
<p/>Yes, we've paid dearly for it,' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes on, looking sternly at Him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), `but at last we have completed that work in Thy name.
<p/>For fifteen centuries we have been wrestling with Thy freedom, but now it is ended and over for good. Dost Thou not believe that it's over for good?
<p/>But let me tell Thee that now, to-day, people are more persuaded than ever that they have perfect freedom, yet they have brought their freedom to us and laid it humbly at our feet.
<p/>Thou lookest meekly at me and deignest not even to be wroth with me. But that has been our doing. Was this what Thou didst?
<p/>Was this Thy freedom?' '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't understand again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha broke in. '' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ironical, is he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) jesting?'' <div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) claims it as a merit for himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) Church that at last they have vanquished freedom and have done so to make men happy. '
<p/>For now' -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is speaking of the Inquisition, of course-RRB- `for the first time it has become possible to think of the happiness of men.
<p/>Thou hast had no lack of admonitions and warnings, but Thou didst not listen to those warnings; Thou didst reject the only way by which men might be made happy.
<p/>Man was created a rebel; and how can rebels be happy? Thou wast warned,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) says to Him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>). ' But, fortunately, departing Thou didst hand on the work to us.
<p/>, Thou hast given to us the right to bind and to unbind, and now, of course, Thou canst not think of taking it away.
<p/>Thou hast promised, Thou hast established by Thy word Why, then, hast Thou come to hinder us?' ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And what's the meaning of `no lack of admonitions and warnings'?
<p/>`The wise and dread spirit, the spirit of self-destruction and non- existence,' the old man goes on, `the great spirit talked with Thee in the wilderness, and we are told in the books that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``tempted''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Thee.
<p/>And could anything truer be said than what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) revealed to Thee in three questions and what Thou didst reject, and what in the books is called <div class="bookquote">``the temptation'' (<font color='red'><b>Thee</b></font>)</div>?
<p/>And yet if there has ever been on earth a real stupendous miracle, it took place on that day, on the day of the three temptations.
<p/>'' asked Alyosha. '' Why, that's the chief part of what the old man must say. '' Is that so? The statement of those three questions was itself the miracle.
<p/>If it were possible to imagine simply for the sake of argument that those three questions of the dread spirit had perished utterly from the books, and that we had to restore them and to invent them anew, and to do so had gathered together all the wise men of the earth--rulers, chief priests, learned men, philosophers, poets--and had set them the task to invent three questions, such as would not only fit the occasion, but express in three words, three human phrases, the whole future history of the world and of humanity--dost
<p/>Thou believe that all the wisdom of the earth united could have invented anything in depth and force equal to the three questions which were actually put to Thee then by the wise and mighty spirit in the wilderness?
<p/>From those questions alone, from the miracle of their statement, we can see that we have here to do not with the fleeting human intelligence, but with the absolute and eternal.
<p/>For in those three questions the whole subsequent history of mankind is, as it were, brought together into one whole, and foretold, and in them are united all the unsolved historical contradictions of human nature.
<p/>At the time it could not be so clear, since the future was unknown; but now that fifteen hundred years have passed, we see that everything in those three questions was so justly divined and foretold, and has been so truly fulfilled, that nothing can be added to them or taken from them.
<p/>'' `Judge Thyself who was right--Thou or he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) who questioned Thee then? Remember the first question; its meaning, in other words, was this:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou wouldst go into the world, and art going with empty hands, with some promise of freedom which men in their simplicity and their natural unruliness cannot even understand, which they fear and dread--for nothing has ever been more insupportable for a man and a human society than freedom.
<p/>Turn them into bread, and mankind will run after Thee like a flock of sheep, grateful and obedient, though for ever trembling, lest Thou withdraw Thy hand and deny them Thy bread.
<p/>But Thou wouldst not deprive man of freedom and didst reject the offer, thinking, what is that freedom worth, if obedience is bought with bread?
<p/>But seest Thou these stones in this parched and barren wilderness? ''  (<font color='red'><b>that man</b></font>)</div>Thou didst reply that man lives not by bread alone.
<p/>But dost Thou know that for the sake of that earthly bread the spirit of the earth will rise up against Thee and will strive with Thee and overcome Thee, and all will follow him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), crying, <div class="bookquote">``Who can compare with this beast?
<p/>Dost Thou know that the ages will pass, and humanity will proclaim by the lips of their sages that there is no crime, and therefore no sin; there is only hunger?
<p/>that's what they'll write on the banner, which they will raise against Thee, and with which they will destroy Thy temple.
<p/>Where Thy temple stood will rise a new building; the terrible tower of Babel will be built again, and though, like the one of old, it will not be finished, yet Thou mightest have prevented that new tower and have cut short the sufferings of men for a thousand years; for they will come back to us after a thousand years of agony with their tower.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) has given us fire from heaven! ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Feed men, and then ask of them virtue! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They will seek us again, hidden underground in the catacombs, for we shall be again persecuted and tortured.
<p/>They will find us and cry to us, <div class="bookquote">``Feed us, for those who have promised us fire from heaven haven't given it!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And then we shall finish building their tower, for he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) finishes the building who feeds them. And we alone shall feed them in Thy name, declaring falsely that it is in Thy name.
<p/>Oh, never, never can they feed themselves without us! No science will give them bread so long as they remain free.
<p/>In the end they will lay their freedom at our feet, and say to us, <div class="bookquote">``Make us your slaves, but feed us.
<p/>They will understand themselves, at last, that freedom and bread enough for all are inconceivable together, for never, never will they be able to share between them!
<p/>Thou didst promise them the bread of Heaven, but, I repeat again, can it compare with earthly bread in the eyes of the weak, ever sinful and ignoble race of man?
<p/>And if for the sake of the bread of Heaven thousands shall follow Thee, what is to become of the millions and tens of thousands of millions of creatures who will not have the strength to forego the earthly bread for the sake of the heavenly?
<p/>Or dost Thou care only for the tens of thousands of the great and strong, while the millions, numerous as the sands of the sea, who are weak but love Thee, must exist only for the sake of the great and strong?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They will be convinced, too, that they can never be free, for they are weak, vicious, worthless and rebellious. No, we care for the weak too.
<p/>They will marvel at us and look on us as gods, because we are ready to endure the freedom which they have found so dreadful and to rule over them--so awful it will seem to them to be free.
<p/>They are sinful and rebellious, but in the end they too will become obedient. But we shall tell them that we are Thy servants and rule them in Thy name.
<p/>We shall deceive them again, for we will not let Thee come to us again. That deception will be our suffering, for we shall be forced to lie.
<p/>This is the significance of the first question in the wilderness, and this is what Thou hast rejected for the sake of that freedom which Thou hast exalted above everything.
<p/>'' ' Yet in this question lies hid the great secret of this world. Choosing <div class="bookquote">``bread,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Thou wouldst have satisfied the universal and everlasting craving of humanity--to find some one to worship.
<p/>So long as man remains free he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strives for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find some one to worship.
<p/>But man seeks to worship what is established beyond dispute, so that all men would agree at once to worship it.
<p/>For these pitiful creatures are concerned not only to find what one or the other can worship, but to find something that all would believe in and worship; what is essential is that all may be together in it.
<p/>This craving for community of worship is the chief misery of every man individually and of all humanity from the beginning of time.
<p/>They have set up gods and challenged one another, <div class="bookquote">``Put away your gods and come and worship ours, or we will kill you and your gods!
<p/>And so it will be to the end of the world, even when gods disappear from the earth; they will fall down before idols just the same.
<p/>Thou couldst not but have known, this fundamental secret of human nature, but Thou didst reject the one infallible banner which was offered Thee to make all men bow down to Thee alone--the banner of earthly bread; and Thou hast rejected it for the sake of freedom and the bread of Heaven.
<p/>For the sake of common worship they've slain each other with the sword. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Thou didst know, Behold what Thou didst further.
<p/>I tell Thee that man is tormented by no greater anxiety than to find some one quickly to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can hand over that gift of freedom with which the ill-fated creature is born.
<p/>And all again in the name of freedom! But only one who can appease their conscience can take over their freedom.
<p/>In bread there was offered Thee an invincible banner; give bread, and man will worship thee, for nothing is more certain than bread.
<p/>But if some one else gains possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conscience-- oh! then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will cast away Thy bread and follow after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who has ensnared his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conscience.
<p/>In that Thou wast right. For the secret of man's being is not only to live but to have something to live for.
<p/>Without a stable conception of the object of life, man would not consent to go on living, and would rather destroy himself than remain on earth, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had bread in abundance.
<p/>Didst Thou forget that man prefers peace, and even death, to freedom of choice in the knowledge of good and evil?
<p/>That is true. But what happened? Instead of taking men's freedom from them, Thou didst make it greater than ever! Nothing is more seductive for man than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) freedom of conscience, but nothing is a greater cause of suffering.
<p/>And behold, instead of giving a firm foundation for setting the conscience of man at rest for ever, Thou didst choose all that is exceptional, vague and enigmatic; Thou didst choose what was utterly beyond the strength of men, acting as though Thou didst not love them at all--
<p/>Instead of taking possession of men's freedom, Thou didst increase it, and burdened the spiritual kingdom of mankind with its sufferings for ever.
<p/>Thou who didst come to give Thy life for them! Thou didst desire man's free love, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should follow Thee freely, enticed and taken captive by Thee.
<p/>In place of the rigid ancient law, man must hereafter with free heart decide for himself what is good and what is evil, having only Thy image before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guide.
<p/>But didst Thou not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would at last reject even Thy image and Thy truth, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is weighed down with the fearful burden of free choice?
<p/>They will cry aloud at last that the truth is not in Thee, for they could not have been left in greater confusion and suffering than Thou hast caused, laying upon them so many cares and unanswerable problems.
<p/>'' `So that, in truth, Thou didst Thyself lay the foundation for the destruction of Thy kingdom, and no one is more to blame for it.
<p/>There are three powers, three powers alone, able to conquer and to hold captive for ever the conscience of these impotent rebels for their happiness--those forces are miracle, mystery and authority.
<p/>Yet what was offered Thee? Thou hast rejected all three and hast set the example for doing so. When the wise and dread spirit set Thee on the pinnacle of the temple and said to Thee,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Thou wouldst know whether Thou art the Son of God then cast Thyself down, for it is written: the angels shall hold him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) up lest he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fall and bruise himself, and Thou shalt know then whether Thou art the Son of God and shalt
<p/>prove then how great is Thy faith in Thy Father. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Thee</b></font>)</div>But Thou didst refuse and wouldst not cast Thyself down.
<p/>Oh, Thou didst know then that in taking one step, in making one movement to cast Thyself down, Thou wouldst be tempting God and have lost all Thy faith in Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and wouldst have been dashed to pieces against that earth which Thou didst come to save.
<p/>Oh, of course, Thou didst proudly and well, like God; but the weak, unruly race of men, are they gods? And the wise spirit that tempted Thee would have rejoiced.
<p/>But I ask again, are there many like Thee? And couldst Thou believe for one moment that men, too, could face such a temptation?
<p/>Is the nature of men such, that they can reject miracle, and at the great moments of their life, the moments of their deepest, most agonizing spiritual difficulties, cling only to the free verdict of the heart?
<p/>Oh, Thou didst know that Thy deed would be recorded in books, would be handed down to remote times and the utmost ends of the earth, and
<p/>But Thou didst not know that when man rejects miracle he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rejects God too; for man seeks not so much God as the miraculous.
<p/>And as man cannot bear to be without the miraculous, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will create new miracles of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own for himself, and will worship deeds of sorcery and witchcraft, though he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) might be a hundred times over a rebel, heretic and infidel.
<p/>Thou didst not come down from the Cross when they shouted to Thee, mocking and reviling Thee, <div class="bookquote">``Come down from the cross and we will believe that Thou art He (<font color='blue'><b>Cross</b></font>).
<p/>Thou didst hope that man, following Thee, would cling to God and not ask for a miracle. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Thee</b></font>)</div>Thou didst not come down, for again
<p/>Thou didst crave for free love and not the base raptures of the slave before the might that has overawed him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) for ever.
<p/>Thou wouldst not enslave man by a miracle, and didst crave faith given freely, not based on miracle. But Thou didst think too highly of men therein, for they are slaves, of course, though rebellious by nature.
<p/>Look round and judge; fifteen centuries have passed, look upon them. Whom hast Thou raised up to Thyself? I swear, man is weaker and baser by nature than Thou hast believed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!
<p/>By showing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so much respect, Thou didst, as it were, cease to feel for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), for Thou didst ask far too much from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--
<p/>Can he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), can he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do what Thou didst? Thou who hast loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more than Thyself! Respecting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) less, Thou wouldst have asked less of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>That would have been more like love, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) burden would have been lighter. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is weak and vile. What though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is everywhere now rebelling against our power, and proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rebellion?
<p/>It is the pride of a child and a schoolboy. They are little children rioting and barring out the teacher at school.
<p/>But their childish delight will end; it will cost them dear. They will cast down temples and drench the earth with blood.
<p/>But they will see at last, the foolish children, that, though they are rebels, they are impotent rebels, unable to keep up their own rebellion.
<p/>Bathed in their foolish tears, they will recognize at last that He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who created them rebels must have meant to mock at them.
<p/>They will say this in despair, and their utterance will be a blasphemy which will make them more unhappy still, for man's nature cannot bear blasphemy, and in the end always avenges it on itself.
<p/>And so unrest, confusion and unhappiness--that is the present lot of man after Thou didst bear so much for their freedom!
<p/>The great prophet tells in vision and in image, that he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) saw all those who took part in the first resurrection and that there were of each tribe twelve thousand.
<p/>They had borne Thy cross, they had endured scores of years in the barren, hungry wilderness, living upon locusts and roots--and Thou mayest indeed point with pride at those children of freedom, of free love, of free and splendid sacrifice for Thy name.
<p/>But if there were so many of them, they must have been not men but gods. But remember that they were only some thousands; and what of the rest?
<p/>And how are the other weak ones to blame, because they could not endure what the strong have endured? How is the weak soul to blame that it is unable to receive such terrible gifts?
<p/>Canst Thou have simply come to the elect and for the elect? But if so, it is a mystery and we cannot understand it.
<p/>And if it is a mystery, we too have a right to preach a mystery, and to teach them that it's not the free judgment of their hearts, not love that matters, but a mystery which they must follow blindly, even against their conscience.
<p/>And men rejoiced that they were again led like sheep, and that the terrible gift that had brought them such suffering was, at last, lifted from their hearts.
<p/>So we have done. We have corrected Thy work and have founded it upon miracle , mystery and authority . Were we right teaching them this?
<p/>Did we not love mankind, so meekly acknowledging their feebleness, lovingly lightening their burden, and permitting their weak nature even sin with our sanction?
<p/>Speak! Why hast Thou come now to hinder us? And why dost Thou look silently and searchingly at me with Thy mild eyes?
<p/>Be angry. I don't want Thy love, for I love Thee not. And what use is it for me to hide anything from Thee?
<p/>Don't I know to Whom I am speaking? All that I can say is known to Thee already. And is it for me to conceal from Thee our mystery?
<p/>Perhaps it is Thy will to hear it from my lips. Listen, then. We are not working with Thee, but with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) --that is our mystery.
<p/>Just eight centuries ago, we took from him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) what Thou didst reject with scorn, that last gift he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) offered Thee, showing Thee all the kingdoms of the earth.
<p/>We took from him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) Rome and the sword of Cćsar, and proclaimed ourselves sole rulers of the earth, though hitherto we have not been able to complete our work.
<p/>It's long-- eight centuries--since we have been on his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) side and not on Thine. But whose fault is that? Oh, the work is only beginning, but it has begun.
<p/>It has long to await completion and the earth has yet much to suffer, but we shall triumph and shall be Cćsars, and then we shall plan the universal happiness of man.
<p/>Hadst Thou accepted that last counsel of the mighty spirit, Thou wouldst have accomplished all that man seeks on earth--that is, some one to worship, some one to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conscience, and some means of uniting all in one unanimous and harmonious ant-heap, for the craving for universal unity is the third and last anguish of men.
<p/>But Thou mightest have taken even then the sword of Cćsar. Why didst Thou reject that last gift? Mankind as a whole has always striven to organize a universal state.
<p/>There have been many great nations with great histories, but the more highly they were developed the more unhappy they were, for they felt more acutely than other people the craving for world-wide union.
<p/>The great conquerors, Timours and Ghenghis-Khans, whirled like hurricanes over the face of the earth striving to subdue its people, and they too were but the unconscious expression of the same craving for universal unity.
<p/>Hadst Thou taken the world and Cćsar's purple, Thou wouldst have founded the universal state and have given universal peace. For who can rule men if not he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) who holds their conscience and their bread in his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hands?
<p/>We have taken the sword of Cćsar, and in taking it, of course, have rejected Thee and followed him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) . Oh, ages are yet to come of the confusion of free thought, of their science and cannibalism.
<p/>For having begun to build their tower of Babel without us, they will end, of course, with cannibalism. But then the beast will crawl to us and lick our feet and spatter them with tears of blood.
<p/>And we shall sit upon the beast and raise the cup, and on it will be written, <div class="bookquote">``Mystery. ''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>But then, and only then, the reign of peace and happiness will come for men.
<p/>And besides, how many of those elect, those mighty ones who could become elect, have grown weary waiting for Thee, and have transferred and will transfer the powers of their spirit and the warmth of their heart to the other camp, and end by raising their free banner against Thee.
<p/>Thou art proud of Thine elect, but Thou hast only the elect, while we give rest to all. Thou didst Thyself lift up that banner.
<p/>Oh, we shall persuade them that they will only become free when they renounce their freedom to us and submit to us.
<p/>But with us all will be happy and will no more rebel nor destroy one another as under Thy freedom. And shall we be right or shall we be lying?
<p/>They will be convinced that we are right, for they will remember the horrors of slavery and confusion to which Thy freedom brought them.
<p/>Freedom, free thought and science, will lead them into such straits and will bring them face to face with such marvels and insoluble mysteries, that some of them, the fierce and rebellious, will destroy themselves, others, rebellious but weak, will destroy one another, while the rest, weak and unhappy, will crawl fawning to our feet and whine to us: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, you were right, you alone possess His (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) mystery, and we come back to you, save us from ourselves!''
 (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div><p/>'' `Receiving bread from us, they will see clearly that we take the bread made by their hands from them, to give it to them, without any miracle.
<p/>They will see that we do not change the stones to bread, but in truth they will be more thankful for taking it from our hands than for the bread itself!
<p/>For they will remember only too well that in old days, without our help, even the bread they made turned to stones in their hands, while since they have come back to us, the very stones have turned to bread in their hands.
<p/>Too, too well will they know the value of complete submission! And until men know that, they will be unhappy. Who is most to blame for their not knowing it?--speak!
<p/>Who scattered the flock and sent it astray on unknown paths? But the flock will come together again and will submit once more, and then it will be once for all.
<p/>Oh, we shall persuade them at last not to be proud, for Thou didst lift them up and thereby taught them to be proud.
<p/>We shall show them that they are weak, that they are only pitiful children, but that childlike happiness is the sweetest of all.
<p/>They will become timid and will look to us and huddle close to us in fear, as chicks to the hen.
<p/>They will marvel at us and will be awe-stricken before us, and will be proud at our being so powerful and clever, that we have been able to subdue such a turbulent flock of thousands of millions.
<p/>They will tremble impotently before our wrath, their minds will grow fearful, they will be quick to shed tears like women and children, but they will be just as ready at a sign from us to pass to laughter and rejoicing, to happy mirth and childish song.
<p/>Yes, we shall set them to work, but in their leisure hours we shall make their life like a child's game, with children's songs and innocent dance.
<p/>Oh, we shall allow them even sin, they are weak and helpless, and they will love us like children because we allow them to sin.
<p/>We shall tell them that every sin will be expiated, if it is done with our permission, that we allow them to sin because we love them, and the punishment for these sins we take upon ourselves.
<p/>And we shall take it upon ourselves, and they will adore us as their saviors who have taken on themselves their sins before God.
<p/>Then we shall give them the quiet humble happiness of weak creatures such as they are by nature. And they will have no secrets from us.
<p/>We shall allow or forbid them to live with their wives and mistresses, to have or not to have children--according to whether they have been obedient or disobedient--and they will submit to us gladly and cheerfully.
<p/>The most painful secrets of their conscience, all, all they will bring to us, and we shall have an answer for all.
<p/>And they will be glad to believe our answer, for it will save them from the great anxiety and terrible agony they endure at present in making a free decision for themselves.
<p/>And all will be happy, all the millions of creatures except the hundred thousand who rule over them. For only we, we who guard the mystery, shall be unhappy.
<p/>There will be thousands of millions of happy babes, and a hundred thousand sufferers who have taken upon themselves the curse of the knowledge of good and evil.
<p/>Peacefully they will die, peacefully they will expire in Thy name, and beyond the grave they will find nothing but death.
<p/>But we shall keep the secret, and for their happiness we shall allure them with the reward of heaven and eternity.
<p/>Though if there were anything in the other world, it certainly would not be for such as they. It is prophesied that Thou wilt come again in victory
<p/>, Thou wilt come with Thy chosen, the proud and strong, but we will say that they have only saved themselves, but we have saved all.
<p/>We are told that the harlot who sits upon the beast, and holds in her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) hands the mystery , shall be put to shame, that the weak will rise up again, and will rend her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) royal purple and will strip naked her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) loathsome body.
<p/>But then I will stand up and point out to Thee the thousand millions of happy children who have known no sin.
<p/>And we who have taken their sins upon us for their happiness will stand up before Thee and say: ``Judge us if Thou canst and darest.
<p/>Know that I too have been in the wilderness, I too have lived on roots and locusts, I too prized the freedom with which Thou hast blessed men, and I too was striving to stand among Thy elect, among the strong and powerful, thirsting <div class="bookquote">``to make up the number.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Know that I fear Thee not. '' But I awakened and would not serve madness. I turned back and joined the ranks of those who have corrected Thy work .
<p/>I left the proud and went back to the humble, for the happiness of the humble. What I say to Thee will come to pass, and our dominion will be built up.
<p/>Thou shalt see that obedient flock who at a sign from me will hasten to heap up the hot cinders about the pile on which I shall burn Thee for coming to hinder us.
<p/>I repeat, to-morrow For if any one has ever deserved our fires, it is Thou. To-morrow I shall burn Thee. Dixi. '
<p/>'' Ivan stopped. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was carried away as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) talked, and spoke with excitement; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had finished, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) suddenly smiled.
<p/>Alyosha had listened in silence; towards the end he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was greatly moved and seemed several times on the point of interrupting, but restrained himself.
<p/>Now his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) words came with a rush. '' But ... that's absurd! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) cried, flushing. '' Your poem is in praise of Jesus, not in blame of Him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>)--as you meant it to be.
<p/>And who will believe you about freedom? Is that the way to understand it? That's not the idea of it in the Orthodox Church....
<p/>That's Rome, and not even the whole of Rome , it's false--those are the worst of the Catholics, the Inquisitors, the Jesuits!
<p/>... And there could not be such a fantastic creature as your Inquisitor. What are these sins of mankind they take on themselves?
<p/>Who are these keepers of the mystery who have taken some curse upon themselves for the happiness of mankind? When have they been seen?
<p/>We know the Jesuits, they are spoken ill of, but surely they are not what you describe? They are not that at all, not at all....
<p/>They are simply the Romish army for the earthly sovereignty of the world in the future, with the Pontiff of Rome for Emperor ... that's their ideal, but there's no sort of mystery or lofty melancholy about it....
<p/>It's simple lust of power, of filthy earthly gain, of domination--something like a universal serfdom with them as masters--that's all they stand for.
<p/>They don't even believe in God perhaps. Your suffering Inquisitor is a mere fantasy.'' <div class="bookquote">``Stay, stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>laughed Ivan, <div class="bookquote">``how hot you are!
<p/>But allow me to say: do you really think that the Roman Catholic movement of the last centuries is actually nothing but the lust of power, of filthy earthly gain?
<p/>A fantasy you say, let it be so! Of course it's a fantasy. Is that Father Paďssy's teaching?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>'' No, no, on the contrary, Father Paďssy did once say something rather the same as you ...
<p/>but of course it's not the same, not a bit the same,'' Alyosha hastily corrected himself. '' A precious admission, in spite of your `not a bit the same.'
<p/>I ask you why your Jesuits and Inquisitors have united simply for vile material gain? Why can there not be among them one martyr oppressed by great sorrow and loving humanity?
<p/>You see, only suppose that there was one such man among all those who desire nothing but filthy material gain--if there's only one like my old Inquisitor, who had himself eaten roots in the desert and made frenzied efforts to subdue his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flesh to make himself free and perfect.
<p/>But yet all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved humanity, and suddenly his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes were opened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw that it is no great moral blessedness to attain perfection and freedom, if at the same time one gains the conviction that millions of God's creatures have been created as a mockery, that they will never be capable of using their freedom, that these poor rebels can never turn into giants to complete the tower, that it was not for such geese that the great idealist dreamt his (<font color='blue'><b>idealist</b></font>) dream of harmony.
<p/>Seeing all that he (<font color='blue'><b>idealist</b></font>) turned back and joined--the clever people. Surely that could have happened?'' '' Joined whom, what clever people?
<p/>'' cried Alyosha, completely carried away. '' They have no such great cleverness and no mysteries and secrets.... Perhaps nothing but Atheism, that's all their secret.
<p/>Your Inquisitor does not believe in God, that's his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) secret!'' '' What if it is so! At last you have guessed it.
<p/>It's perfectly true, it's true that that's the whole secret, but isn't that suffering, at least for a man like that, who has wasted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole life in the desert and yet could not shake off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) incurable love of humanity?
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old age he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached the clear conviction that nothing but the advice of the great dread spirit could build up any tolerable sort of life for the feeble, unruly, `incomplete, empirical creatures created in jest.'
<p/>And so, convinced of this, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must follow the counsel of the wise spirit, the dread spirit of death and destruction, and therefore accept lying and deception, and lead men consciously to death and destruction, and yet deceive them all the way so that they may not notice where they are being led, that the poor blind creatures may at least on the way think themselves happy.
<p/>And note, the deception is in the name of Him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in Whose ideal the old man had so fervently believed all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life long.
<p/>And if only one such stood at the head of the whole army `filled with the lust of power only for the sake of filthy gain'--would not one such be enough to make a tragedy?
<p/>More than that, one such standing at the head is enough to create the actual leading idea of the Roman Church with all its armies and Jesuits, its highest idea.
<p/>I tell you frankly that I firmly believe that there has always been such a man among those who stood at the head of the movement.
<p/>Who knows, perhaps the spirit of that accursed old man who loves mankind so obstinately in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own way, is to be found even now in a whole multitude of such old men, existing not by chance but by agreement, as a secret league formed long ago for the guarding of the mystery, to guard it from the weak and the unhappy, so as to make them happy.
<p/>Is not that tragic? Who knows, there may have been some such even among the Roman Popes. No doubt it is so, and so it must be indeed.
<p/>I fancy that even among the Masons there's something of the same mystery at the bottom, and that that's why the Catholics so detest the Masons as their rivals breaking up the unity of the idea, while it is so essential that there should be one flock and one shepherd....
<p/>But from the way I defend my idea I might be an author impatient of your criticism. Enough of it. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are perhaps a Mason yourself!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>broke suddenly from Alyosha. '' You don't believe in God,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) added, speaking this time very sorrowfully.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fancied besides that his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) brother was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ironically. '' How does your poem end? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) asked, suddenly looking down. ''
<p/>Or was it the end?'' <div class="bookquote">``I meant to end it like this. When the Inquisitor ceased speaking he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) waited some time for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) Prisoner to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) saw that the Prisoner had listened intently all the time, looking gently in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face and evidently not wishing to reply.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) silence weighed down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). The old man longed for Him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to say something, however bitter and terrible. But He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suddenly approached the old man in silence and softly kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bloodless aged lips.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to the door, opened it, and said to Him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): `Go, and come no more ... come not at all, never, never!'
<p/>That was all His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answer. The old man shuddered. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips moved. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let Him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out into the dark alleys of the town.
<p/>The Prisoner went away.''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>'' And the old man?'' '' The kiss glows in his (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) heart, but the old man adheres to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) idea.''
<p/>'' And you with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), you too?'' cried Alyosha, mournfully. Ivan laughed. '' Why, it's all nonsense, Alyosha. It's only a senseless poem of a senseless student, who could never write two lines of verse.
<p/>Surely you don't suppose I am going straight off to the Jesuits, to join the men who are correcting His (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) work?
<p/>I told you, all I want is to live on to thirty, and then ... dash the cup to the ground!''
<p/>Why do you take it so seriously? Good Lord, it's no business of mine. '' But the little sticky leaves, and the precious tombs, and the blue sky, and the woman you love!
<p/>How will you live, how will you love them?'' Alyosha cried sorrowfully. '' With such a hell in your heart and your head, how can you?
<p/>No, that's just what you are going away for, to join them ... if not , you will kill yourself, you can't endure it!''
<p/>'' There is a strength to endure everything,'' Ivan said with a cold smile. '' What strength?'' '' The strength of the Karamazovs--the strength of the Karamazov baseness.''
<p/>'' To sink into debauchery, to stifle your soul with corruption, yes?'' <div class="bookquote">``Possibly even that ... only perhaps till I am thirty
<p/>I shall escape it, and then-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How will you escape it? By what will you escape it? That's impossible with your ideas.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In the Karamazov way, again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' `Everything is lawful,' you mean? Everything is lawful, is that it?'' Ivan scowled, and all at once turned strangely pale.
<p/>'' Ah, you've caught up yesterday's phrase, which so offended Miüsov--and which Dmitri pounced upon so naďvely, and paraphrased! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) smiled queerly.
<p/>'' Yes, if you like, `everything is lawful' since the word has been said. I won't deny it. And Mitya's version isn't bad.
<p/>'' Alyosha looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) in silence. '' I thought that going away from here I have you at least,'' Ivan said suddenly, with unexpected feeling;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but now I see that there is no place for me even in your heart, my dear hermit. The formula, `all is lawful,' I won't renounce--
<p/>will you renounce me for that, yes? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha got up, went to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) and softly kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) on the lips.
<p/>'' That's plagiarism,'' cried Ivan, highly delighted. '' You stole that from my poem. Thank you though. Get up, Alyosha, it's time we were going, both of us.
<p/>Listen, Alyosha,'' Ivan began in a resolute voice, <div class="bookquote">``if I am really able to care for the sticky little leaves I shall only love them, remembering you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>They went out, but stopped when they reached the entrance of the restaurant. '' It's enough for me that you are somewhere here, and I shan't lose my desire for life yet.
<p/>Is that enough for you? Take it as a declaration of love if you like. And now you go to the right
<p/>and I to the left. And it's enough, do you hear, enough. I mean even if I don't go away to-morrow -LRB-I think I certainly shall go-RRB-
<p/>And about Dmitri too, I ask you specially, never speak to me again,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) added, with sudden irritation; <div class="bookquote">``it's all exhausted, it has all been said over and over again, hasn't it?
<p/>and we meet again, don't say a word more on these subjects. I beg that particularly. And I'll make you one promise in return for it.
<p/>When at thirty, I want to `dash the cup to the ground,' wherever I may be I'll come to have one more talk with you,
<p/>even though it were from America, you may be sure of that. I'll come on purpose. It will be very interesting to have a look at you, to see what you'll be by that time.
<p/>It's rather a solemn promise, you see. And we really may be parting for seven years or ten. Come, go now to your Pater Seraphicus, he (<font color='blue'><b>Seraphicus</b></font>) is dying.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Seraphicus</b></font>) dies without you, you will be angry with me for having kept you. Good-by, kiss me once more ; that's right, now go.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Ivan turned suddenly and went his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) way without looking back. It was just as Dmitri had left Alyosha the day before, though the parting had been very different.
<p/>The strange resemblance flashed like an arrow through Alyosha's mind in the distress and dejection of that moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) waited a little, looking after his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) brother.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) suddenly noticed that Ivan swayed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) walked and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) right shoulder looked lower than his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) left. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had never noticed it before.
<p/>It was nearly dark, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) felt almost frightened; something new was growing up in him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) could not account.
<p/>The wind had risen again as on the previous evening, and the ancient pines murmured gloomily about him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) entered the hermitage copse.
<p/>But all at once he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) turned too, and almost ran to the monastery. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) almost ran. '' Pater Seraphicus--he (<font color='blue'><b>Seraphicus</b></font>) got that name from somewhere--where from?''
<p/>Alyosha wondered. '' Ivan, poor Ivan, and when shall I see you again?... Here is the hermitage. Yes, yes, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is, Pater Seraphicus
<p/>Several times afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Seraphicus</b></font>) wondered how he (<font color='blue'><b>Seraphicus</b></font>) could on leaving Ivan so completely forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother Dmitri, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had that morning, only a few hours before, so firmly resolved to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) and not to give up doing so, even should he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) be unable to return to the monastery that night.
<p/>, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) will save me--from him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) and for ever!'' Chapter VI. For Awhile A Very Obscure One And Ivan, on parting from Alyosha, went home to Fyodor Pavlovitch's house.
<p/>But, strange to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was overcome by insufferable depression, which grew greater at every step he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) took towards the house.
<p/>There was nothing strange in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) being depressed; what was strange was that Ivan could not have said what was the cause of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had often been depressed before, and there was nothing surprising at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) feeling so at such a moment, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had broken off with everything that had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) here, and was preparing that day to make a new start and enter upon a new, unknown future.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) would again be as solitary as ever, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had great hopes, and great--too great--expectations from life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) could not have given any definite account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hopes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) expectations, or even his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) desires.
<p/>Yet at that moment, though the apprehension of the new and unknown certainly found place in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) heart, what was worrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was something quite different.
<p/>Quite likely; I am so sick of it; and though it's the last time I shall cross its hateful threshold, still I loathe it...
<p/>'' Is it loathing for my father's house? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wondered. '' No, it's not that either. Is it the parting with Alyosha and the conversation I had with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?
<p/>For so many years I've been silent with the whole world and not deigned to speak, and all of a sudden I reel off a rigmarole like that.
<p/>It certainly might have been the youthful vexation of youthful inexperience and vanity--vexation at having failed to express himself, especially with such a being as Alyosha, on whom his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart had certainly been reckoning.
<p/>No doubt that came in, that vexation, it must have done indeed; but yet that was not it, that was not it either.
<p/>'' '' I feel sick with depression and yet I can't tell what I want. Better not think, perhaps. '' Ivan tried <div class="bookquote">``not to think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>but that, too, was no use.
<p/>Some person or thing seemed to be standing out somewhere, just as something will sometimes obtrude itself upon the eye, and though one may be so busy with work or conversation that for a long time one does not notice it, yet it irritates and almost torments one till at last one realizes, and removes the offending object, often quite a trifling and ridiculous one--some article left about in the wrong place, a handkerchief on the floor, a book not replaced on the shelf, and so on.
<p/>At last, feeling very cross and ill-humored, Ivan arrived home, and suddenly, about fifteen paces from the garden gate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) guessed what was fretting and worrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>On a bench in the gateway the valet Smerdyakov was sitting enjoying the coolness of the evening, and at the first glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) Ivan knew that the valet Smerdyakov was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) mind, and that it was this man that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) soul loathed.
<p/>What made his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) depression so vexatious and irritating was that it had a kind of casual, external character--he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) felt that. It all dawned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) suddenly and became clear.
<p/>Just before, when Alyosha had been telling him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) meeting with Smerdyakov, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had felt a sudden twinge of gloom and loathing, which had immediately stirred responsive anger in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) heart.
<p/>Afterwards, as he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) talked, Smerdyakov had been forgotten for the time; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mind, and as soon as Ivan parted with Alyosha and was walking home, the forgotten sensation began to obtrude itself again.
<p/>'' Is it possible that a miserable, contemptible creature like that can worry me so much? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) wondered, with insufferable irritation.
<p/>It was true that Ivan had come of late to feel an intense dislike for the man, especially during the last few days.
<p/>Perhaps this hatred was accentuated by the fact that when Ivan first came to the neighborhood he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had felt quite differently.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had even begun to notice in himself a growing feeling that was almost of hatred for the creature. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had taken a marked interest in Smerdyakov, and had even thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) very original.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), although he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had always wondered at a certain incoherence, or rather restlessness, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) mind, and could not understand what it was that so continually and insistently worked upon the brain of <div class="bookquote">``the contemplative.
<p/>They discussed philosophical questions and even how there could have been light on the first day when the sun, moon, and stars were only created on the fourth day, and how that was to be understood.
<p/>But Ivan soon saw that, though the sun, moon, and stars might be an interesting subject, yet that it was quite secondary to Smerdyakov, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was looking for something altogether different.
<p/>In one way and another, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) began to betray a boundless vanity, and a wounded vanity, too, and that Ivan disliked.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It had first given rise to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) aversion. Later on, there had been trouble in the house. Grushenka had come on the scene, and there had been the scandals with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother Dmitri--they discussed that, too.
<p/>But though Smerdyakov always talked of that with great excitement, it was impossible to discover what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) desired to come of it.
<p/>There was, in fact, something surprising in the illogicality and incoherence of some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) desires, accidentally betrayed and always vaguely expressed.
<p/>Smerdyakov was always inquiring, putting certain indirect but obviously premeditated questions, but what his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) object was he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) did not explain, and usually at the most important moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) would break off and relapse into silence or pass to another subject.
<p/>But what finally irritated Ivan most and confirmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) dislike for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was the peculiar, revolting familiarity which Smerdyakov began to show more and more markedly.
<p/>Not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) forgot himself and was rude; on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) always spoke very respectfully, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had obviously begun to consider--goodness knows why!--that there was some sort of understanding between him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) and Ivan Fyodorovitch.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) always spoke in a tone that suggested that those two had some kind of compact, some secret between them, that had at some time been expressed on both sides, only known to them and beyond the comprehension of those around them.
<p/>But for a long while Ivan did not recognize the real cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) growing dislike and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had only lately realized what was at the root of it.
<p/>With a feeling of disgust and irritation he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) tried to pass in at the gate without speaking or looking at Smerdyakov.
<p/>But Smerdyakov rose from the bench, and from that action alone, Ivan knew instantly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) wanted particularly to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>Ivan looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) and stopped, and the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) did stop, instead of passing by, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) meant to the minute before, drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) to fury.
<p/>With anger and repulsion he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) looked at Smerdyakov's emasculate, sickly face, with the little curls combed forward on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) forehead. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) left eye winked
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) grinned as if to say, <div class="bookquote">``Where are you going? You won't pass by; you see that we two clever people have something to say to each other.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was on the tip of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) tongue, but to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) profound astonishment he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) heard himself say, <div class="bookquote">``Is my father still asleep, or has he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) waked?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked the question softly and meekly, to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own surprise, and at once, again to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own surprise, sat down on the bench.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Ivan shook. '' Get away, miserable idiot. What have I to do with you? '' For an instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) felt almost frightened; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) remembered it afterwards.
<p/>Smerdyakov stood facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hands behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) back, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) with assurance and almost severity. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) honor is still asleep,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) articulated deliberately -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``You were the first to speak, not I,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) seemed to say-RRB-.
<p/>I am surprised at you, sir,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) added, after a pause, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) eyes affectedly, setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) right foot forward, and playing with the tip of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) polished boot.
<p/>Ivan asked abruptly and sullenly, doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) utmost to restrain himself, and suddenly realizing, with disgust, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was feeling intense curiosity and would not, on any account, have gone away without satisfying it.
<p/>'' '' Why are you surprised at me?'' '' Why don't you go to Tchermashnya, sir?'' Smerdyakov suddenly raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) eyes and smiled familiarly.
<p/>Why I smile you must understand of yourself, if you are a clever man,'' his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) screwed-up left eye seemed to say.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch himself has so begged you to,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) said at last, slowly and apparently attaching no significance to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) answer.
<p/>'' '' Why should I go to Tchermashnya? '' Ivan asked in surprise. Smerdyakov was silent again. '' '' I put you off with a secondary reason,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) seemed to suggest, <div class="bookquote">``simply to say something.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Smerdyakov drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) right foot up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) left, pulled himself up, but still looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) with the same serenity and the same little smile.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damn you! Speak out what you want!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan cried angrily at last, passing from meekness to violence. '' Substantially nothing--but just by way of conversation.
<p/>Ivan knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) ought to get up and show anger, and Smerdyakov stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) and seemed to be waiting as though to see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) would be angry or not.
<p/>'' Another silence followed. They did not speak for nearly a minute. So at least it seemed to Ivan. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) moved to get up.
<p/>Smerdyakov seemed to seize the moment. '' I'm in an awful position, Ivan Fyodorovitch. I don't know how to help myself,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) said resolutely and distinctly, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) last word he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) sighed.
<p/>Ivan Fyodorovitch sat down again. '' They are both utterly crazy, they are no better than little children,'' Smerdyakov went on.
<p/>'' I am speaking of your parent and your brother Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Here Fyodor Pavlovitch will get up directly and begin worrying me every minute, `Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) come?
<p/>And if Agrafena Alexandrovna doesn't come -LRB-for very likely she (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) does not mean to come at all-RRB- then he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) will be at me again to-morrow morning, `Why hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) come?
<p/>Why hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) come?' and so on up till midnight and even after midnight. When will she (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) come?'--as though I were to blame for it.
<p/>As soon as it gets dark, or even before, your brother will appear with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) gun in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hands: `Look out, you rogue, you soup-maker.
<p/>On the other side it's no better. If you miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) and don't let me know she (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'s been--I'll kill you before any one.'
<p/>When the night's over, in the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), too, like Fyodor Pavlovitch, begins worrying me to death. ' Why hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) come?
<p/>And every day and every hour they get angrier and angrier, so that I sometimes think I shall kill myself in a fright.
<p/>Will she (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) come soon?' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), too, thinks me to blame because his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) lady hasn't come. I can't depend upon them, sir.''
<p/>'' And why have you meddled? Why did you begin to spy for Dmitri Fyodorovitch?'' said Ivan irritably. '' How could I help meddling?
<p/>Though, indeed, I haven't meddled at all, if you want to know the truth of the matter. I kept quiet from the very beginning, not daring to answer; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) pitched on me to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) servant.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) has had only one thing to say since: `I'll kill you, you scoundrel, if you miss her (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>),' I feel certain, sir, that I shall have a long fit to- morrow.
<p/>'' '' What do you mean by 'a long fit'?'' <div class="bookquote">``A long fit, lasting a long time--several hours, or perhaps a day or two.
<p/>Once it went on for three days. I fell from the garret that time. The struggling ceased and then began again, and for three days I couldn't come back to my senses.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch sent for Herzenstube, the doctor here, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) put ice on my head and tried another remedy, too.... I might have died.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But they say one can't tell with epilepsy when a fit is coming. What makes you say you will have one to-morrow?
<p/>'' Ivan inquired, with a peculiar, irritable curiosity. '' That's just so. You can't tell beforehand.'' '' Besides, you fell from the garret then.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I climb up to the garret every day. I might fall from the garret again to-morrow. And, if not, I might fall down the cellar steps.
<p/>You are talking nonsense, I see, and I don't quite understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said softly, but with a sort of menace.
<p/>I have to go into the cellar every day, too. '' Ivan took a long look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). '' '' Do you mean to pretend to be ill to-morrow for three days, eh?
<p/>'' Smerdyakov, who was looking at the ground again, and playing with the toe of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) right foot, set the foot down, moved the left one forward, and, grinning, articulated: <div class="bookquote">``If I were able to play such a trick, that is, pretend to have a fit--and it would not be difficult for a man accustomed to them--I should have a perfect right to use such a means to save myself from death.
<p/>For even if Agrafena Alexandrovna comes to see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father while I am ill, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) honor can't blame a sick man for not telling him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d be ashamed to. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hang it all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan cried, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face working with anger, <div class="bookquote">``why are you always in such a funk for your life?
<p/>All my brother Dmitri's threats are only hasty words and mean nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) won't kill you; it's not you he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)'ll kill!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/>But even more than that, I am afraid I shall be taken for an accomplice of his (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) does something crazy to his (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) father.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>)'d kill me first of all, like a fly. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why should you be taken for an accomplice?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' They'll think I am an accomplice, because I let him (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) know the signals as a great secret.
<p/>I'm bound to admit the fact,'' Smerdyakov drawled with pedantic composure, <div class="bookquote">``that I have a secret with Fyodor Pavlovitch in this business.
<p/>As you know yourself -LRB-if only you do know it-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) has for several days past locked himself in as soon as night or even evening comes on.
<p/>Of late you've been going upstairs to your room early every evening, and yesterday you did not come down at all, and so perhaps you don't know how carefully he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) has begun to lock himself in at night, and even if Grigory Vassilyevitch comes to the door he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) won't open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) hears his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) voice.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What signals? Whom did you tell? Confound you, speak more plainly.''  (<font color='red'><b>Grigory/Grigory Vassilyevitch</b></font>)</div>'' But Grigory Vassilyevitch does not come, because I wait upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) room now.
<p/>But at night, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) orders, I go away to the lodge so that I don't get to sleep till midnight, but am on the watch, getting up and walking about the yard, waiting for Agrafena Alexandrovna to come.
<p/>That's the arrangement he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) made himself ever since this to-do with Agrafena Alexandrovna began. For the last few days he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>)'s been perfectly frantic expecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>).
<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) argues is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) is afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), Dmitri Fyodorovitch -LRB-Mitya, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) calls him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)-RRB-, `and so,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), `she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>)'ll come the back-way, late at night, to me.
<p/>You look out for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>),' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), 'till midnight and later; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) does come, you run up and knock at my door or at the window from the garden.
<p/>Knock at first twice, rather gently, and then three times more quickly, then,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), 'I shall understand at once that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) has come, and will open the door to you quietly.'
<p/>Another signal he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) gave me in case anything unexpected happens. At first, two knocks, and then, after an interval, another much louder.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) will understand that something has happened suddenly and that I must see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) will open to me so that I can go and speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>That's all in case Agrafena Alexandrovna can't come herself, but sends a message. Besides, Dmitri Fyodorovitch might come, too, so I must let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) know he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is near.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) honor is awfully afraid of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, so that even if Agrafena Alexandrovna had come and were locked in with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), and Dmitri Fyodorovitch were to turn up anywhere near at the time, I should be bound to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) know at once, knocking three times.
<p/>So that the first signal of five knocks means Agrafena Alexandrovna has come, while the second signal of three knocks means `something important to tell you.'
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) honor has shown me them several times and explained them. And as in the whole universe no one knows of these signals but
<p/>myself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) honor, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'d open the door without the slightest hesitation and without calling out -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is awfully afraid of calling out aloud-RRB-.
<p/>Well, those signals are known to Dmitri Fyodorovitch too, now. '' <div class="bookquote">``How are they known? Did you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)? How dared you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)?''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) yesterday on account of Grushenka, like the frantic, savage fool he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) is, but he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) won't steal.
<p/>'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) is in very great need of money now--the greatest need, Ivan Fyodorovitch. You don't know in what need he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is,'' Smerdyakov explained, with perfect composure and remarkable distinctness.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) looks on that three thousand as his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) own, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) said so to me himself. ' My father still owes me just three thousand,' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said.
<p/>It's as good as certain, so to say, that Agrafena Alexandrovna will force him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), if only she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) cares to, to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>)--the master himself, I mean, Fyodor Pavlovitch--if only she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) cares to, and of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) may care to.
<p/>And besides that, consider, Ivan Fyodorovitch, there is something else perfectly true. All I've said is that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) won't come, but maybe she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>)'s looking for more than that--
<p/>I know myself that Samsonov, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) merchant, was laughing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) about it, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) quite openly that it would not be at all a stupid thing to do.
<p/>So, taking that into consideration, Ivan Fyodorovitch, reflect that then neither Dmitri Fyodorovitch nor yourself and your brother, Alexey Fyodorovitch, would have anything after the master's death, not a rouble, for Agrafena Alexandrovna would marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) simply to get hold of the whole, all the money there is.
<p/>But if your father were to die now, there'd be some forty thousand for sure, even for Dmitri Fyodorovitch whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) hates so, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'s made no will....
<p/>I mean to be mistress here. And she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)'s got plenty of sense. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) wouldn't marry a beggar like Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Dmitri Fyodorovitch knows all that very well.
<p/>'' A sort of shudder passed over Ivan's face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) suddenly flushed. '' Then why on earth,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) suddenly interrupted Smerdyakov, <div class="bookquote">``do you advise me to go to Tchermashnya?
<p/>What did you mean by that? If I go away, you see what will happen here. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>Ivan drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) breath with difficulty.
<p/>'' Precisely so,'' said Smerdyakov, softly and reasonably, watching Ivan intently, however. '' What do you mean by `precisely so'? ''
<p/>Ivan questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), with a menacing light in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) eyes, restraining himself with difficulty. '' I spoke because I felt sorry for you.
<p/>If I were in your place I should simply throw it all up ... rather than stay on in such a position,'' answered Smerdyakov, with the most candid air looking at Ivan's flashing eyes.
<p/>They were both silent. '' You seem to be a perfect idiot, and what's more ... an awful scoundrel, too. ''
<p/>Ivan rose suddenly from the bench. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was about to pass straight through the gate, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) stopped short and turned to Smerdyakov.
<p/>Ivan, in a sudden paroxysm, bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) lip, clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) fists, and, in another minute, would have flung himself on Smerdyakov.
<p/>But the moment passed without mischief to Smerdyakov, and Ivan turned in silence, as it seemed in perplexity, to the gate.
<p/>Something strange followed. The latter, anyway, noticed it at the same moment, started, and shrank back. '' I am going away to Moscow to-morrow, if you care to know--early to-morrow morning.
<p/>That's all! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) suddenly said aloud angrily, and wondered himself afterwards what need there was to say this then to Smerdyakov.
<p/>That's the best thing you can do,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) responded, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had expected to hear it; <div class="bookquote">``except that you can always be telegraphed for from Moscow, if anything should happen here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Ivan stopped again, and again turned quickly to Smerdyakov. But a change had passed over him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), too. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) familiarity and carelessness had completely disappeared.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face expressed attention and expectation, intent but timid and cringing. '' Haven't you something more to say--something to add?'' could be read in the intent gaze he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) fixed on Ivan.
<p/>'' And couldn't I be sent for from Tchermashnya, too--in case anything happened? '' Ivan shouted suddenly, for some unknown reason raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``From Tchermashnya, too ... you could be sent for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>Smerdyakov muttered, almost in a whisper, looking disconcerted, but gazing intently into Ivan's eyes.
<p/>Is it to save my spending money on the fare, or to save my going so far out of my way, that you insist on Tchermashnya?''
<p/>'' Only Moscow is farther and Tchermashnya is nearer. <div class="bookquote">``Precisely so ... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>muttered Smerdyakov, with a breaking voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) looked at Ivan with a revolting smile, and again made ready to draw back.
<p/>Any one who had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face at that moment would have known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was not laughing from lightness of heart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) could not have explained himself what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was feeling at that instant.
<p/>But to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) astonishment Ivan broke into a laugh, and went through the gate still laughing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) moved and walked as though in a nervous frenzy.
<p/>Chapter VII. '' It's Always Worth While Speaking To A Clever Man '' And in the same nervous frenzy, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) spoke.
<p/>Meeting Fyodor Pavlovitch in the drawing-room directly he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) went in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) shouted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>), waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) hands, <div class="bookquote">``I am going upstairs to my room, not in to you.
<p/>Very possibly the old man was too hateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at that moment; but such an unceremonious display of hostility was a surprise even to Fyodor Pavlovitch.
<p/>And the old man evidently wanted to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) something at once and had come to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the drawing-room on purpose.
<p/>Receiving this amiable greeting, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood still in silence and with an ironical air watched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son going upstairs, till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed out of sight.
<p/>Good-by!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and passed by, trying not even to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father. '' What's the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) promptly asked Smerdyakov, who had followed Ivan.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Angry about something. Who can tell? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the valet muttered evasively. <div class="bookquote">``Confound him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)! Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) be angry then. Bring in the samovar, and get along with you.
<p/>Then followed a series of questions such as Smerdyakov had just complained of to Ivan, all relating to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) expected visitor, and these questions we will omit.
<p/>Half an hour later the house was locked, and the crazy old man was wandering along through the rooms in excited expectation of hearing every minute the five knocks agreed upon.
<p/>Look sharp! No news? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) peered out into the darkness, seeing nothing. It was very late, but Ivan was still awake and reflecting.
<p/>But we will not give an account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) thoughts, and this is not the place to look into that soul--its turn will come.
<p/>And even if one tried, it would be very hard to give an account of them, for there were no thoughts in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brain, but something very vague, and, above all, intense excitement.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was fretted, too, by all sorts of strange and almost surprising desires; for instance, after midnight he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) suddenly had an intense irresistible inclination to go down, open the door, go to the lodge and beat Smerdyakov.
<p/>But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had been asked why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) could not have given any exact reason, except perhaps that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) loathed the valet as one who had insulted him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) more gravely than any one in the world.
<p/>On the other hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was more than once that night overcome by a sort of inexplicable humiliating terror, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) felt positively paralyzed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) physical powers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) sat up late that night, till two o'clock. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) felt himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) bearings. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) head ached and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was giddy.
<p/>A feeling of hatred was rankling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) heart, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) meant to avenge himself on some one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) even hated Alyosha, recalling the conversation he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had just had with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>Of Katerina Ivanovna he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) almost forgot to think, and wondered greatly at this afterwards, especially as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) remembered perfectly that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had protested so valiantly to Katerina Ivanovna that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) would go away next day to Moscow, something had whispered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) heart, <div class="bookquote">``That's nonsense, you are not going, and it won't be so easy to tear yourself away as you are boasting now.
<p/>Remembering that night long afterwards, Ivan recalled with peculiar repulsion how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had suddenly got up from the sofa and had stealthily, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) were afraid of being watched, opened the door, gone out on the staircase and listened to Fyodor Pavlovitch stirring down below, had listened a long while--some five minutes--with a sort of strange curiosity, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) breath while his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) heart throbbed.
<p/>At moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) hated himself intensely. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And why he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had done all this, why he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was listening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) could not have said.
<p/>That <div class="bookquote">``action''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>all his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) life afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) called <div class="bookquote">``infamous,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) thought of it as the basest action of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) life.
<p/>For Fyodor Pavlovitch himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) felt no hatred at that moment, but was simply intensely curious to know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was walking down there below and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) must be doing now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) wondered and imagined how he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) must be peeping out of the dark windows and stopping in the middle of the room, listening, listening--for some one to knock.
<p/>About two o'clock when everything was quiet, and even Fyodor Pavlovitch had gone to bed, Ivan had got into bed, firmly resolved to fall asleep at once, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) felt fearfully exhausted.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) did fall asleep at once, and slept soundly without dreams, but waked early, at seven o'clock, when it was broad daylight.
<p/>Ivan went out on to the stairs twice to listen like this. Opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was surprised to feel himself extraordinarily vigorous.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) jumped up at once and dressed quickly; then dragged out his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) trunk and began packing immediately. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) linen had come back from the laundress the previous morning.
<p/>Though Ivan had said the day before -LRB-to Katerina Ivanovna, Alyosha, and Smerdyakov-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was leaving next day, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had no thought of departure when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) went to bed, or, at least, had not dreamed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) first act in the morning would be to pack his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) trunk.
<p/>Ivan positively smiled at the thought that everything was helping his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) sudden departure. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) departure certainly was sudden. At last his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) trunk and bag were ready.
<p/>It was about nine o'clock when Marfa Ignatyevna came in with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) usual inquiry, <div class="bookquote">``Where will your honor take your tea, in your own room or downstairs?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marfa Ignatyevna</b></font>)</div><p/>Greeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father affably, and even inquiring specially after his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) health, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) did not wait to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) answer to the end, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) announced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was starting off in an hour to return to Moscow for good, and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) to send for the horses.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father heard this announcement with no sign of surprise, and forgot in an unmannerly way to show regret at losing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) looked almost cheerful, but there was about him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), about his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) words and gestures, something hurried and scattered. Instead of doing so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) flew into a great flutter at the recollection of some important business of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) own.
<p/>'' What a fellow you are! Not to tell me yesterday! Never mind; we'll manage it all the same. Do me a great service, my dear boy.
<p/>It's only to turn to the left from the station at Volovya, only another twelve versts and you come to Tchermashnya.
<p/>Go to Tchermashnya on the way. '' '' I'm sorry, I can't. It's eighty versts to the railway and the train starts for Moscow at seven o'clock to-night.
<p/>I can only just catch it.'' <div class="bookquote">``You'll catch it to-morrow or the day after, but to-day turn off to Tchermashnya. It won't put you out much to humor your father!
<p/>If I hadn't had something to keep me here, I would have run over myself long ago, for I've some business there in a hurry.
<p/>But here I ... it's not the time for me to go now.... You see, I've two pieces of copse land there.
<p/>The Maslovs, an old merchant and his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) son, will give eight thousand for the timber. But last year I just missed a purchaser who would have given twelve.
<p/>There's no getting any one about here to buy it. The Maslovs have it all their own way. One has to take what they'll give, for no one here dare bid against them.
<p/>The priest at Ilyinskoe wrote to me last Thursday that a merchant called Gorstkin, a man I know, had turned up.
<p/>What makes him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) valuable is that he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) is not from these parts, so he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) is not afraid of the Maslovs. He (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) will give me eleven thousand for the copse.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>)'ll only be here, the priest writes, for a week altogether, so you must go at once and make a bargain with him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Do you hear? '' Well, you write to the priest; he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)'ll make the bargain.'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) can't do it. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) has no eye for business.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is a perfect treasure, I'd give him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) twenty thousand to take care of for me without a receipt; but he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) has no eye for business, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is a perfect child, a crow could deceive him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>).
<p/>And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) is a learned man, would you believe it? This Gorstkin looks like a peasant, he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) wears a blue kaftan, but he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) is a regular rogue.
<p/>That's the common complaint. He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) is a liar. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) tells such lies that you wonder why he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) is doing it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) told me the year before last that his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) wife was dead and that he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) had married another, and would you believe it, there was not a word of truth in it?
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) wife has never died at all, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is alive to this day and gives him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) a beating twice a week.
<p/>So what you have to find out is whether he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) is lying or speaking the truth, when he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) wants to buy it and would give eleven thousand.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall be no use in such a business. I have no eye either.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stay, wait a bit! You will be of use, for I will tell you the signs by which you can judge about Gorstkin.
<p/>I've done business with him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) a long time. You see, you must watch his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) beard; he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) has a nasty, thin, red beard.
<p/>If his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) beard shakes when he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) talks and he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) gets cross, it's all right, he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) is saying what he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) means, he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) wants to do business.
<p/>Don't watch his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) eyes, you won't find out anything from his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) is a deep one, a rogue--but watch his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) beard!
<p/>But if he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) strokes his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) beard with his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) left hand and grins--he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) is trying to cheat you. I'll give you a note and you show it to him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>)'s called Gorstkin, though his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) real name is Lyagavy-LRB-4-RRB-; but don't call him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) so, he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) will be offended. If you come to an understanding with him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>), and see it's all right, write here at once.
<p/>You need only write: `He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>)'s not lying.' Stand out for eleven thousand; one thousand you can knock off, but not more.
<p/>It's as good as picking up three thousand; it's not so easy to find a purchaser, and I'm in desperate need of money.
<p/>Just think! there's a difference between eight thousand and eleven thousand. Only let me know it's serious, and I'll run over and fix it up.
<p/>I'll snatch the time somehow. But what's the good of my galloping over, if it's all a notion of the priest's?
<p/>Come, will you go?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, I can't spare the time. You must excuse me.'' <div class="bookquote">``Come, you might oblige your father.
<p/>I shan't forget it. You've no heart, any of you--that's what it is? What's a day or two to you? Where are you going now--to Venice?

<p/>I send you just because you are a clever fellow. Do you suppose I don't see that? You know nothing about timber, but you've got an eye.
<p/>All that is wanted is to see whether the man is in earnest. I tell you, watch his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beard--if his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beard shakes you know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is in earnest.''

<p/>You can go to Venice. The priest will give you horses back to Volovya station. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The old man was quite delighted.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote the note, and sent for the horses. A light lunch was brought in, with brandy. When Fyodor Pavlovitch was pleased, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) usually became expansive, but to-day he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) seemed to restrain himself.
<p/>Of Dmitri, for instance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) did not say a word. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was quite unmoved by the parting, and seemed, in fact, at a loss for something to say.
<p/>Ivan noticed this particularly. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) must be bored with me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) thought. Only when accompanying his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) son out on to the steps, the old man began to fuss about.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but Ivan made haste to hold out his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hand, obviously avoiding the kiss. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father saw it at once, and instantly pulled himself up.
<p/>'' Well, good luck to you, good luck to you! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) repeated from the steps. '' You'll come again some time or other?
<p/>Mind you do come. I shall always be glad to see you. Well, Christ be with you!'' Ivan got into the carriage.
<p/>'' Good-by, Ivan! Don't be too hard on me! '' the father called for the last time. The whole household came out to take leave--Smerdyakov, Marfa and Grigory.
<p/>Ivan gave them ten roubles each. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had seated himself in the carriage, Smerdyakov jumped up to arrange the rug.
<p/>'' You see ... I am going to Tchermashnya,'' broke suddenly from Ivan. Again, as the day before, the words seemed to drop of themselves, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) laughed, too, a peculiar, nervous laugh.
<p/>It's a true saying then, that `it's always worth while speaking to a clever man,' '' answered Smerdyakov firmly, looking significantly at Ivan.
<p/>Nothing was clear in Ivan's soul, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) looked eagerly around him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) at the fields, at the hills, at the trees, at a flock of geese flying high overhead in the bright sky.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) tried to talk to the driver, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) felt intensely interested in an answer the peasant made him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>); but a minute later he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) realized that he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was not catching anything, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) had not really even taken in the peasant's answer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) remembered it long after. '' The carriage rolled away. And all of a sudden he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) felt very happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was silent, and it was pleasant even so.
<p/>The air was fresh, pure and cool, the sky bright. The images of Alyosha and Katerina Ivanovna floated into his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) mind.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) softly smiled, blew softly on the friendly phantoms, and they flew away. '' There's plenty of time for them,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) thought.
<p/>They reached the station quickly, changed horses, and galloped to Volovya. '' Why is it worth while speaking to a clever man?
<p/>What did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mean by that? '' The thought seemed suddenly to clutch at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breathing. '' And why did I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) I was going to Tchermashnya?''
<p/>Ivan got out of the carriage, and the drivers stood round him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) bargaining over the journey of twelve versts to Tchermashnya.
<p/>They reached Volovya station. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) told them to harness the horses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) went into the station house, looked round, glanced at the overseer's wife, and suddenly went back to the entrance.
<p/>'' I won't go to Tchermashnya. Am I too late to reach the railway by seven, brothers?'' <div class="bookquote">``We shall just do it.
<p/>Shall we get the carriage out?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``At once. Will any one of you be going to the town to-morrow?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' To be sure.
<p/>Mitri here will. '' <div class="bookquote">``Can you do me a service, Mitri? Go to my father's, to Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) I haven't gone to Tchermashnya.
<p/>Can you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course I can. I've known Fyodor Pavlovitch a long time.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' And here's something for you, for I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) won't give you anything,'' said Ivan, laughing gayly.
<p/>'' You may depend on it he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) won't. '' Mitya laughed too. '' Thank you, sir. I'll be sure to do it.
<p/>'' At seven o'clock Ivan got into the train and set off to Moscow <div class="bookquote">``Away with the past. I've done with the old world for ever, and may I have no news, no echo, from it.
<p/>But instead of delight his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) soul was filled with such gloom, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) heart ached with such anguish, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had never known in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) life before.
<p/>To a new life, new places and no looking back!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was thinking all the night. The train flew on, and only at daybreak, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was approaching Moscow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) suddenly roused himself from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) meditation.
<p/>'' I am a scoundrel,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) whispered to himself. Fyodor Pavlovitch remained well satisfied at having seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) son off. For two hours afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) felt almost happy, and sat drinking brandy.
<p/>But suddenly something happened which was very annoying and unpleasant for every one in the house, and completely upset Fyodor Pavlovitch's equanimity at once.
<p/>Smerdyakov went to the cellar for something and fell down from the top of the steps. Fortunately, Marfa Ignatyevna was in the yard and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) in time.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) did not see the fall, but heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) scream--the strange, peculiar scream, long familiar to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>)--the scream of the epileptic falling in a fit.
<p/>They could not tell whether the fit had come on him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) at the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was descending the steps, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) must have fallen unconscious, or whether it was the fall and the shock that had caused the fit in Smerdyakov, who was known to be liable to them.
<p/>It was thought at first that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) must have broken something--an arm or a leg--and hurt himself, but <div class="bookquote">``God had preserved him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as Marfa Ignatyevna expressed it--nothing of the kind had happened.
<p/>They found him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) at the bottom of the cellar steps, writhing in convulsions and foaming at the mouth. But it was difficult to get him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) out of the cellar.
<p/>They asked the neighbors to help and managed it somehow. Fyodor Pavlovitch himself was present at the whole ceremony. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) helped, evidently alarmed and upset.
<p/>The sick man did not regain consciousness; the convulsions ceased for a time, but then began again, and every one concluded that the same thing would happen, as had happened a year before, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) accidentally fell from the garret.
<p/>They remembered that ice had been put on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head then. There was still ice in the cellar, and Marfa Ignatyevna had some brought up.
<p/>In the evening, Fyodor Pavlovitch sent for Doctor Herzenstube, who arrived at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was a most estimable old man, and the most careful and conscientious doctor in the province.
<p/>After careful examination, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) concluded that the fit was a very violent one and might have serious consequences; that meanwhile he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), Herzenstube, did not fully understand it, but that by to-morrow morning, if the present remedies were unavailing, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would venture to try something else.
<p/>The invalid was taken to the lodge, to a room next to Grigory's and Marfa Ignatyevna's. Then Fyodor Pavlovitch had one misfortune after another to put up with that day.
<p/>Marfa Ignatyevna cooked the dinner, and the soup, compared with Smerdyakov's, was <div class="bookquote">``no better than dish-water,''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>and the fowl was so dried up that it was impossible to masticate it.
<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) master's bitter, though deserved, reproaches, Marfa Ignatyevna replied that the fowl was a very old one to begin with, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had never been trained as a cook.
<p/>In the evening there was another trouble in store for Fyodor Pavlovitch; he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was informed that Grigory, who had not been well for the last three days, was completely laid up by his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) lumbago.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) tea as early as possible and locked himself up alone in the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was in terrible excitement and suspense.
<p/>That evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) reckoned on Grushenka's coming almost as a certainty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had received from Smerdyakov that morning an assurance <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had promised to come without fail.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>The incorrigible old man's heart throbbed with excitement; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paced up and down his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) empty rooms listening. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to be on the alert.
<p/>Dmitri might be on the watch for her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) somewhere, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) knocked on the window -LRB-Smerdyakov had informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) two days before that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) where and how to knock-RRB- the door must be opened at once.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) must not be a second in the passage, for fear--which God forbid!--that she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) should be frightened and run away. Fyodor Pavlovitch had much to think of, but never had his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) heart been steeped in such voluptuous hopes.
<p/>This time he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) could say almost certainly that she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would come! Book VI. The Russian Monk Chapter I. Father Zossima And His (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) Visitors
<p/>Instead of a sick man at his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) last gasp, perhaps unconscious, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had feared to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) sitting up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) chair and, though weak and exhausted, his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) face was bright and cheerful, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was surrounded by visitors and engaged in a quiet and joyful conversation.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had only got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) bed a quarter of an hour before Alyosha's arrival; his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) visitors had gathered together in his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) cell earlier, waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) to wake, having received a most confident assurance from Father Paďssy that <div class="bookquote">``the teacher would get up, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) had himself promised in the morning, converse once more with those dear to his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) heart.
<p/>When with an anxious and aching heart Alyosha went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) elder's cell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) stood still almost astonished. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Paďssy/Father Paďssy</b></font>)</div>This promise and indeed every word of the dying elder Father Paďssy put implicit trust in.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) unconscious, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) breathe his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) last, and yet had his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) promise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) would rise up and say good-by to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) would not have believed perhaps even in death, but would still have expected the dead man to recover and fulfill his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) promise.
<p/>In the morning as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay down to sleep, Father Zossima had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) positively: <div class="bookquote">``I shall not die without the delight of another conversation with you, beloved of my heart.
<p/>The monks, who had gathered for this probably last conversation with Father Zossima, had all been his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) devoted friends for many years.
<p/>There were four of them: Father Iosif and Father Paďssy, Father Mihaďl, the warden of the hermitage, a man not very old and far from being learned.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was of humble origin, of strong will and steadfast faith, of austere appearance, but of deep tenderness, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) obviously concealed it as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) were almost ashamed of it.
<p/>I shall look once more on your dear face and pour out my heart to you once again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The fourth, Father Anfim, was a very old and humble little monk of the poorest peasant class.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was the humblest of the humble, and looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) had been frightened by something great and awful beyond the scope of his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) intelligence.
<p/>Father Zossima had a great affection for this timorous man, and always treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) with marked respect, though perhaps there was no one he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had known to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had said less, in spite of the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had spent years wandering about holy Russia with him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).
<p/>That was very long ago, forty years before, when Father Zossima first began his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) life as a monk in a poor and little monastery at Kostroma, and when, shortly after, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had accompanied Father Anfim on his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) pilgrimage to collect alms for their poor monastery.
<p/>The whole party were in the bedroom which, as we mentioned before, was very small, so that there was scarcely room for the four of them -LRB-in addition to Porfiry, the novice, who stood-RRB- to sit round Father Zossima on chairs brought from the sitting-room.
<p/>It was already beginning to get dark, the room was lighted up by the lamps and the candles before the ikons.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was almost illiterate, and very quiet, scarcely speaking to any one. Seeing Alyosha standing embarrassed in the doorway, Father Zossima smiled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) joyfully and held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hand.
<p/>'' Welcome, my quiet one, welcome, my dear, here you are too. I knew you would come. '' Alyosha went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), bowed down before him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) to the ground and wept.
<p/>Something surged up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) heart, his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) soul was quivering, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) wanted to sob. '' Come, don't weep over me yet,'' Father Zossima smiled, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) right hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) head.
<p/>You see I am sitting up talking; maybe I shall live another twenty years yet, as that dear good woman from Vishegorye, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) little Lizaveta in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms, wished me yesterday.
<p/>'' God bless the mother and the little girl Lizaveta,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) crossed himself. '' Porfiry, did you take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) offering where I told you?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) meant the sixty copecks brought him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) the day before by the good-humored woman to be given <div class="bookquote">``to some one poorer than me.
<p/>The elder had sent Porfiry the evening before to a widow, whose house had been burnt down lately, and who after the fire had gone with her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) children begging alms.

Porfiry hastened to reply that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had given the money, as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been instructed, <div class="bookquote">``from an unknown benefactress.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get up, my dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>the elder went on to Alyosha. <div class="bookquote">``Let me look at you. Have you been home and seen your brother?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>It seemed strange to Alyosha that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) asked so confidently and precisely, about one of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) brothers only--but which one?
<p/>Then perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) out both yesterday and to-day for the sake of that brother. '' I have seen one of my brothers,'' answered Alyosha.
<p/>'' I mean the elder one, to whom I bowed down.'' <div class="bookquote">``I only saw him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) yesterday and could not find him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha.

<p/>The words were strange. Father Iosif, who had witnessed the scene yesterday, exchanged glances with Father Paďssy. Alyosha could not resist asking: <div class="bookquote">``Father and teacher,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) began with extreme emotion, <div class="bookquote">``your words are too obscure....
<p/>What is this suffering in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't inquire. I seemed to see something terrible yesterday ... as though his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) whole future were expressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Once or twice in my life I've seen such a look in a man's face ... reflecting as it were his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) future fate, and that fate, alas, came to pass.
<p/>A look came into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes--so that I was instantly horror-stricken at what that man is preparing for himself. I sent you to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Alexey, for I thought your brotherly face would help him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>).
<p/>Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.'
<p/>But everything and all our fates are from the Lord. ' Remember that. You, Alexey, I've many times silently blessed for your face, know that,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>added the elder with a gentle smile.
<p/>This is what I think of you, you will go forth from these walls, but will live like a monk in the world.
<p/>Life will bring you many misfortunes, but you will find your happiness in them, and will bless life and will make others bless it--which is what matters most.
<p/>Fathers and teachers,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) addressed his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) friends with a tender smile, <div class="bookquote">``I have never till to-day told even him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) why the face of this youth is so dear to me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>You will have many enemies, but even your foes will love you. Well, that is your character. Now I will tell you.
<p/>At the dawn of my life when I was a child I had an elder brother who died before my eyes at seventeen.
<p/>And later on in the course of my life I gradually became convinced that that brother had been for a guidance and a sign from on high for me.
<p/>For had he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) not come into my life, I should never perhaps, so I fancy at least, have become a monk and entered on this precious path.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) appeared first to me in my childhood, and here, at the end of my pilgrimage, he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) seems to have come to me over again.
<p/>It is marvelous, fathers and teachers, that Alexey, who has some, though not a great, resemblance in face, seems to me so like him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) spiritually, that many times I have taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) for that young man, my brother, mysteriously come back to me at the end of my pilgrimage, as a reminder and an inspiration.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) face has been as it were a remembrance and a prophecy for me. So that I positively wondered at so strange a dream in myself.
<p/>Many times I've seen in your face as it were a look of mortification that I love Alexey more than you.
<p/>Now you know why that was so, but I love you too, know that, and many times I grieved at your mortification.
<p/>I should like to tell you, dear friends, of that youth, my brother, for there has been no presence in my life more precious, more significant and touching.
<p/>My heart is full of tenderness, and I look at my whole life at this moment as though living through it again.
<p/>Here I must observe that this last conversation of Father Zossima with the friends who visited him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) on the last day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) life has been partly preserved in writing.
<p/>Do you hear this, Porfiry? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) turned to the novice who waited on him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>). '' '' ------------------------------------- Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov wrote it down from memory, some time after his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) elder's death.
<p/>But whether this was only the conversation that took place then, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) added to it his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) notes of parts of former conversations with his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) teacher, I cannot determine.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) account, Father Zossima's talk goes on without interruption, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) life to his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) friends in the form of a story, though there is no doubt, from other accounts of it, that the conversation that evening was general.
<p/>Besides, Father Zossima could not have carried on an uninterrupted narrative, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) was sometimes gasping for breath, his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) voice failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) even lay down to rest on his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) bed, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) did not fall asleep and his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) visitors did not leave their seats.
<p/>Though the guests did not interrupt Father Zossima much, yet they too talked, perhaps even told something themselves. Once or twice the conversation was interrupted by Father Paďssy's reading the Gospel.
<p/>It is worthy of note, too, that no one of them supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) would die that night, for on that evening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) life after his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) deep sleep in the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) seemed suddenly to have found new strength, which kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) up through this long conversation.
<p/>It was like a last effort of love which gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) marvelous energy; only for a little time, however, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) life was cut short immediately....
<p/>But of that later. I will only add now that I have preferred to confine myself to the account given by Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov.
<p/>It will be shorter and not so fatiguing, though of course, as I must repeat, Alyosha took a great deal from previous conversations and added them to it.

<p/>Father Zossima's Brother Beloved fathers and teachers, I was born in a distant province in the north, in the town of V.
<p/>------------------------------------- BIOGRAPHICAL NOTES -LRB-a-RRB- My father was a gentleman by birth, but of no great consequence or position. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) died when I was only two years old, and I don't remember him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at all.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) left my mother a small house built of wood, and a fortune, not large, but sufficient to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children in comfort.
<p/>There were two of us, my elder brother Markel and I. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markel</b></font>) was eight years older than I was, of hasty irritable temperament, but kind-hearted and never ironical.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Markel</b></font>) did well at school, but did not get on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Markel</b></font>) schoolfellows, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Markel</b></font>) never quarreled, at least so my mother has told me.
<p/>Six months before his (<font color='blue'><b>Markel</b></font>) death, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Markel</b></font>) was seventeen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Markel</b></font>) made friends with a political exile who had been banished from Moscow to our town for freethinking, and led a solitary existence there.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Markel</b></font>) was remarkably silent, especially at home with me, his (<font color='blue'><b>Markel</b></font>) mother, and the servants. He (<font color='blue'><b>Markel</b></font>) was a good scholar who had gained distinction in philosophy in the university.
<p/>The young man would spend whole evenings with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) during that winter, till the exile was summoned to Petersburg to take up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) post again at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own request, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had powerful friends.
<p/>Something made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) take a fancy to Markel, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Markel</b></font>) used to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Markel</b></font>) to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Markel</b></font>). It was the beginning of Lent, and Markel would not fast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Markel</b></font>) was rude and laughed at it.
<p/>'' That's all silly twaddle, and there is no God,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, horrifying my mother, the servants, and me too. For though I was only nine, I too was aghast at hearing such words.
<p/>I remember my mother selling one of the four, the cook Afimya, who was lame and elderly, for sixty paper roubles, and hiring a free servant to take her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) place.
<p/>In the sixth week in Lent, my brother, who was never strong and had a tendency to consumption, was taken ill.
<p/>I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) caught cold, anyway the doctor, who came, soon whispered to my mother that it was galloping consumption, that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would not live through the spring.
<p/>My mother began weeping, and, careful not to alarm my brother, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to go to church, to confess and take the sacrament, as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was still able to move about.
<p/>We had four servants, all serfs. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was tall but thin and delicate- looking, and of very pleasing countenance. This made him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) angry, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said something profane about the church.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) grew thoughtful, however; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) guessed at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was seriously ill, and that that was why his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mother was begging him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to confess and take the sacrament.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had been aware, indeed, for a long time past, that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was far from well, and had a year before coolly observed at dinner to our mother and me,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My life won't be long among you, I may not live another year,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>which seemed now like a prophecy. Three days passed and Holy Week had come.
<p/>And on Tuesday morning my brother began going to church. '' I am doing this simply for your sake, mother, to please and comfort you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said.
<p/>My mother wept with joy and grief. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) end must be near,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``if there's such a change in him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was not able to go to church long, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) took to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) bed, so he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had to confess and take the sacrament at home.
<p/>I remember he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) used to cough all night and sleep badly, but in the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) dressed and tried to sit up in an arm-chair.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was a late Easter, and the days were bright, fine, and full of fragrance. That's how I remember him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sitting, sweet and gentle, smiling, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) face bright and joyous, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) illness.
<p/>A marvelous change passed over him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) spirit seemed transformed. The old nurse would come in and say, <div class="bookquote">``Let me light the lamp before the holy image, my dear.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The nurse</b></font>)</div>And once he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would not have allowed it and would have blown it out. '' Light it, light it, dear, I was a wretch to have prevented you doing it.
<p/>You are praying when you light the lamp, and I am praying when I rejoice seeing you. So we are praying to the same God.
<p/>Those words seemed strange to us, and mother would go to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) room and weep, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went in to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes and looked cheerful.
<p/>Mother, don't weep, darling,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``I've long to live yet, long to rejoice with you, and life is glad and joyful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>``Ah, dear boy, how can you talk of joy when you lie feverish at night, coughing as though you would tear yourself to pieces.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't cry, mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would answer, <div class="bookquote">``life is paradise, and we are all in paradise, but we won't see it, if we would, we should have heaven on earth the next day.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' Every one wondered at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) words, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spoke so strangely and positively; we were all touched and wept.
<p/>Friends came to see us. '' Dear ones,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would say to them, <div class="bookquote">``what have I done that you should love me so
<p/>, how can you love any one like me, and how was it I did not know, I did not appreciate it before?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When the servants came in to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would say continually, <div class="bookquote">``Dear, kind people, why are you doing so much for me, do I deserve to be waited on?
<p/>If it were God's will for me to live, I would wait on you, for all men should wait on one another.
<p/>Mother, darling,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``there must be servants and masters, but if so I will be the servant of my servants, the same as they are to me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mother shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) head as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) listened. '' My darling, it's your illness makes you talk like that.'' '' And another thing, mother, every one of us has sinned against all men, and
<p/>I more than any. '' Mother positively smiled at that, smiled through her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) tears. '' Why, how could you have sinned against all men, more than all?
<p/>Robbers and murderers have done that, but what sin have you committed yet, that you hold yourself more guilty than all?''
<p/>Mother, little heart of mine,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) said -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) had begun using such strange caressing words at that time-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``little heart of mine, my joy, believe me, every one is really responsible to all men for all men and for everything.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I don't know how to explain it to you, but I feel it is so, painfully even. And how is it we went on then living, getting angry and not knowing?
<p/>'' So he (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) would get up every day, more and more sweet and joyous and full of love. When the doctor, an old German called Eisenschmidt, came: <div class="bookquote">``Well, doctor, have I another day in this world?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would ask, joking. '' You'll live many days yet,'' the doctor would answer, <div class="bookquote">``and months and years too. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Months and years!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would exclaim. '' Why reckon the days? One day is enough for a man to know all happiness. My dear ones, why do we quarrel, try to outshine each other and keep grudges against each other?
<p/>Let's go straight into the garden, walk and play there, love, appreciate, and kiss each other, and glorify life.'' '' Your son cannot last long,'' the doctor told my mother, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to the door.
<p/>The windows of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) room looked out into the garden, and our garden was a shady one, with old trees in it which were coming into bud.
<p/>'' The disease is affecting his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) brain. '' The first birds of spring were flitting in the branches, chirruping and singing at the windows.
<p/>And looking at them and admiring them, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) began suddenly begging their forgiveness too: <div class="bookquote">``Birds of heaven, happy birds, forgive me, for I have sinned against you too.
<p/>Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``there was such a glory of God all about me: birds, trees, meadows, sky; only I lived in shame and dishonored it all and did not notice the beauty and glory.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>None of us could understand that at the time, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shed tears of joy. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``You take too many sins on yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>mother used to say, weeping.
<p/>Though I can't explain it to you, I like to humble myself before them, for I don't know how to love them enough.
<p/>'' Mother, darling, it's for joy, not for grief I am crying. If I have sinned against every one, yet all forgive me, too, and that's heaven.
<p/>Am I not in heaven now? '' And there was a great deal more I don't remember. I remember I went once into his (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) room when there was no one else there.
<p/>It was a bright evening, the sun was setting, and the whole room was lighted up. He (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) beckoned me, and I went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) hands on my shoulders and looked into my face tenderly, lovingly; he (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) said nothing for a minute, only looked at me like that.
<p/>'' Well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``run and play now, enjoy life for me too. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I went out then and ran to play.
<p/>And many times in my life afterwards I remembered even with tears how he (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) told me to enjoy life for him (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) too.
<p/>There were many other marvelous and beautiful sayings of his (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>), though we did not understand them at the time. He (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) died the third week after Easter.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) was fully conscious though he (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) could not talk; up to his (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) last hour he (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) did not change. He (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) looked happy, his (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) eyes beamed and sought us, he (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) smiled at us, beckoned us.
<p/>I was impressed by all this at the time, but not too much so, though I cried a good deal at his (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) funeral.
<p/>I was young then, a child, but a lasting impression, a hidden feeling of it all, remained in my heart, ready to rise up and respond when the time came.
<p/>There was a great deal of talk even in the town about his (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) death. So indeed it happened. -LRB-b-RRB- Of the Holy Scriptures in the Life of Father Zossima
<p/>I was left alone with my mother. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) friends began advising her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to send me to Petersburg as other parents did.
<p/>You have only one son now,'' they said, <div class="bookquote">``and have a fair income, and you will be depriving him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) perhaps of a brilliant career if you keep him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) here.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>'' They suggested I should be sent to Petersburg to the Cadet Corps, that I might afterwards enter the Imperial Guard.
<p/>My mother hesitated for a long time, it was awful to part with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) only child, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mind to it at last, though not without many tears, believing she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was acting for my happiness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brought me to Petersburg and put me into the Cadet Corps, and I never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) again. For she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) too died three years afterwards.
<p/>From the house of my childhood I have brought nothing but precious memories, for there are no memories more precious than those of early childhood in one's first home.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spent those three years mourning and grieving for both of us. And that is almost always so if there is any love and harmony in the family at all.
<p/>Indeed, precious memories may remain even of a bad home, if only the heart knows how to find what is precious.
<p/>With my memories of home I count, too, my memories of the Bible, which, child as I was, I was very eager to read at home.
<p/>I had a book of Scripture history then with excellent pictures, called A Hundred and Four Stories from the Old and New Testament , and I learned to read from it.
<p/>I have it lying on my shelf now, I keep it as a precious relic of the past. But even before I learned to read, I remember first being moved to devotional feeling at eight years old.
<p/>My mother took me alone to mass -LRB-I don't remember where my brother was at the time-RRB- on the Monday before Easter.
<p/>It was a fine day, and I remember to-day, as though I saw it now, how the incense rose from the censer and softly floated upwards and, overhead in the cupola, mingled in rising waves with the sunlight that streamed in at the little window.
<p/>I was stirred by the sight, and for the first time in my life I consciously received the seed of God's word in my heart.
<p/>A youth came out into the middle of the church carrying a big book, so large that at the time I fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could scarcely carry it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) laid it on the reading desk, opened it, and began reading, and suddenly for the first time I understood something read in the church of God.
<p/>In the land of Uz, there lived a man, righteous and God-fearing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had great wealth, so many camels, so many sheep and asses, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) children feasted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved them very much and prayed for them.
<p/>Now the devil came before the Lord together with the sons of God, and said to the Lord that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had gone up and down the earth and under the earth.
<p/>'' It may be that my sons have sinned in their feasting. '' '' And hast thou considered my servant Job?
<p/>'' God asked of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). And God boasted to the devil, pointing to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) great and holy servant. And the devil laughed at God's words.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) over to me and Thou wilt see that Thy servant will murmur against Thee and curse Thy name. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>the devil</b></font>)</div><p/>And the devil smote his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) children and his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) cattle and scattered his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) wealth, all of a sudden like a thunderbolt from heaven.
<p/>And God gave up the just man He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) loved so, to the devil. And Job rent his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) mantle and fell down upon the ground and cried aloud,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return into the earth; the Lord gave and the Lord has taken away.
<p/>Fathers and teachers, forgive my tears now, for all my childhood rises up again before me, and I breathe now as I breathed then, with the breast of a little child of eight, and I feel as I did then, awe and wonder and gladness.
<p/>The camels at that time caught my imagination, and Satan, who talked like that with God, and God who gave His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) servant up to destruction, and His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) servant crying out:
<p/>Blessed be the name of the Lord for ever and ever. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Blessed be Thy name although Thou dost punish me,''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>and then the soft and sweet singing in the church:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let my prayer rise up before Thee,''  (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div>and again incense from the priest's censer and the kneeling and the prayer. Ever since then--only yesterday I took it up--I've never been able to read that sacred tale without tears.
<p/>Afterwards I heard the words of mockery and blame, proud words, <div class="bookquote">``How could God give up the most loved of His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) saints for the diversion of the devil, take from him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) children, smite him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) with sore boils so that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) cleansed the corruption from his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) sores with a pot-sherd--and for no object except to boast to the devil! '
<p/>And how much that is great, mysterious and unfathomable there is in it! See what My saint can suffer for My sake.'
<p/>But the greatness of it lies just in the fact that it is a mystery--that the passing earthly show and the eternal verity are brought together in it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>In the face of the earthly truth, the eternal truth is accomplished. The Creator, just as on the first days of creation He (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) ended each day with praise:
<p/>And Job, praising the Lord, serves not only Him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) but all His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) creation for generations and generations, and for ever and ever, since for that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was ordained.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is good that I have created,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>looks upon Job and again praises His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) creation. Good heavens, what a book it is, and what lessons there are in it!
<p/>It is like a mold cast of the world and man and human nature, everything is there, and a law for everything for all the ages.
<p/>What a book the Bible is, what a miracle, what strength is given with it to man! And what mysteries are solved and revealed!
<p/>God raises Job again, gives him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wealth again. Many years pass by, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has other children and loves them. But how could he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) love those new ones when those first children are no more, when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has lost them?
<p/>Remembering them, how could he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) be fully happy with those new ones, however dear the new ones might be? But he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could.
<p/>It's the great mystery of human life that old grief passes gradually into quiet, tender joy. The mild serenity of age takes the place of the riotous blood of youth.
<p/>I bless the rising sun each day, and, as before, my hearts sings to meet it, but now I love even more its setting, its long slanting rays and the soft, tender, gentle memories that come with them, the dear images from the whole of my long, happy life--and over all the Divine Truth, softening, reconciling, forgiving!
<p/>I feel how my earthly life is in touch with a new infinite, unknown, that approaching life, the nearness of which sets my soul quivering with rapture, my mind glowing and my heart weeping with joy.
<p/>Friends and teachers, I have heard more than once, and of late one may hear it more often, that the priests, and above all the village priests, are complaining on all sides of their miserable income and their humiliating lot.
<p/>My life is ending, I know that well, but every day that is left me They plainly state, even in print--
<p/>I've read it myself--that they are unable to teach the Scriptures to the people because of the smallness of their means, and if Lutherans and heretics come and lead the flock astray, they let them lead them astray because they have so little to live upon.
<p/>May the Lord increase the sustenance that is so precious to them, for their complaint is just, too. But of a truth I say, if any one is to blame in the matter, half the fault is ours.
<p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) may be short of time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) may say truly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) is overwhelmed all the while with work and services, but still it's not all the time, even he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) has an hour a week to remember God.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gather round him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) once a week, some hour in the evening, if only the children at first--the fathers will hear of it and they too will begin to come.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) does not work the whole year round. There's no need to build halls for this, let him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) take them into his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own cottage.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) open that book and begin reading it without grand words or superciliousness, without condescension to them, but gently and kindly, being glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is reading to them and that they are listening with attention, loving the words himself, only stopping from time to time to explain words that are not understood by the peasants.
<p/>They won't spoil his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cottage, they would only be there one hour. Don't be anxious, they will understand everything, the orthodox heart will understand all!
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) read them about Abraham and Sarah, about Isaac and Rebecca, of how Jacob went to Laban and wrestled with the Lord in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) dream and said, <div class="bookquote">``This place is holy'' (<font color='red'><b>the Lord</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) will impress the devout mind of the peasant.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) read, especially to the children, how the brothers sold Joseph, the tender boy, the dreamer and prophet, into bondage, and told their father that a wild beast had devoured him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) blood- stained clothes.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) read them how the brothers afterwards journeyed into Egypt for corn, and Joseph, already a great ruler, unrecognized by them, tormented them, accused them, kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) brother Benjamin, and all through love: <div class="bookquote">``I love you, and loving you I torment you.
<p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) remembered all his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) life how they had sold him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) to the merchants in the burning desert by the well, and how, wringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) had wept and besought his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) brothers not to sell him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) as a slave in a strange land.
<p/>And how, seeing them again after many years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) loved them beyond measure, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) harassed and tormented them in love.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) left them at last not able to bear the suffering of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) heart, flung himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) bed and wept.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>brother Benjamin</b></font>)</div>Then, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) tears away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) went out to them joyful and told them, <div class="bookquote">``Brothers, I am your brother Joseph!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) read them further how happy old Jacob was on learning that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) darling boy was still alive, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) went to Egypt leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) own country, and died in a foreign land, bequeathing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) great prophecy that had lain mysteriously hidden in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) meek and timid heart all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) life, that from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jacob</b></font>) offspring, from Judah, will come the great hope of the world, the Messiah and Saviour.
<p/>Fathers and teachers, forgive me and don't be angry, that like a little child I've been babbling of what you know long ago, and can teach me a hundred times more skillfully.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) too weep, the priest of God, and be sure that the hearts of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) listeners will throb in response.
<p/>Only a little tiny seed is needed--drop it into the heart of the peasant and it won't die, it will live in his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) soul all his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) life, it will be hidden in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) darkness and sin, like a bright spot, like a great reminder.
<p/>I only speak from rapture, and forgive my tears, for I love the Bible. And there's no need of much teaching or explanation, he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) will understand it all simply.
<p/>Try reading them the touching story of the fair Esther and the haughty Vashti; or the miraculous story of Jonah in the whale.
<p/>Don't forget either the parables of Our Lord, choose especially from the Gospel of St. Luke -LRB-that is what I did-RRB-, and then from the Acts of the Apostles the conversion of St. Paul -LRB-that you mustn't leave out on any account-RRB-, and from the Lives of the Saints , for instance, the life of Alexey, the man of God and, greatest of all, the happy martyr and the seer of God, Mary of Egypt--and you will penetrate their hearts with these simple tales.
<p/>Do you suppose that the peasants don't understand? Give one hour a week to it in spite of your poverty, only one little hour.
<p/>Mindful of the kindness of their priest and the moving words they have heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), they will of their own accord help him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) fields and in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) house, and will treat him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) with more respect than before--so that it will even increase his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) worldly well-being too.
<p/>The thing is so simple that sometimes one is even afraid to put it into words, for fear of being laughed at, and yet how true it is!
<p/>And you will see for yourselves that our people is gracious and grateful, and will repay you a hundred-fold. One who does not believe in God will not believe in God's people.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) who believes in God's people will see His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) Holiness too, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had not believed in it till then.
<p/>Only the people and their future spiritual power will convert our atheists, who have torn themselves away from their native soil.
<p/>The people is lost without the Word of God, for its soul is athirst for the Word and for all that is good.
<p/>In my youth, long ago, nearly forty years ago, I traveled all over Russia with Father Anfim, collecting funds for our monastery, and we stayed one night on the bank of a great navigable river with some fishermen.
<p/>A good- looking peasant lad, about eighteen, joined us; he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had to hurry back next morning to pull a merchant's barge along the bank.
<p/>And what is the use of Christ's words, unless we set an example? I noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) looking straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) with clear and tender eyes.
<p/>a bright, warm, still, July night, a cool mist rose from the broad river, we could hear the plash of a fish, the birds were still, all was hushed and beautiful, everything praying to God.
<p/>Only we two were not sleeping, the lad and I, and we talked of the beauty of this world of God's and of the great mystery of it.
<p/>Every blade of grass, every insect, ant, and golden bee, all so marvelously know their path, though they have not intelligence, they bear witness to the mystery of God and continually accomplish it themselves.
<p/>It was I saw the dear lad's heart was moved. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) loved the forest and the forest birds.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was a bird-catcher, knew the note of each of them, could call each bird. '' I know nothing better than to be in the forest,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``though all things are good.
<p/>Look,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``at the horse, that great beast that is so near to man; or the lowly, pensive ox, which feeds him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and works for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); look at their faces, what meekness, what devotion to man, who often beats them mercilessly.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Truly,'' I answered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``all things are good and fair, because all is truth. What gentleness, what confidence and what beauty!
<p/>It's touching to know that there's no sin in them, for all, all except man, is sinless, and Christ has been with them before us.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>asked the boy, <div class="bookquote">``is Christ with them too?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>'' It cannot but be so,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``since the Word is for all.
<p/>All creation and all creatures, every leaf is striving to the Word, singing glory to God, weeping to Christ, unconsciously accomplishing this by the mystery of their sinless life.
<p/>And I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) how once a bear came to a great saint who had taken refuge in a tiny cell in the wood.
<p/>Yonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``in the forest wanders the dreadful bear, fierce and menacing, and yet innocent in it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And the great saint pitied him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>), went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) without fear and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) a piece of bread.
<p/>'' Go along,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Christ be with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the savage beast walked away meekly and obediently, doing no harm.
<p/>And the lad was delighted that the bear had walked away without hurting the saint, and that Christ was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) too.
<p/>'' Ah,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``how good that is, how good and beautiful is all God's work! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sat musing softly and sweetly.
<p/>I saw he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) understood. And he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) slept beside me a light and sinless sleep. May God bless youth! And I prayed for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) as I went to sleep.
<p/>Lord, send peace and light to Thy people! Chapter II. The Duel -LRB-c-RRB- Recollections of Father Zossima's Youth before he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) became a Monk.
<p/>I spent a long time, almost eight years, in the military cadet school at Petersburg, and in the novelty of my surroundings there, many of my childish impressions grew dimmer, though I forgot nothing.
<p/>The Duel I picked up so many new habits and opinions that I was transformed into a cruel, absurd, almost savage creature.
<p/>A surface polish of courtesy and society manners I did acquire together with the French language. But we all, myself included, looked upon the soldiers in our service as cattle.
<p/>By the time we left the school as officers, we were ready to lay down our lives for the honor of the regiment, but no one of us had any knowledge of the real meaning of honor, and if any one had known it, he (<font color='blue'><b>soldiers</b></font>) would have been the first to ridicule it.
<p/>I was perhaps worse than the rest in that respect, for I was so much more impressionable than my companions. Drunkenness, debauchery and devilry were what we almost prided ourselves on.
<p/>I don't say that we were bad by nature, all these young men were good fellows, but they behaved badly, and I worst of all.
<p/>What made it worse for me was that I had come into my own money, and so I flung myself into a life of pleasure, and plunged headlong into all the recklessness of youth.
<p/>I was fond of reading, yet strange to say, the Bible was the one book I never opened at that time, though I always carried it about with me, and I was never separated from it; in very truth I was keeping that book <div class="bookquote">``for the day and the hour, for the month and the year,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>though I knew it not.
<p/>After four years of this life, I chanced to be in the town of K. where our regiment was stationed at the time.
<p/>I met with a cordial reception everywhere, as I was of a lively temperament and was known to be well off, which always goes a long way in the world.
<p/>We found the people of the town hospitable, rich and fond of entertainments. And then a circumstance happened which was the beginning of it all.
<p/>I formed an attachment to a beautiful and intelligent young girl of noble and lofty character, the daughter of people much respected.
<p/>They were well-to-do people of influence and position. They always gave me a cordial and friendly reception. I fancied that the young lady looked on me with favor and my heart was aflame at such an idea.
<p/>Later on I saw and fully realized that I perhaps was not so passionately in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) at all, but only recognized the elevation of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind and character, which I could not indeed have helped doing.
<p/>I was prevented, however, from making her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) an offer at the time by my selfishness, I was loath to part with the allurements of my free and licentious bachelor life in the heyday of my youth, and with my pockets full of money.
<p/>I did drop some hint as to my feelings however, though I put off taking any decisive step for a time.
<p/>On my return two months later, I found the young lady already married to a rich neighboring landowner, a very amiable man, still young though older than I was, connected with the best Petersburg society, which I was not, and of excellent education, which I also was not.
<p/>Then, all of a sudden, we were ordered off for two months to another district. I was so overwhelmed at this unexpected circumstance that my mind was positively clouded.
<p/>The worst of it all was that, as I learned then, the young landowner had been a long while betrothed to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and I had met him (<font color='blue'><b>landowner</b></font>) indeed many times in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) house, but blinded by my conceit
<p/>I had noticed nothing. And this particularly mortified me; almost everybody had known all about it, while I knew nothing. I was filled with sudden irrepressible fury.
<p/>With flushed face I began recalling how often I had been on the point of declaring my love to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had not attempted to stop me or to warn me, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must, I concluded, have been laughing at me all the time.
<p/>Later on, of course, I reflected and remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been very far from laughing at me; on the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) used to turn off any love-making on my part with a jest and begin talking of other subjects; but at that moment I was incapable of reflecting and was all eagerness for revenge.
<p/>I am surprised to remember that my wrath and revengeful feelings were extremely repugnant to my own nature, for being of an easy temper, I found it difficult to be angry with any one for long, and so I had to work myself up artificially and became at last revolting and absurd.
<p/>I insulted him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) on a perfectly extraneous pretext, jeering at his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) opinion upon an important public event--it was in the year
<p/>I waited for an opportunity and succeeded in insulting my <div class="bookquote">``rival''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>in the presence of a large company. 1826-LRB-5-RRB---and my jeer was, so people said, clever and effective.
<p/>Then I forced him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to ask for an explanation, and behaved so rudely that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) accepted my challenge in spite of the vast inequality between us, as I was younger, a person of no consequence, and of inferior rank.
<p/>I learned afterwards for a fact that it was from a jealous feeling on his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) side also that my challenge was accepted; he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had been rather jealous of me on his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wife's account before their marriage; he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fancied now that if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) submitted to be insulted by me and refused to accept my challenge, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heard of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might begin to despise him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and waver in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) love for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>In those days though duels were severely punished, yet dueling was a kind of fashion among the officers--so strong and deeply rooted will a brutal prejudice sometimes be.
<p/>It was the end of June, and our meeting was to take place at seven o'clock the next day on the outskirts of the town--and then something happened that in very truth was the turning-point of my life.
<p/>In the evening, returning home in a savage and brutal humor, I flew into a rage with my orderly Afanasy, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) two blows in the face with all my might, so that it was covered with blood.
<p/>I soon found a second in a comrade, an ensign of our regiment. He (<font color='blue'><b>ensign</b></font>) had not long been in my service
<p/>and I had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>ensign</b></font>) before, but never with such ferocious cruelty. And, believe me, though it's forty years ago, I recall it now with shame and pain.
<p/>I went to bed and slept for about three hours; when I waked up the day was breaking. I got up--I did not want to sleep any more--I went to the window--opened it
<p/>, it looked out upon the garden; I saw the sun rising; it was warm and beautiful, the birds were singing.
<p/>'' What's the meaning of it? '' I thought. '' I feel in my heart as it were something vile and shameful.
<p/>Is it because I am going to shed blood? No,'' I thought, <div class="bookquote">``I feel it's not that. Can it be that I am afraid of death, afraid of being killed?
<p/>No, that's not it, that's not it at all. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>... And all at once I knew what it was: it was because I had beaten Afanasy the evening before!
<p/>It all rose before my mind, it all was as it were repeated over again; he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stood before me and I was beating him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) straight on the face
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was holding his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) arms stiffly down, his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head erect, his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes fixed upon me as though on parade. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) staggered at every blow and did not even dare to raise his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hands to protect himself.
<p/>That is what a man has been brought to, and that was a man beating a fellow creature! What a crime!
<p/>I stood as if I were struck dumb, while the sun was shining, the leaves were rejoicing and the birds were trilling the praise of God
<p/>It was as though a sharp dagger had pierced me right through. .... I hid my face in my hands, fell on my bed and broke into a storm of tears.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My dear ones, why do you wait on me, why do you love me, am I worth your waiting on me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And then I remembered my brother Markel and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Markel</b></font>) said on his (<font color='blue'><b>Markel</b></font>) death-bed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Markel</b></font>) servants: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, am I worth it?
<p/>After all what am I worth, that another man, a fellow creature, made in the likeness and image of God, should serve me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>servants</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had said, <div class="bookquote">``Mother, my little heart, in truth we are each responsible to all for all, it's only that men don't know this.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>flashed through my mind. '' For the first time in my life this question forced itself upon me. If they knew it, the world would be a paradise at once.
<p/>In truth, perhaps, I am more than all others responsible for all, a greater sinner than all men in the world.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``God, can that too be false? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought as I wept. '' '' And all at once the whole truth in its full light appeared to me; what was I going to do?
<p/>I was going to kill a good, clever, noble man, who had done me no wrong, and by depriving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife of happiness for the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) life, I should be torturing and killing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) too.
<p/>I lay thus in my bed with my face in the pillow, heedless how the time was passing. Suddenly my second, the ensign, came in with the pistols to fetch me.
<p/>'' Ah,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>ensign</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it's a good thing you are up already, it's time we were off, come along! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I did not know what to do and hurried to and fro undecided; we went out to the carriage, however.
<p/>'' Wait here a minute,'' I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>ensign</b></font>). '' I'll be back directly, I have forgotten my purse. '' And I ran back alone, to Afanasy's little room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>ensign</b></font>) started as though he (<font color='blue'><b>ensign</b></font>) were frightened, and looked at me; and I saw that it was not enough, and on the spot, in my full officer's uniform, I dropped at his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) feet and bowed my head to the ground.
<p/>'' Afanasy,'' I said, <div class="bookquote">``I gave you two blows on the face yesterday, forgive me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. '' Forgive me,'' I said.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) burst out crying as I had done before, hid this face in his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) hands, turned to the window and shook all over with his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) sobs.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was completely aghast. '' Your honor ... sir, what are you doing? Am I worth it? '' I flew out to my comrade and jumped into the carriage.
<p/>'' Ready,'' I cried. '' Have you ever seen a conqueror? '' I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>conqueror</b></font>). '' Here is one before you.
<p/>'' I was in ecstasy, laughing and talking all the way, I don't remember what about. He (<font color='blue'><b>conqueror</b></font>) looked at me. ''
<p/>Well, brother, you are a plucky fellow, you'll keep up the honor of the uniform, I can see. '' So we reached the place and found them there, waiting us.
<p/>I stood gayly, looking him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) full in the face; I did not twitch an eyelash, I looked lovingly at him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), for I knew what I would do.
<p/>Thank God,'' I cried, <div class="bookquote">``no man has been killed,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and I seized my pistol, turned back and flung it far away into the wood.
<p/>We were placed twelve paces apart; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the first shot. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shot just grazed my cheek and ear. '' ''
<p/>Forgive me, young fool that I am, sir,'' I said, <div class="bookquote">``for my unprovoked insult to you and for forcing you to fire at me.
<p/>That's the place for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried. I turned to my adversary. '' I am ten times worse than you and more, maybe.
<p/>Tell that to the person whom you hold dearest in the world. '' I had no sooner said this than they all three shouted at me.
<p/>Upon my word,'' cried my adversary, annoyed, <div class="bookquote">``if you did not want to fight, why did not you let me alone?''
 (<font color='red'><b>adversary</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' Yesterday I was a fool, to-day I know better,'' I answered him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) gayly. '' As to yesterday, I believe you, but as for to-day, it is difficult to agree with your opinion,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).
<p/>'' Bravo,'' I cried, clapping my hands. '' I agree with you there too. I have deserved it!'' <div class="bookquote">``Will you shoot, sir, or not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>No, I won't,'' I said; ``if you like, fire at me again, but it would be better for you not to fire.
<p/>The seconds, especially mine, were shouting too: <div class="bookquote">``Can you disgrace the regiment like this, facing your antagonist and begging his (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) forgiveness!
<p/>Gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``is it really so wonderful in these days to find a man who can repent of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stupidity and publicly confess his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrongdoing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' If I'd only known this! '' I stood facing them all, not laughing now. '' <div class="bookquote">``But not in a duel,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried my second again.
<p/>For I ought to have owned my fault as soon as I got here, before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had fired a shot, before leading him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into a great and deadly sin; but we have made our life so grotesque, that to act in that way would have been almost impossible, for only after I have faced his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shot at the distance of twelve paces
<p/>could my words have any significance for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and if I had spoken before, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have said, `He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a coward, the sight of the pistols has frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), no use to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).'
<p/>Gentlemen,'' I cried suddenly, speaking straight from my heart, <div class="bookquote">``look around you at the gifts of God, the clear sky, the pure air, the tender grass, the birds; nature is beautiful and sinless, and we, only we, are sinful and foolish, and we don't understand that life is heaven, for we have only to understand that and it will at once be fulfilled in all its beauty, we shall embrace each other and weep.
<p/>but I could not; my voice broke with the sweetness and youthful gladness of it, and there was such bliss in my heart as I had never known before in my life.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>That's what's so strange,'' I said. '' '' I would have said more '' All this as rational and edifying,'' said my antagonist, <div class="bookquote">``and in any case you are an original person.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>antagonist person</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You may laugh,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>antagonist</b></font>), laughing too, <div class="bookquote">``but afterwards you will approve of me.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, I am ready to approve of you now,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>antagonist</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``will you shake hands?
<p/>No,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``not now, later on when I have grown worthier and deserve your esteem, then shake hands and you will do well.
<p/>for I believe you are genuinely sincere. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' We went home, my second upbraiding me all the way, while I kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>antagonist</b></font>).
<p/>All my comrades heard of the affair at once and gathered together to pass judgment on me the same day. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>antagonist</b></font>) has disgraced the uniform,'' they said; <div class="bookquote">``let him (<font color='blue'><b>antagonist</b></font>) resign his (<font color='blue'><b>antagonist</b></font>) commission. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Some stood up for me: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>antagonist</b></font>) faced the shot,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>they said.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>antagonist</b></font>) had been afraid of being shot, he (<font color='blue'><b>antagonist</b></font>) would have shot his (<font color='blue'><b>antagonist</b></font>) own pistol first before asking forgiveness, while he (<font color='blue'><b>antagonist</b></font>) flung it loaded into the forest.
<p/>'' Yes, but he (<font color='blue'><b>antagonist</b></font>) was afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>antagonist</b></font>) other shot and begged for forgiveness. '' '' No, there's something else in this, something original.
<p/>'' I enjoyed listening and looking at them. '' My dear friends and comrades,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``don't worry about my resigning my commission, for I have done so already.
<p/>I have sent in my papers this morning and as soon as I get my discharge I shall go into a monastery--it's with that object I am leaving the regiment.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>When I had said this every one of them burst out laughing. '' You should have told us of that first, that explains everything, we can't judge a monk.
<p/>They all felt friendly to me at once, even those who had been sternest in their censure, and all the following month, before my discharge came, they could not make enough of me.
<p/>'' They laughed and could not stop themselves, and not scornfully, but kindly and merrily. '' Ah, you monk,'' they would say.
<p/>And every one said something kind to me, they began trying to dissuade me, even to pity me: <div class="bookquote">``What are you doing to yourself?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>No,'' they would say, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) is a brave fellow, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) faced fire and could have fired his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) own pistol too, but he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had a dream the night before that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) should become a monk, that's why he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) did it.
<p/>Till then I had been kindly received, but had not been the object of special attention, and now all came to know me at once and invited me; they laughed at me, but they loved me.
<p/>I may mention that although everybody talked openly of our duel, the authorities took no notice of it, because my antagonist was a near relation of our general, and as there had been no bloodshed and no serious consequences, and as I resigned my commission, they took it as a joke.
<p/>And I began then to speak aloud and fearlessly, regardless of their laughter, for it was always kindly and not spiteful laughter.
<p/>These conversations mostly took place in the evenings, in the company of ladies; women particularly liked listening to me then and they made the men listen.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' It was the same thing with the society of the town. '' But how can I possibly be responsible for all?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may well not know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I would answer, <div class="bookquote">``since the whole world has long been going on a different line, since we consider the veriest lies as truth and demand the same lies from others.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>every one would laugh in my face. '' Can I, for instance, be responsible for you?'' Here I have for once in my life acted sincerely and, well, you all look upon me as a madman.
<p/>Though you are friendly to me, yet, you see, you all laugh at me.'' '' But how can we help being friendly to you?'' said my hostess, laughing.
<p/>All of a sudden the young lady rose, on whose account the duel had been fought and whom only lately I had intended to be my future wife.
<p/>The room was full of people. I had not noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) coming into the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) got up, came to me and held out her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Let me tell you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that I am the first not to laugh at you, but on the contrary I thank you with tears and express my respect for you for your action then.
<p/>My heart was filled with joy, but my attention was especially caught by a middle-aged man who came up to me with the others.
<p/>I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by name already, but had never made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) acquaintance nor exchanged a word with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) till that evening.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, too, came up and then they all approached me and almost kissed me. -LRB-d-RRB- The Mysterious Visitor
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Visitor</b></font>) had long been an official in the town; he (<font color='blue'><b>Visitor</b></font>) was in a prominent position, respected by all, rich and had a reputation for benevolence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Visitor</b></font>) subscribed considerable sums to the almshouse and the orphan asylum; he (<font color='blue'><b>Visitor</b></font>) was very charitable, too, in secret, a fact which only became known after his (<font color='blue'><b>Visitor</b></font>) death.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Visitor</b></font>) was a man of about fifty, almost stern in appearance and not much given to conversation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Visitor</b></font>) had been married about ten years and his (<font color='blue'><b>Visitor</b></font>) wife, who was still young, had borne him (<font color='blue'><b>Visitor</b></font>) three children.
<p/>Well, I was sitting alone in my room the following evening, when my door suddenly opened and this gentleman walked in.
<p/>I must mention, by the way, that I was no longer living in my former quarters. As soon as I resigned my commission, I took rooms with an old lady, the widow of a government clerk.
<p/>My landlady's servant waited upon me, for I had moved into her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) rooms simply because on my return from the duel I had sent Afanasy back to the regiment, as I felt ashamed to look him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) in the face after my last interview with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).
<p/>So prone is the man of the world to be ashamed of any righteous action. '' I have,'' said my visitor, <div class="bookquote">``with great interest listened to you speaking in different houses the last few days
<p/>and I wanted at last to make your personal acquaintance, so as to talk to you more intimately. Can you, dear sir, grant me this favor?''
 (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div><p/>I said this, though I felt almost dismayed, so greatly was I impressed from the first moment by the appearance of this man.
<p/>For though other people had listened to me with interest and attention, no one had come to me before with such a serious, stern and concentrated expression.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can, with the greatest pleasure, and I shall look upon it as an honor. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come to see me in my own rooms.
<p/>You are, I see, a man of great strength of character,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``as you have dared to serve the truth, even when by doing so you risked incurring the contempt of all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat down. '' <div class="bookquote">``Your praise is, perhaps, excessive,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied. '' No, it's not excessive,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered; <div class="bookquote">``believe me, such a course of action is far more difficult than you think.
<p/>It is that which has impressed me, and it is only on that account that I have come to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, please, that is if you are not annoyed by my perhaps unseemly curiosity, what were your exact sensations, if you can recall them, at the moment when you made up your mind to ask forgiveness at the duel.
<p/>Do not think my question frivolous; on the contrary, I have in asking the question a secret motive of my own, which I will perhaps explain to you later on, if it is God's will that we should become more intimately acquainted.
<p/>and I felt all at once a complete trust in him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and great curiosity on my side also, for I felt that there was some strange secret in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>All the while he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was speaking, I was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) straight into the face '' You ask what were my exact sensations at the moment when I asked my opponent's forgiveness,'' I answered;
<p/>And I described all that had passed between Afanasy and me, and how I had bowed down to the ground at his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) feet.
<p/>From that you can see for yourself,'' I concluded, ``that at the time of the duel it was easier for me, for I had made a beginning already at home, and when once I had started on that road, to go farther along it was far from being difficult, but became a source of joy and happiness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but I had better tell you from the beginning what I have not yet told any one else. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' ''
<p/>I liked the way he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) looked at me as he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) listened. '' All that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``is exceedingly interesting. I will come to see you again and again.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And from that time forth he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) came to see me nearly every evening. And we should have become greater friends, if only he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) had ever talked of himself.
<p/>In spite of that I became very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) and spoke with perfect frankness to him (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) about all my feelings; <div class="bookquote">``for,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>thought I, <div class="bookquote">``what need
<p/>But about himself he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) scarcely ever said a word, yet continually asked me about myself. have I to know his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) secrets, since I can see without that that he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) is a good man?
<p/>Moreover, though he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) is such a serious man and my senior, he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) comes to see a youngster like me and treats me as his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) equal.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And I learned a great deal that was profitable from him (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) was a man of lofty mind. ''
<p/>That life is heaven,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) said to me suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``that I have long been thinking about'' (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>; and all at once he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I think of nothing else indeed.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) looked at me and smiled. '' I am more convinced of it than you are, I will tell you later why.
<p/>Heaven,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``lies hidden within all of us--here it lies hidden in me now, and if I will it, it will be revealed to me to-morrow and for all time.
<p/>I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) was speaking with great emotion and gazing mysteriously at me, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) were questioning me.
<p/>And that we are all responsible to all for all, apart from our own sins, you were quite right in thinking that, and it is wonderful how you could comprehend it in all its significance at once.
<p/>And in very truth, so soon as men understand that, the Kingdom of Heaven will be for them not a dream, but a living reality.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' I listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) and thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) evidently wanted to tell me something. '' '' '' '' And when,'' I cried out to him (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) bitterly, <div class="bookquote">``when will that come to pass?
<p/>and will it ever come to pass? Is not it simply a dream of ours?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What then, you don't believe it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) said.
<p/>Believe me, this dream, as you call it, will come to pass without doubt; it will come, but not now, for every process has its law.
<p/>'' You preach it and don't believe it yourself. It's a spiritual, psychological process. To transform the world, to recreate it afresh, men must turn into another path psychologically.
<p/>No sort of scientific teaching, no kind of common interest, will ever teach men to share property and privileges with equal consideration for all.
<p/>Until you have become really, in actual fact, a brother to every one, brotherhood will not come to pass. Every one will think his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) share too small and they will be always envying, complaining and attacking one another.
<p/>You ask when it will come to pass; it will come to pass, but first we have to go through the period of isolation.
<p/>Why, the isolation that prevails everywhere, above all in our age--it has not fully developed, it has not reached its limit yet.
<p/>For every one strives to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) individuality as apart as possible, wishes to secure the greatest possible fullness of life for himself; but meantime all his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) efforts result not in attaining fullness of life but self-destruction, for instead of self-realization he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ends by arriving at complete solitude.
<p/>All mankind in our age have split up into units, they all keep apart, each in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own groove; each one holds aloof, hides himself and hides what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has, from the rest, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ends by being repelled by others and repelling them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) heaps up riches by himself and thinks, `How strong I am now and how secure,' and in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) madness he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) does not understand that the more he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) heaps up, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sinks into self-destructive impotence.
<p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is accustomed to rely upon himself alone and to cut himself off from the whole; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has trained himself not to believe in the help of others, in men and in humanity, and only trembles for fear he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should lose his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) money and the privileges that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has won for himself.
<p/>Everywhere in these days men have, in their mockery, ceased to understand that the true security is to be found in social solidarity rather than in isolated individual effort.
<p/>But this terrible individualism must inevitably have an end, and all will suddenly understand how unnaturally they are separated from one another.
<p/>It will be the spirit of the time, and people will marvel that they have sat so long in darkness without seeing the light.
<p/>'' '' What do you mean by isolation? '' I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). '' And then the sign of the Son of Man will be seen in the heavens....
<p/>Sometimes even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) has to do it alone, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) conduct seems to be crazy, a man must set an example, and so draw men's souls out of their solitude, and spur them to some act of brotherly love, that the great idea may not die.
<p/>But, until then, we must keep the banner flying. '' Our evenings, one after another, were spent in such stirring and fervent talk.
<p/>I say this, not as blame, for they still loved me and treated me good-humoredly, but there's no denying that fashion is a great power in society.
<p/>I began to regard my mysterious visitor with admiration, for besides enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) intelligence, I began to perceive that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was brooding over some plan in his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) heart, and was preparing himself perhaps for a great deed.
<p/>Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) liked my not showing curiosity about his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) secret, not seeking to discover it by direct question nor by insinuation.
<p/>I gave up society and visited my neighbors much less frequently. Besides, my vogue was somewhat over. But I noticed at last, that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) seemed to show signs of wanting to tell me something.
<p/>Do you know,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) said to me once, <div class="bookquote">``that people are very inquisitive about us in the town and wonder why I come to see you so often.
<p/>This had become quite evident, indeed, about a month after he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) first began to visit me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>But let them wonder, for soon all will be explained .
<p/>Sometimes an extraordinary agitation would come over him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), and almost always on such occasions he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) would get up and go away.
<p/>'' Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) would fix a long piercing look upon me, and I thought, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) will say something directly now. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>One day, quite unexpectedly indeed, after he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had been talking with great fervor a long time, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) suddenly turn pale, and his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) face worked convulsively, while he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) stared persistently at me.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) would suddenly begin talking of something ordinary and familiar. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) often complained of headache too. '' What's the matter?
<p/>'' I said; <div class="bookquote">``do you feel ill?'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had just been complaining of headache. '' I ... do you know ... I murdered some one.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) said this and smiled with a face as white as chalk. '' Why is it he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) is smiling? ''
<p/>The thought flashed through my mind before I realized anything else. I too turned pale. '' What are you saying? ''
<p/>I cried. '' You see,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) said, with a pale smile, <div class="bookquote">``how much it has cost me to say the first word.
<p/>For a long while I could not believe him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), and I did not believe him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) at that time, but only after he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had been to see me three days running and told me all about it.
<p/>Now I have said it, I feel I've taken the first step and shall go on. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was mad, but ended by being convinced, to my great grief and amazement.
<p/>Fourteen years before, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had murdered the widow of a landowner, a wealthy and handsome young woman who had a house in our town.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) crime was a great and terrible one. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) fell passionately in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), declared his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) feeling and tried to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>).
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had already given her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart to another man, an officer of noble birth and high rank in the service, who was at that time away at the front, though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) soon to return.
<p/>After he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had ceased to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) took advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) knowledge of the house to enter at night through the garden by the roof, at great risk of discovery.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) refused his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) offer and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) not to come and see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). But, as often happens, a crime committed with extraordinary audacity is more successful than others.
<p/>Entering the garret through the skylight, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) went down the ladder, knowing that the door at the bottom of it was sometimes, through the negligence of the servants, left unlocked.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) hoped to find it so, and so it was. He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) way in the dark to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bedroom, where a light was burning.
<p/>As though on purpose, both her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) maids had gone off to a birthday-party in the same street, without asking leave. The other servants slept in the servants' quarters or in the kitchen on the ground-floor.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) passion flamed up at the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asleep, and then vindictive, jealous anger took possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) heart, and like a drunken man, beside himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) thrust a knife into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not even cry out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was so base as to take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) purse, to open her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chest with keys from under her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pillow, and to take some things from it, doing it all as it might have been done by an ignorant servant, leaving valuable papers and taking only money.
<p/>Then with devilish and criminal cunning he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) contrived that suspicion should fall on the servants. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) took some of the larger gold things, but left smaller articles that were ten times as valuable.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) took with him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), too, some things for himself as remembrances, but of that later. Having done this awful deed, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) returned by the way he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had come.
<p/>Neither the next day, when the alarm was raised, nor at any time after in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) life, did any one dream of suspecting that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was the criminal.
<p/>No one indeed knew of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was always reserved and silent and had no friend to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would have opened his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was looked upon simply as an acquaintance, and not a very intimate one, of the murdered woman, as for the previous fortnight he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had not even visited her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>The man knew--indeed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mistress did not conceal the fact--that having to send one of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) serfs as a recruit she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had decided to send him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no relations and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conduct was unsatisfactory.
<p/>A serf of hers called Pyotr was at once suspected, and every circumstance confirmed the suspicion. People had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) angrily threatening to murder her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was drunk in a tavern.
<p/>The day after the murder, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was found on the road leading out of the town, dead drunk, with a knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right hand happened to be stained with blood.
<p/>Two days before her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) death, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had run away, staying no one knew where in the town. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) declared that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose had been bleeding, but no one believed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>The maids confessed that they had gone to a party and that the street-door had been left open till they returned.
<p/>They arrested him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was tried for the murder; but a week after the arrest, the prisoner fell sick of a fever and died unconscious in the hospital.
<p/>There the matter ended and the judges and the authorities and every one in the town remained convinced that the crime had been committed by no one but the servant who had died in the hospital.
<p/>And a number of similar details came to light, throwing suspicion on the innocent servant. And after that the punishment began.
<p/>My mysterious visitor, now my friend, told me that at first he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was not in the least troubled by pangs of conscience.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was miserable a long time, but not for that reason; only from regret that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had killed the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) loved, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was no more, that in killing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had killed his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) love, while the fire of passion was still in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) veins.
<p/>The thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) victim might have become the wife of another man was insupportable to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and so, for a long time, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was convinced in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) conscience that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could not have acted otherwise.
<p/>At first he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was worried at the arrest of the servant, but his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) illness and death soon set his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mind at rest, for the man's death was apparently -LRB-so he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) reflected at the time-RRB- not owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) arrest or his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fright, but a chill he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had taken on the day he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) ran away, when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had lain all night dead drunk on the damp ground.
<p/>The theft of the money and other things troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) little, for he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) argued that the theft had not been committed for gain but to avert suspicion.
<p/>The sum stolen was small, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) shortly afterwards subscribed the whole of it, and much more, towards the funds for maintaining an almshouse in the town.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did this on purpose to set his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) conscience at rest about the theft, and it's a remarkable fact that for a long time he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) really was at peace
<p/>But of the innocent blood he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had shed, of the murder of a fellow creature, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) scarcely thought. --he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) told me this himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) entered then upon a career of great activity in the service, volunteered for a difficult and laborious duty, which occupied him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) two years, and being a man of strong will almost forgot the past.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became active in philanthropy too, founded and helped to maintain many institutions in the town, did a good deal in the two capitals, and in both Moscow and Petersburg was elected a member of philanthropic societies.
<p/>Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) recalled it, he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) tried not to think of it at all. At last, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) began brooding over the past, and the strain of it was too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>).
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) was attracted by a fine and intelligent girl and soon after married her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), hoping that marriage would dispel his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) lonely depression, and that by entering on a new life and scrupulously doing his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) duty to his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) wife and children, he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) would escape from old memories altogether.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) began, even in the first month of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) marriage, to be continually fretted by the thought, <div class="bookquote">``My wife loves me--but what if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew?
<p/>But the very opposite of what he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) expected happened. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) first told him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would soon bear him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) a child, he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) was troubled.
<p/>'' I am giving life, but I have taken life. '' Children came. '' How dare I love them, teach and educate them
<p/>They were splendid children, he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) longed to caress them; <div class="bookquote">``and I can't look at their innocent candid faces, I am unworthy.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) began to be bitterly and ominously haunted by the blood of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) murdered victim, by the young life he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had destroyed, by the blood that cried out for vengeance.
<p/>, how can I talk to them of virtue? I have shed blood. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had begun to have awful dreams.
<p/>But, being a man of fortitude, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bore his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suffering a long time, thinking: <div class="bookquote">``I shall expiate everything by this secret agony.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But that hope, too, was vain; the longer it went on, the more intense was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suffering. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was respected in society for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) active benevolence, though every one was overawed by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stern and gloomy character.
<p/>But the more he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was respected, the more intolerable it was for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) confessed to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had thoughts of killing himself.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to be haunted by another idea--an idea which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had at first regarded as impossible and unthinkable, though at last it got such a hold on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not shake it off.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dreamed of rising up, going out and confessing in the face of all men that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had committed murder. For three years this dream had pursued him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), haunting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in different forms.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole heart that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) confessed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crime, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would heal his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul and would be at peace for ever.
<p/>But this belief filled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart with terror, for how could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carry it out? And then came what happened at my duel.
<p/>Is it possible,'' I cried, clasping my hands, <div class="bookquote">``that such a trivial incident could give rise to such a resolution in you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>My resolution has been growing for the last three years,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``and your story only gave the last touch to it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Looking at you, I have made up my mind. '' I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' '' Looking at you, I reproached myself and envied you.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said this to me almost sullenly. '' But you won't be believed,'' I observed; <div class="bookquote">``it's fourteen years ago. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have proofs, great proofs. I shall show them. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Then I cried and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Tell me one thing, one thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said -LRB-as though it all depended upon me-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``my wife, my children!
<p/>My wife may die of grief, and though my children won't lose their rank and property, they'll be a convict's children and for ever!
<p/>And what a memory, what a memory of me I shall leave in their hearts! ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I said nothing. '' And to part from them, to leave them for ever?
<p/>It's for ever, you know, for ever! '' I sat still and repeated a silent prayer. I got up at last, I felt afraid.
<p/>'' Well?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) looked at me. <div class="bookquote">``Go! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, ``confess. Everything passes, only the truth remains. Your children will understand, when they grow up, the nobility of your resolution.
<p/>Yet for more than a fortnight afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) came to me every evening, still preparing himself, still unable to bring himself to the point.
<p/>One day he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would come determined and say fervently: <div class="bookquote">``I know it will be heaven for me, heaven, the moment I confess.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) left me that time as though he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) made my heart ache. Fourteen years I've been in hell.
<p/>I want to suffer. I will take my punishment and begin to live. You can pass through the world doing wrong, but there's no turning back.
<p/>Now I dare not love my neighbor nor even my own children. Good God, my children will understand, perhaps, what my punishment has cost me and will not condemn me!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All will understand your sacrifice,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if not at once, they will understand later; for you have served truth, the higher truth, not of the earth.
<p/>God is not in strength but in truth. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would go away seeming comforted, but next day he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would come again, bitter, pale, sarcastic.
<p/>Every time I come to you, you look at me so inquisitively as though to say, `He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has still not confessed!'
<p/>'' Wait a bit, don't despise me too much. It's not such an easy thing to do, as you would think.
<p/>Perhaps I shall not do it at all. You won't go and inform against me then, will you? '' And far from looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with indiscreet curiosity, I was afraid to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) at all.
<p/>I was quite ill from anxiety, and my heart was full of tears. I could not sleep at night. '' I have just come from my wife,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went on.
<p/>When I went out, the children called to me, `Good-by, father, make haste back to read The Children's Magazine with us.'
<p/>'' Do you understand what the word `wife' means? No, you don't understand that! No one is wise from another man's woe.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) struck the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fist so that everything on it danced--it was the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done such a thing, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was such a mild man.
<p/>'' His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes were glittering, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips were twitching. '' But need I? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``must I? No one has been condemned, no one has been sent to Siberia in my place, the man died of fever.
<p/>And I've been punished by my sufferings for the blood I shed. And I shan't be believed, they won't believe my proofs.
<p/>I am ready to go on suffering all my life for the blood I have shed, if only my wife and children may be spared.
<p/>Need I confess, need I? Will it be just to ruin them with me? Aren't we making a mistake? What is right in this case?
<p/>And will people recognize it, will they appreciate it, will they respect it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good Lord! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought to myself, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) is thinking of other people's respect at such a moment!
<p/>And I felt so sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) then, that I believe I would have shared his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) fate if it could have comforted him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was beside himself. I was aghast, realizing with my heart as well as my mind what such a resolution meant.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Decide my fate! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) exclaimed again. <div class="bookquote">``Go and confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>). My voice failed me, but I whispered it firmly.
<p/>I took up the New Testament from the table, the Russian translation, and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) the Gospel of St. John, chapter xii.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.
<p/>verse 24: ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had just been reading that verse when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) came in. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) read it. '' That's true,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) smiled bitterly.
<p/>'' It's terrible the things you find in those books,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, after a pause. '' It's easy enough to thrust them upon one.
<p/>And who wrote them? Can they have been written by men?'' '' The Holy Spirit wrote them,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``It's easy for you to prate,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) smiled again, this time almost with hatred.
<p/>I took the book again, opened it in another place and showed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) the Epistle to the Hebrews, chapter x. verse 31.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) read: <div class="bookquote">``It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) read it and simply flung down the book.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was trembling all over. '' An awful text,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said. '' There's no denying you've picked out fitting ones. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) rose from the chair. '' Well!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``good-by, perhaps I shan't come again ... we shall meet in heaven.
<p/>So I have been for fourteen years `in the hands of the living God,' that's how one must think of those fourteen years.
<p/>I wanted to take him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in my arms and kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), but I did not dare--his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face was contorted and somber.
<p/>To-morrow I will beseech those hands to let me go. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went away. '' Good God,'' I thought, <div class="bookquote">``what has he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gone to face!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I fell on my knees before the ikon and wept for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) before the Holy Mother of God, our swift defender and helper.
<p/>I was half an hour praying in tears, and it was late, about midnight. Suddenly I saw the door open and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) came in again.
<p/>I was surprised. '' Where have you been? '' I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). '' I think,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I've forgotten something ...
<p/>my handkerchief, I think.... Well, even if I've not forgotten anything, let me stay a little. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sat down. I stood over him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>'' You sit down, too,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). I sat down. We sat still for two minutes; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) looked intently at me and suddenly smiled--
<p/>I remembered that--then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) got up, embraced me warmly and kissed me. <div class="bookquote">``Remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``how I came to you a second time.
<p/>Do you hear, remember it! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went out. '' To-morrow,'' I thought. And so it was. I did not know that evening that the next day was his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) birthday.
<p/>I had not been out for the last few days, so I had no chance of hearing it from any one.
<p/>On that day he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) always had a great gathering, every one in the town went to it. It was the same this time.
<p/>After dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) walked into the middle of the room, with a paper in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand--a formal declaration to the chief of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) department who was present.
<p/>This declaration he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) read aloud to the whole assembly. It contained a full account of the crime, in every detail. ''
<p/>I cut myself off from men as a monster. God has visited me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said in conclusion. '' I want to suffer for my sin!''
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) brought out and laid on the table all the things he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been keeping for fourteen years, that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought would prove his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) crime, the jewels belonging to the murdered woman which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had stolen to divert suspicion, a cross and a locket taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neck with a portrait of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) betrothed, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would soon be with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) unfinished answer left on the table to be sent off next day.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) carried off these two letters--what for? Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) kept them for fourteen years afterwards instead of destroying them as evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)?
<p/>And this is what happened: every one was amazed and horrified, every one refused to believe it and thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was deranged, though all listened with intense curiosity.
<p/>A few days later it was fully decided and agreed in every house that the unhappy man was mad. The legal authorities could not refuse to take the case up, but they too dropped it.
<p/>Though the trinkets and letters made them ponder, they decided that even if they did turn out to be authentic, no charge could be based on those alone.
<p/>Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) might have given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) those things as a friend, or asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to take care of them for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
<p/>I heard afterwards, however, that the genuineness of the things was proved by the friends and relations of the murdered woman, and that there was no doubt about them.
<p/>Yet nothing was destined to come of it, after all. Five days later, all had heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was ill and that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life was in danger.
<p/>But it became known that the doctors had been induced by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife to investigate his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mental condition also, and had come to the conclusion that it was a case of insanity.
<p/>The nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) illness I can't explain, they said it was an affection of the heart. I betrayed nothing, though people ran to question me.
<p/>But when I wanted to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I was for a long while forbidden to do so, above all by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.
<p/>It's you who have caused his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) illness,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said to me; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was always gloomy, but for the last year people noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was peculiarly excited and did strange things, and now you have been the ruin of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Your preaching has brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to this; for the last month he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was always with you. '' Indeed, not only his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife but the whole town were down upon me and blamed me.
<p/>I was silent and indeed rejoiced at heart, for I saw plainly God's mercy to the man who had turned against himself and punished himself.
<p/>'' It's all your doing,'' they said. I could not believe in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) insanity. They let me see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at last, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) insisted upon saying good-by to me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was weak, yellow, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands trembled, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gasped for breath, but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face was full of tender and happy feeling.
<p/>I went in to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and saw at once, that not only his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) days, but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hours were numbered. '' It is done!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. '' I've long been yearning to see you, why didn't you come? '' I did not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that they would not let me see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' God has had pity on me and is calling me to Himself. I know I am dying, but I feel joy and peace for the first time after so many years.
<p/>There was heaven in my heart from the moment I had done what I had to do. Now I dare to love my children and to kiss them.
<p/>Neither my wife nor the judges, nor any one has believed it. My children will never believe it either. I see in that God's mercy to them.
<p/>I shall die, and my name will be without a stain for them. And now I feel God near , my heart rejoices as in Heaven ...
<p/>I have done my duty. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could not speak, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gasped for breath, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pressed my hand warmly, looking fervently at me.
<p/>We did not talk for long, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife kept peeping in at us. But he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had time to whisper to me:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you remember how I came back to you that second time, at midnight? I told you to remember it. You know what I came back for?
<p/>I came to kill you! ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I started. '' I went out from you then into the darkness, I wandered about the streets, struggling with myself.
<p/>And suddenly I hated you so that I could hardly bear it. Now, I thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is all that binds me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is my judge.
<p/>It was not that I was afraid you would betray me -LRB-I never even thought of that-RRB-, but I thought, `How can I look him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in the face if I don't confess?'
<p/>And if you had been at the other end of the earth, but alive, it would have been all the same, the thought was unendurable that you were alive knowing everything and condemning me.
<p/>I can't refuse to face my punishment to-morrow, for he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knows all. I hated you as though you were the cause, as though you were to blame for everything.
<p/>I came back to you then, remembering that you had a dagger lying on your table. I sat down and asked you to sit down, and for a whole minute I pondered.
<p/>If I had killed you, I should have been ruined by that murder even if I had not confessed the other.
<p/>But I didn't think about that at all, and I didn't want to think of it at that moment. I only hated you and longed to revenge myself on you for everything.
<p/>The Lord vanquished the devil in my heart. But let me tell you, you were never nearer death. '' A week later he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) died.
<p/>The whole town followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to the grave. The chief priest made a speech full of feeling. All lamented the terrible illness that had cut short his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) days.
<p/>Some, at first a few and afterwards more, began indeed to believe in the truth of his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) story, and they visited me and questioned me with great interest and eagerness, for man loves to see the downfall and disgrace of the righteous.
<p/>But all the town was up in arms against me after the funeral, and people even refused to see me. But I held my tongue, and very shortly after, I left the town, and five months later by God's grace
<p/>I entered upon the safe and blessed path, praising the unseen finger which had guided me so clearly to it. But I remember in my prayer to this day, the servant of God, Mihail, who suffered so greatly.
<p/>Chapter III. Conversations And Exhortations Of Father Zossima -LRB-e-RRB- The Russian Monk and his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) possible Significance Fathers and teachers, what is the monk?
<p/>In the cultivated world the word is nowadays pronounced by some people with a jeer, and by others it is used as a term of abuse, and this contempt for the monk is growing.
<p/>Educated people point to these: <div class="bookquote">``You are idlers, useless members of society, you live on the labor of others, you are shameless beggars.
<p/>It is true, alas, it is true, that there are many sluggards, gluttons, profligates and insolent beggars among monks. ''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>And yet how many meek and humble monks there are, yearning for solitude and fervent prayer in peace!
<p/>And how surprised men would be if I were to say that from these meek monks, who yearn for solitary prayer, the salvation of Russia will come perhaps once more!
<p/>For they are in truth made ready in peace and quiet <div class="bookquote">``for the day and the hour, the month and the year.
<p/>Meanwhile, in their solitude, they keep the image of Christ fair and undefiled, in the purity of God's truth, from the times of the Fathers of old, the Apostles and the martyrs.
<p/>These are less noticed, or passed over in silence. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And when the time comes they will show it to the tottering creeds of the world.
<p/>That is a great thought. That star will rise out of the East. That is my view of the monk, and is it false?
<p/>Look at the worldly and all who set themselves up above the people of God, has not God's image and His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) truth been distorted in them?
<p/>The spiritual world, the higher part of man's being is rejected altogether, dismissed with a sort of triumph, even with hatred.
<p/>The world has proclaimed the reign of freedom, especially of late, but what do we see in this freedom of theirs?
<p/>is it too proud? They have science; but in science there is nothing but what is the object of sense. Nothing but slavery and self-destruction!
<p/>For the world says: <div class="bookquote">``You have desires and so satisfy them, for you have the same rights as the most rich and powerful.
<p/>Don't be afraid of satisfying them and even multiply your desires. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That is the modern doctrine of the world. In that they see freedom.
<p/>In the rich, isolation and spiritual suicide; in the poor, envy and murder; for they have been given rights, but have not been shown the means of satisfying their wants.
<p/>They maintain that the world is getting more and more united, more and more bound together in brotherly community, as it overcomes distance and sets thoughts flying through the air.
<p/>Interpreting freedom as the multiplication and rapid satisfaction of desires, men distort their own nature, for many senseless and foolish desires and habits and ridiculous fancies are fostered in them.
<p/>And what follows from this right of multiplication of desires? Alas, put no faith in such a bond of union. They live only for mutual envy, for luxury and ostentation.
<p/>To have dinners, visits, carriages, rank and slaves to wait on one is looked upon as a necessity, for which life, honor and human feeling are sacrificed, and men even commit suicide if they are unable to satisfy it.
<p/>We see the same thing among those who are not rich, while the poor drown their unsatisfied need and their envy in drunkenness.
<p/>But soon they will drink blood instead of wine, they are being led on to it. I ask you is such a man free?
<p/>I knew one <div class="bookquote">``champion of freedom''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>who told me himself that, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was deprived of tobacco in prison, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so wretched at the privation that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) almost went and betrayed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cause for the sake of getting tobacco again!
<p/>And such a man says, <div class="bookquote">``I am fighting for the cause of humanity. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>How can such a one fight? what is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fit for?
<p/>And it's no wonder that instead of gaining freedom they have sunk into slavery, and instead of serving the cause of brotherly love and the union of humanity have fallen, on the contrary, into dissension and isolation, as my mysterious visitor and teacher said to me in my youth.
<p/>And therefore the idea of the service of humanity, of brotherly love and the solidarity of mankind, is more and more dying out in the world, and indeed this idea is sometimes treated with derision.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) is capable perhaps of some action quickly over, but he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) cannot hold out long. For how can a man shake off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) habits?
<p/>What can become of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is in such bondage to the habit of satisfying the innumerable desires he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has created for himself?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is isolated, and what concern has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with the rest of humanity? They have succeeded in accumulating a greater mass of objects, but the joy in the world has grown less.
<p/>The monastic way is very different. Obedience, fasting and prayer are laughed at, yet only through them lies the way to real, true freedom.
<p/>I cut off my superfluous and unnecessary desires, I subdue my proud and wanton will and chastise it with obedience, and with God's help I attain freedom of spirit and with it spiritual joy.
<p/>Which is most capable of conceiving a great idea and serving it--the rich man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) isolation or the man who has freed himself from the tyranny of material things and habits?
<p/>The monk is reproached for his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) solitude, <div class="bookquote">``You have secluded yourself within the walls of the monastery for your own salvation, and have forgotten the brotherly service of humanity!''
 (<font color='red'><b>The monk</b></font>)</div><p/>But we shall see which will be most zealous in the cause of brotherly love. For it is not we, but
<p/>they, who are in isolation, though they don't see that. Of old, leaders of the people came from among us, and why should they not again?
<p/>The same meek and humble ascetics will rise up and go out to work for the great cause. The salvation of Russia comes from the people.
<p/>And the Russian monk has always been on the side of the people. We are isolated only if the people are isolated.
<p/>The people believe as we do, and an unbelieving reformer will never do anything in Russia, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>reformer</b></font>) is sincere in heart and a genius.
<p/>Remember that! The people will meet the atheist and overcome him (<font color='blue'><b>atheist</b></font>), and Russia will be one and orthodox. Take care of the peasant and guard his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) heart.
<p/>-LRB- f -RRB- Of Masters and Servants, and of whether it is possible for them to be Brothers in the Spirit
<p/>Go on educating him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) quietly. That's your duty as monks, for the peasant has God in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heart. Of course, I don't deny that there is sin in the peasants too.
<p/>And the fire of corruption is spreading visibly, hourly, working from above downwards. The spirit of isolation is coming upon the people too.
<p/>Already the merchant grows more and more eager for rank, and strives to show himself cultured though he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) has not a trace of culture, and to this end meanly despises his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) old traditions, and is even ashamed of the faith of his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) fathers.
<p/>Money- lenders and devourers of the commune are rising up. He (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) visits princes, though he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) is only a peasant corrupted. The peasants are rotting in drunkenness and cannot shake off the habit.
<p/>And what cruelty to their wives, to their children even! All from drunkenness! I've seen in the factories children of nine years old, frail, rickety, bent and already depraved.
<p/>The stuffy workshop, the din of machinery, work all day long, the vile language and the drink, the drink--is that what a little child's heart needs?
<p/>There must be no more of this, monks, no more torturing of children, rise up and preach that, make haste, make haste!
<p/>But God will save Russia, for though the peasants are corrupted and cannot renounce their filthy sin, yet they know it is cursed by God and that they do wrong in sinning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) needs sunshine, childish play, good examples all about him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and at least a little love. So that our people still believe in righteousness, have faith in God and weep tears of devotion.
<p/>They, following science, want to base justice on reason alone, but not with Christ, as before, and they have already proclaimed that there is no crime, that there is no sin.
<p/>It is different with the upper classes. And that's consistent, for if you have no God what is the meaning of crime?
<p/>In Europe the people are already rising up against the rich with violence, and the leaders of the people are everywhere leading them to bloodshed, and teaching them that their wrath is righteous.
<p/>But their <div class="bookquote">``wrath is accursed, for it is cruel. ''  (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>But God will save Russia as He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has saved her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) many times.
<p/>Salvation will come from the people, from their faith and their meekness. Fathers and teachers, watch over the people's faith and this will not be a dream.
<p/>I've seen it myself, I can testify to it, I've seen it and marveled at it, I've seen it in spite of the degraded sins and poverty-stricken appearance of our peasantry.
<p/>They are not servile, and even after two centuries of serfdom they are free in manner and bearing, yet without insolence, and not revengeful and not envious.
<p/>I've been struck all my life in our great people by their dignity, their true and seemly dignity. '' You are rich and noble, you are clever and talented, well, be so, God bless you.
<p/>I respect you, but I know that I too am a man. By the very fact that I respect you without envy I prove my dignity as a man.
<p/>In truth if they don't say this -LRB-for they don't know how to say this yet-RRB-, that is how they act.
<p/>I have seen it myself, I have known it myself, and, would you believe it, the poorer our Russian peasant is, the more noticeable is that serene goodness, for the rich among them are for the most part corrupted already, and much of that is due to our carelessness and indifference.
<p/>'' But God will save His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) people, for Russia is great in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) humility. I dream of seeing, and seem to see clearly already, our future.
<p/>It will come to pass, that even the most corrupt of our rich will end by being ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) riches before the poor, and the poor, seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) humility, will understand and give way before him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), will respond joyfully and kindly to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) honorable shame.
<p/>Believe me that it will end in that; things are moving to that. Equality is to be found only in the spiritual dignity of man, and that will only be understood among us.
<p/>If we were brothers, there would be fraternity, but before that, they will never agree about the division of wealth. We preserve the image of Christ, and it will shine forth like a precious diamond to the whole world.
<p/>So may it be, so may it be! Fathers and teachers, a touching incident befell me once. In my wanderings I met in the town of K. my old orderly, Afanasy.
<p/>It was eight years since I had parted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) chanced to see me in the market-place, recognized me, ran up to me, and how delighted he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) simply pounced on me: <div class="bookquote">``Master dear, is it you? Is it really you I see? ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) took me home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) was no longer in the army, he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) was married and already had two little children. He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) wife earned their living as costermongers in the market-place.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) made me sit down, set the samovar, sent for his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) wife, as though my appearance were a festival for them.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) room was poor, but bright and clean. He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) brought me his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) children: <div class="bookquote">``Bless them, Father.''  (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is it for me to bless them?
<p/>And for you, Afanasy Pavlovitch, I have prayed every day since that day, for it all came from you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.
<p/>I am only a humble monk. I will pray for them. And I explained that to him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) as well as I could.
<p/>The man kept gazing at me and could not believe that I, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) former master, an officer, was now before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in such a guise and position; it made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shed tears.
<p/>'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``better rejoice over me, dear friend, whom I can never forget, for my path is a glad and joyful one.
<p/>And what do you think? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Why are you weeping? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did not say much, but kept sighing and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) head over me tenderly.
<p/>'' What has became of your fortune?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) asked. '' I gave it to the monastery,'' I answered; ``we live in common.
<p/>After tea I began saying good-by, and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) brought out half a rouble as an offering to the monastery, and another half-rouble
<p/>I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thrusting hurriedly into my hand: ``That's for you in your wanderings, it may be of use to you, Father.
<p/>And on my way I thought: <div class="bookquote">``Here we are both now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) at home and I on the road, sighing and shaking our heads, no doubt, and yet smiling joyfully in the gladness of our hearts, remembering how God brought about our meeting.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I took his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) half-rouble, bowed to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife, and went out rejoicing. '' I have never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) again since then.
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) my servant, but now when we exchanged a loving kiss with softened hearts, there was a great human bond between us.
<p/>I have thought a great deal about that, and now what I think is this: Is it so inconceivable that that grand and simple-hearted unity might in due time become universal among the Russian people?
<p/>I had been his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) master I believe that it will come to pass and that the time is at hand. And of servants I will add this: In old days when I was young
<p/>I was often angry with servants; <div class="bookquote">``the cook had served something too hot, the orderly had not brushed my clothes. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>servants</b></font>)</div><p/>But what taught me better then was a thought of my dear brother's, which I had heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in childhood:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Am I worth it, that another should serve me and be ordered about by me in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) poverty and ignorance? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>And I wondered at the time that such simple and self- evident ideas should be so slow to occur to our minds.
<p/>It is impossible that there should be no servants in the world, but act so that your servant may be freer in spirit than if he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) were not a servant.
<p/>And why cannot I be a servant to my servant and even let him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) see it, and that without any pride on my part or any mistrust on his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)?
<p/>Why should not my servant be like my own kindred, so that I may take him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) into my family and rejoice in doing so?
<p/>Even now this can be done, but it will lead to the grand unity of men in the future, when a man will not seek servants for himself, or desire to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fellow creatures into servants as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does now, but on the contrary, will long with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole heart to be the servant of all, as the Gospel teaches.
<p/>And can it be a dream, that in the end man will find his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) joy only in deeds of light and mercy, and not in cruel pleasures as now, in gluttony, fornication, ostentation, boasting and envious rivalry of one with the other?
<p/>I firmly believe that it is not and that the time is at hand. People laugh and ask: <div class="bookquote">``When will that time come and does it look like coming?
<p/>And how many ideas there have been on earth in the history of man which were unthinkable ten years before they appeared!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>People</b></font>)</div>I believe that with Christ's help we shall accomplish this great thing. Yet when their destined hour had come, they came forth and spread over the whole earth.
<p/>So it will be with us, and our people will shine forth in the world, and all men will say: <div class="bookquote">``The stone which the builders rejected has become the corner-stone of the building.
<p/>And we may ask the scornful themselves: If our hope is a dream, when will you build up your edifice and order things justly by your intellect alone, without Christ?
<p/>If they declare that it is they who are advancing towards unity, only the most simple-hearted among them believe it, so that one may positively marvel at such simplicity.
<p/>They aim at justice, but, denying Christ, they will end by flooding the earth with blood, for blood cries out for blood, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) that taketh up the sword shall perish by the sword.
<p/>And if it were not for Christ's covenant, they would slaughter one another down to the last two men on earth.
<p/>And those two last men would not be able to restrain each other in their pride, and the one would slay the other and then himself.
<p/>And that would come to pass, were it not for the promise of Christ that for the sake of the humble and meek the days shall be shortened.
<p/>While I was still wearing an officer's uniform after my duel, I talked about servants in general society, and I remember every one was amazed at me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>all men</b></font>)</div>Of a truth, they have more fantastic dreams than we. <div class="bookquote">``What! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they asked, <div class="bookquote">``are we to make our servants sit down on the sofa and offer them tea?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And I answered them: <div class="bookquote">``Why not, sometimes at least? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Every one laughed. Their question was frivolous and my answer was not clear; but the thought in it was to some extent right.
<p/>Every time you pray, if your prayer is sincere, there will be new feeling and new meaning in it, which will give you fresh courage, and you will understand that prayer is an education.
<p/>Remember, too, every day, and whenever you can, repeat to yourself, <div class="bookquote">``Lord, have mercy on all who appear before Thee to-day.
<p/>-LRB- g -RRB- Of Prayer, of Love, and of Contact with other Worlds Young man, be not forgetful of prayer. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And how many of them depart in solitude, unknown, sad, dejected that no one mourns for them or even knows whether they have lived or not!
<p/>And behold, from the other end of the earth perhaps, your prayer for their rest will rise up to God though you knew them not nor they you.
<p/>How touching it must be to a soul standing in dread before the Lord to feel at that instant that, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) too, there is one to pray, that there is a fellow creature left on earth to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) too!
<p/>And God will look on you both more graciously, for if you have had so much pity on him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), how much will He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) have pity Who is infinitely more loving and merciful than you!
<p/>For every hour and every moment thousands of men leave life on this earth, and their souls appear before God. And He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) for your sake.
<p/>Love a man even in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sin, for that is the semblance of Divine Love and is the highest love on earth.
<p/>Brothers, have no fear of men's sin. Love all God's creation, the whole and every grain of sand in it. Love every leaf, every ray of God's light.
<p/>Love the animals, love the plants, love everything. If you love everything, you will perceive the divine mystery in things. Once you perceive it, you will begin to comprehend it better every day.
<p/>And you will come at last to love the whole world with an all- embracing love. Love the animals: God has given them the rudiments of thought and joy untroubled.
<p/>Man, do not pride yourself on superiority to the animals; they are without sin, and you, with your greatness, defile the earth by your appearance on it, and leave the traces of your foulness after you--alas
<p/>Do not trouble it, don't harass them, don't deprive them of their happiness, don't work against God's intent. , it is true of almost every one of us!
<p/>Love children especially, for they too are sinless like the angels; they live to soften and purify our hearts and as it were to guide us.
<p/>The kind, silent man used often on our wanderings to spend the farthings given us on sweets and cakes for the children.
<p/>Woe to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who offends a child! Father Anfim taught me to love children. He (<font color='blue'><b>Anfim</b></font>) could not pass by a child without emotion.
<p/>At some thoughts one stands perplexed, especially at the sight of men's sin, and wonders whether one should use force or humble love.
<p/>That's the nature of the man. Always decide to use humble love. If you resolve on that once for all, you may subdue the whole world.
<p/>Every day and every hour, every minute, walk round yourself and watch yourself, and see that your image is a seemly one.
<p/>You pass by a little child, you pass by, spiteful, with ugly words, with wrathful heart; you may not have noticed the child, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has seen you, and your image, unseemly and ignoble, may remain in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) defenseless heart.
<p/>Loving humility is marvelously strong, the strongest of all things, and there is nothing else like it. You don't know it, but you may have sown an evil seed in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and it may grow, and
<p/>all because you were not careful before the child, because you did not foster in yourself a careful, actively benevolent love.
<p/>Brothers, love is a teacher; but one must know how to acquire it, for it is hard to acquire, it is dearly bought, it is won slowly by long labor.
<p/>For we must love not only occasionally, for a moment, but for ever. Every one can love occasionally, even the wicked can.
<p/>My brother asked the birds to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>); that sounds senseless, but it is right; for all is like an ocean, all is flowing and blending; a touch in one place sets up movement at the other end of the earth.
<p/>It may be senseless to beg forgiveness of the birds, but birds would be happier at your side--a little happier, anyway--and children and all animals, if you were nobler than you are now.
<p/>Then you would pray to the birds too, consumed by an all-embracing love, in a sort of transport, and pray that they too will forgive you your sin.
<p/>It's all like an ocean, I tell you. Treasure this ecstasy, however senseless it may seem to men. My friends, pray to God for gladness.
<p/>Be glad as children, as the birds of heaven. And let not the sin of men confound you in your doings.
<p/>Do not say, <div class="bookquote">``Sin is mighty, wickedness is mighty, evil environment is mighty, and we are lonely and helpless, and evil environment is wearing us away and hindering our good work from being done.
<p/>There is only one means of salvation, then take yourself and make yourself responsible for all men's sins, that is the truth, you know, friends, for as soon as you sincerely make yourself responsible for everything and for all men, you will see at once that it is really so, and that you are to blame for every one and for all things.
<p/>But throwing your own indolence and impotence on others you will end by sharing the pride of Satan and murmuring against God.
<p/>Of the pride of Satan what I think is this: it is hard for us on earth to comprehend it, and therefore it is so easy to fall into error and to share it, even imagining that we are doing something grand and fine.
<p/>Fear not that it will wear away your work and hinder its being accomplished. ''  (<font color='red'><b>that dejection children</b></font>)</div>Fly from that dejection, children! Indeed, many of the strongest feelings and movements of our nature we cannot comprehend on earth.
<p/>Let not that be a stumbling-block, and think not that it may serve as a justification to you for anything. For the Eternal Judge asks of you what you can comprehend and not what you cannot.
<p/>On earth, indeed, we are as it were astray, and if it were not for the precious image of Christ before us, we should be undone and altogether lost, as was the human race before the flood.
<p/>Much on earth is hidden from us, but to make up for that we have been given a precious mystic sense of our living bond with the other world, with the higher heavenly world, and the roots of our thoughts and feelings are not here but in other worlds.
<p/>You will know that yourself hereafter, for you will behold all things truly then and will not dispute them. That is why the philosophers say that we cannot apprehend the reality of things on earth.
<p/>God took seeds from different worlds and sowed them on this earth, and His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) garden grew up and everything came up that could come up, but what grows lives and is alive only through the feeling of its contact with other mysterious worlds.
<p/>If that feeling grows weak or is destroyed in you, the heavenly growth will die away in you. Then you will be indifferent to life and even grow to hate it.
<p/>That's what I think. -LRB-h-RRB- Can a Man judge his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) Fellow Creatures? Faith to the End Remember particularly that you cannot be a judge of any one.
<p/>For no one can judge a criminal, until he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) recognizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) is just such a criminal as the man standing before him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) perhaps is more than all men to blame for that crime.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) understands that, he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) will be able to be a judge. Though that sounds absurd, it is true. If I had been righteous myself, perhaps there would have been no criminal standing before me.
<p/>If you can take upon yourself the crime of the criminal your heart is judging, take it at once, suffer for him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) yourself, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) go without reproach.
<p/>And even if the law itself makes you his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) judge, act in the same spirit so far as possible, for he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) will go away and condemn himself more bitterly than you have done.
<p/>If, after your kiss, he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) goes away untouched, mocking at you, do not let that be a stumbling-block to you. It shows his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) time has not yet come, but it will come in due course.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>), then another in his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) place will understand and suffer, and judge and condemn himself, and the truth will be fulfilled.
<p/>And if it come not, no matter; if not Believe that, believe it without doubt; for in that lies all the hope and faith of the saints.
<p/>If you remember in the night as you go to sleep, <div class="bookquote">``I have not done what I ought to have done,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>rise up at once and do it.
<p/>If the people around you are spiteful and callous and will not hear you, fall down before them and beg their forgiveness; for in truth you are to blame for their not wanting to hear you.
<p/>Work without ceasing. And if you cannot speak to them in their bitterness, serve them in silence and in humility, never losing hope.
<p/>If all men abandon you and even drive you away by force, then when you are left alone fall on the earth and kiss it, water it with your tears and it will bring forth fruit even though no one has seen or heard you in your solitude.
<p/>Believe to the end, even if all men went astray and you were left the only one faithful; bring your offering even then and praise God in your loneliness.
<p/>And if two of you are gathered together--then there is a whole world, a world of living love. Embrace each other tenderly and praise God, for if only in you two His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) truth has been fulfilled.
<p/>If you sin yourself and grieve even unto death for your sins or for your sudden sin, then rejoice for others, rejoice for the righteous man, rejoice that if you have sinned, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is righteous and has not sinned.
<p/>If the evil-doing of men moves you to indignation and overwhelming distress, even to a desire for vengeance on the evil-doers, shun above all things that feeling.
<p/>Accept that suffering and bear it and your heart will find comfort, and you will understand that you too are guilty, for you might have been a light to the evil-doers, even as the one man sinless, and you were not a light to them.
<p/>If you had been a light, you would have lightened the path for others too, and the evil-doer might perhaps have been saved by your light from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sin.
<p/>And even though your light was shining, yet you see men were not saved by it, hold firm and doubt not the power of the heavenly light.
<p/>Go at once and seek suffering for yourself, as though you were yourself guilty of that wrong. Believe that if they were not saved, they will be saved hereafter.
<p/>And if they are not saved hereafter, then their sons will be saved, for your light will not die even when you are dead.
<p/>The righteous man departs, but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) light remains. Men are always saved after the death of the deliverer. Men reject their prophets and slay them, but they love their martyrs and honor those whom they have slain.
<p/>Seek no reward, for great is your reward on this earth: the spiritual joy which is only vouchsafed to the righteous man.
<p/>You are working for the whole, you are acting for the future. Fear not the great nor the mighty, but be wise and ever serene.
<p/>Know the measure , know the times, study that. When you are left alone, pray. Love to throw yourself on the earth and kiss it.
<p/>Kiss the earth and love it with an unceasing, consuming love. Love all men, love everything. Seek that rapture and ecstasy.
<p/>Don't be ashamed of that ecstasy, prize it, for it is a gift of God and a great one; it is not given to many but only to the elect.
<p/>Water the earth with the tears of your joy and love those tears. -LRB-i-RRB- Of Hell and Hell Fire, a Mystic Reflection Fathers and teachers
<p/>Once in infinite existence, immeasurable in time and space, a spiritual creature was given on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) coming to earth, the power of saying, ``I am and I love.
<p/>Once, only once, there was given him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) a moment of active living love, and for that was earthly life given him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and with it times and seasons.
<p/>, I ponder, <div class="bookquote">``What is hell? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I maintain that it is the suffering of being unable to love. '' And that happy creature rejected the priceless gift, prized it and loved it not, scorned it and remained callous.
<p/>Such a one, having left the earth, sees Abraham's bosom and talks with Abraham as we are told in the parable of the rich man and Lazarus, and beholds heaven and can go up to the Lord.
<p/>But that is just his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) torment, to rise up to the Lord without ever having loved, to be brought close to those who have loved when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) has despised their love.
<p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) sees clearly and says to himself, <div class="bookquote">``Now I have understanding, and though I now thirst to love, there will be nothing great, no sacrifice in my love, for my earthly life is over, and Abraham will not come even with a drop of living water -LRB-that is the gift of earthly active life-RRB- to cool the fiery thirst of spiritual love which burns in me now, though I despised it on earth; there is no more life for me and will be no more time!
<p/>Even though I would gladly give my life for others, it can never be, for that life is passed which can be sacrificed for love, and now there is a gulf fixed between that life and this existence.
<p/>But I think if there were fire in material sense, they would be glad of it, for I imagine that in material agony, their still greater spiritual agony would be forgotten for a moment.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They talk of hell fire in the material sense. I don't go into that mystery and I shun it. Moreover, that spiritual agony cannot be taken from them, for that suffering is not external but within them.
<p/>For even if the righteous in Paradise forgave them, beholding their torments, and called them up to heaven in their infinite love, they would only multiply their torments, for they would arouse in them still more keenly a flaming thirst for responsive, active and grateful love which is now impossible.
<p/>In the timidity of my heart I imagine, however, that the very recognition of this impossibility would serve at last to console them.
<p/>For accepting the love of the righteous together with the impossibility of repaying it, by this submissiveness and the effect of this humility, they will attain at last, as it were, to a certain semblance of that active love which they scorned in life, to something like its outward expression....
<p/>And if it could be taken from them, I think it would be bitterer still for the unhappy creatures. I am sorry, friends and brothers, that I cannot express this clearly.
<p/>But woe to those who have slain themselves on earth, woe to the suicides! I believe that there can be none more miserable then they.
<p/>They tell us that it is a sin to pray for them and outwardly the Church, as it were, renounces them, but in my secret heart I believe that we may pray even for them.
<p/>For such as those I have prayed inwardly all my life, I confess it, fathers and teachers, and even now I pray for them every day.
<p/>Oh, there are some who remain proud and fierce even in hell, in spite of their certain knowledge and contemplation of the absolute truth; there are some fearful ones who have given themselves over to Satan and his (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) proud spirit entirely.
<p/>Love can never be an offense to Christ. For such, hell is voluntary and ever consuming; they are tortured by their own choice.
<p/>For they have cursed themselves, cursing God and life. They live upon their vindictive pride like a starving man in the desert sucking blood out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own body.
<p/>They cannot behold the living God without hatred, and they cry out that the God of life should be annihilated, that God should destroy Himself and His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own creation.
<p/>But they are never satisfied, and they refuse forgiveness, they curse God Who calls them. And they will burn in the fire of their own wrath for ever and yearn for death and annihilation.
<p/>But they will not attain to death... ------------------------------------- Here Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov's manuscript ends. I repeat, it is incomplete and fragmentary.
<p/>Biographical details, for instance, cover only Father Zossima's earliest youth. Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) teaching and opinions we find brought together sayings evidently uttered on very different occasions.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) utterances during the last few hours have not been kept separate from the rest, but their general character can be gathered from what we have in Alexey Fyodorovitch's manuscript.
<p/>For although those who were gathered about him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) that last evening realized that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) death was approaching, yet it was difficult to imagine that it would come so suddenly.
<p/>On the contrary, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) friends, as I observed already, seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) that night apparently so cheerful and talkative, were convinced that there was at least a temporary change for the better in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) condition.
<p/>The elder's death came in the end quite unexpectedly. Even five minutes before his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) death, they said afterwards wonderingly, it was impossible to foresee it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) seemed suddenly to feel an acute pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) chest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) turned pale and pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) hands to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) heart.
<p/>But though suffering, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) still looked at them with a smile, sank slowly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) chair on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) knees, then bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) face to the ground, stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) arms and as though in joyful ecstasy, praying and kissing the ground, quietly and joyfully gave up his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) soul to God.
<p/>All rose from their seats and hastened to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). The news of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) death spread at once through the hermitage and reached the monastery.
<p/>The nearest friends of the deceased and those whose duty it was from their position began to lay out the corpse according to the ancient ritual, and all the monks gathered together in the church.
<p/>By the morning all the town was talking of the event, and crowds were flocking from the town to the monastery.
<p/>But this subject will be treated in the next book; I will only add here that before a day had passed something happened so unexpected, so strange, upsetting, and bewildering in its effect on the monks and the townspeople, that after all these years, that day of general suspense is still vividly remembered in the town.
<p/>And before dawn the news of the death reached the town. PART III Book VII. Alyosha Chapter I. The Breath Of Corruption
<p/>The body of Father Zossima was prepared for burial according to the established ritual. As is well known, the bodies of dead monks and hermits are not washed.
<p/>In the words of the Church Ritual: <div class="bookquote">``If any one of the monks depart in the Lord, the monk designated -LRB-that is, whose office it is-RRB- shall wipe the body with warm water, making first the sign of the cross with a sponge on the forehead of the deceased, on the breast, on the hands and feet and on the knees, and that is enough.
<p/>All this was done by Father Paďssy, who then clothed the deceased in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) monastic garb and wrapped him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) cloak, which was, according to custom, somewhat slit to allow of its being folded about him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) in the form of a cross.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) head he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) put a hood with an eight-cornered cross. The hood was left open and the dead man's face was covered with black gauze.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) hands was put an ikon of the Saviour. Towards morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) was put in the coffin which had been made ready long before.
<p/>It was decided to leave the coffin all day in the cell, in the larger room in which the elder used to receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) visitors and fellow monks.
<p/>As the deceased was a priest and monk of the strictest rule, the Gospel, not the Psalter, had to be read over his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) body by monks in holy orders.
<p/>Father Paďssy desired later on to read the Gospel all day and night over his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) dead friend, but for the present he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), as well as the Father Superintendent of the Hermitage, was very busy and occupied, for something extraordinary, an unheard-of, even <div class="bookquote">``unseemly''  (<font color='red'><b>the Father Superintendent</b></font>)</div>excitement and impatient expectation began to be apparent in the monks, and the visitors from the monastery hostels, and the crowds of people flocking from the town.
<p/>The reading was begun by Father Iosif immediately after the requiem service. And as time went on, this grew more and more marked.
<p/>When it was fully daylight, some people began bringing their sick, in most cases children, with them from the town--as though they had been waiting expressly for this moment to do so, evidently persuaded that the dead elder's remains had a power of healing, which would be immediately made manifest in accordance with their faith.
<p/>It was only then apparent how unquestionably every one in our town had accepted Father Zossima during his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) lifetime as a great saint.
<p/>Both the Superintendent and Father Paďssy did their utmost to calm the general bustle and agitation. And those who came were far from being all of the humbler classes.
<p/>This intense expectation on the part of believers displayed with such haste, such openness, even with impatience and almost insistence, impressed Father Paďssy as unseemly.
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had long foreseen something of the sort, the actual manifestation of the feeling was beyond anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had looked for.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) came across any of the monks who displayed this excitement, Father Paďssy began to reprove them. '' Such immediate expectation of something extraordinary,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``shows a levity, possible to worldly people but unseemly in us.
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) himself -LRB-if the whole truth must be told-RRB-, secretly at the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) heart, cherished almost the same hopes and could not but be aware of it, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) was indignant at the too impatient expectation around him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>), and saw in it light-mindedness and vanity.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But little attention was paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) and Father Paďssy noticed it uneasily. Nevertheless, it was particularly unpleasant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) to meet certain persons, whose presence aroused in him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) great misgivings.
<p/>In the crowd in the dead man's cell he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) noticed with inward aversion -LRB-for which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) immediately reproached himself-RRB- the presence of Rakitin and of the monk from Obdorsk, who was still staying in the monastery.
<p/>Of both of them Father Paďssy felt for some reason suddenly suspicious--though, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) might well have felt the same about others.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was to be seen everywhere; everywhere he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was asking questions, everywhere he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was listening, on all sides he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was whispering with a peculiar, mysterious air.
<p/>The monk from Obdorsk was conspicuous as the most fussy in the excited crowd. His (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) expression showed the greatest impatience and even a sort of irritation.
<p/>As for Rakitin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>), as appeared later, had come so early to the hermitage at the special request of Madame Hohlakov.
<p/>As soon as that good-hearted but weak-minded woman, who could not herself have been admitted to the hermitage, waked and heard of the death of Father Zossima, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was overtaken with such intense curiosity that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) promptly dispatched Rakitin to the hermitage, to keep a careful look out and report to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by letter every half-hour or so '' everything that takes place .
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was particularly clever in getting round people and assuming whatever part he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) thought most to their taste, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) detected the slightest advantage to himself from doing so.
<p/>It was a bright, clear day, and many of the visitors were thronging about the tombs, which were particularly numerous round the church and scattered here and there about the hermitage.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) walked round the hermitage, Father Paďssy remembered Alyosha and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) for some time, not since the night.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) had no sooner thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) at once noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) in the farthest corner of the hermitage garden, sitting on the tombstone of a monk who had been famous long ago for his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) saintliness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) back to the hermitage and his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) face to the wall, and seemed to be hiding behind the tombstone.
<p/>Going up to him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>), Father Paďssy saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) was weeping quietly but bitterly, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) face hidden in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) hands, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) whole frame was shaking with sobs.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) regarded Rakitin as a most religious and devout young man. Father Paďssy stood over him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) for a little. ''
<p/>Enough, dear son, enough, dear,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) pronounced with feeling at last. '' Why do you weep? Rejoice and weep not. Don't you know that this is the greatest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) days?
<p/>Alyosha glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>), uncovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) face, which was swollen with crying like a child's, but turned away at once without uttering a word and hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) hands again.
<p/>Think only where he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) is now, at this moment!'' '' Maybe it is well,'' said Father Paďssy thoughtfully; <div class="bookquote">``weep if you must, Christ has sent you those tears.
<p/>Your touching tears are but a relief to your spirit and will serve to gladden your dear heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Paďssy/Father Paďssy</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) added to himself, walking away from Alyosha, and thinking lovingly of him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>).
<p/>'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) moved away quickly, however, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) too might weep looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>). Meanwhile the time was passing; the monastery services and the requiems for the dead followed in their due course.
<p/>But before three o'clock in the afternoon that something took place to which I alluded at the end of the last book, something so unexpected by all of us and so contrary to the general hope, that, I repeat, this trivial incident has been minutely remembered to this day in our town and all the surrounding neighborhood.
<p/>I may add here, for myself personally, that I feel it almost repulsive to recall that event which caused such frivolous agitation and was such a stumbling-block to many, though in reality it was the most natural and trivial matter.
<p/>I should, of course, have omitted all mention of it in my story, if it had not exerted a very strong influence on the heart and soul of the chief, though future, hero of my story, Alyosha, forming a crisis and turning-point in his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) spiritual development, giving a shock to his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) intellect, which finally strengthened it for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) life and gave it a definite aim.
<p/>Father Paďssy again took Father Iosif's place by the coffin and began reading the Gospel. And so, to return to our story.
<p/>When before dawn they laid Father Zossima's body in the coffin and brought it into the front room, the question of opening the windows was raised among those who were around the coffin.
<p/>Some of those present may perhaps have inwardly noticed it, only to reflect that the anticipation of decay and corruption from the body of such a saint was an actual absurdity, calling for compassion -LRB-if not a smile-RRB- for the lack of faith and the frivolity it implied.
<p/>And, behold, soon after midday there were signs of something, at first only observed in silence by those who came in and out and were evidently each afraid to communicate the thought in his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) mind.
<p/>But by three o'clock those signs had become so clear and unmistakable, that the news swiftly reached all the monks and visitors in the hermitage, promptly penetrated to the monastery, throwing all the monks into amazement, and finally, in the shortest possible time, spread to the town, exciting every one in it, believers and unbelievers alike.
<p/>The unbelievers rejoiced, and as for the believers some of them rejoiced even more than the unbelievers, for <div class="bookquote">``men love the downfall and disgrace of the righteous,''  (<font color='red'><b>the unbelievers</b></font>)</div>as the deceased elder had said in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>monks</b></font>) exhortations.
<p/>The fact is that a smell of decomposition began to come from the coffin, growing gradually more marked, and by three o'clock it was quite unmistakable.
<p/>In all the past history of our monastery, no such scandal could be recalled, and in no other circumstances could such a scandal have been possible, as showed itself in unseemly disorder immediately after this discovery among the very monks themselves.
<p/>Afterwards, even many years afterwards, some sensible monks were amazed and horrified, when they recalled that day, that the scandal could have reached such proportions.
<p/>For in the past, monks of very holy life had died, God-fearing old men, whose saintliness was acknowledged by all, yet from their humble coffins, too, the breath of corruption had come, naturally, as from all dead bodies, but that had caused no scandal nor even the slightest excitement.
<p/>Of course there had been, in former times, saints in the monastery whose memory was carefully preserved and whose relics, according to tradition, showed no signs of corruption.
<p/>This fact was regarded by the monks as touching and mysterious, and the tradition of it was cherished as something blessed and miraculous, and as a promise, by God's grace, of still greater glory from their tombs in the future.
<p/>One such, whose memory was particularly cherished, was an old monk, Job, who had died seventy years before at the age of a hundred and five.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) had been a celebrated ascetic, rigid in fasting and silence, and his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) tomb was pointed out to all visitors on their arrival with peculiar respect and mysterious hints of great hopes connected with it.
<p/>But this suggestion made casually by some one was unanswered and almost unnoticed. For they expected something quite different. -LRB-That was the very tomb on which Father Paďssy had found Alyosha sitting in the morning.-RRB-
<p/>Another memory cherished in the monastery was that of the famous Father Varsonofy, who was only recently dead and had preceded Father Zossima in the eldership.
<p/>There was a tradition that both of these had lain in their coffins as though alive, that they had shown no signs of decomposition when they were buried and that there had been a holy light in their faces.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was reverenced during his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) lifetime as a crazy saint by all the pilgrims to the monastery. And some people even insisted that a sweet fragrance came from their bodies.
<p/>Yet, in spite of these edifying memories, it would be difficult to explain the frivolity, absurdity and malice that were manifested beside the coffin of Father Zossima.
<p/>It is my private opinion that several different causes were simultaneously at work, one of which was the deeply-rooted hostility to the institution of elders as a pernicious innovation, an antipathy hidden deep in the hearts of many of the monks.
<p/>Even more powerful was jealousy of the dead man's saintliness, so firmly established during his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lifetime that it was almost a forbidden thing to question it.
<p/>For though the late elder had won over many hearts, more by love than by miracles, and had gathered round him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a mass of loving adherents, none the less, in fact, rather the more on that account he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had awakened jealousy and
<p/>so had come to have bitter enemies, secret and open, not only in the monastery but in the world outside it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did no one any harm, but <div class="bookquote">``Why do they think him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so saintly? ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And that question alone, gradually repeated, gave rise at last to an intense, insatiable hatred of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>That, I believe, was why many people were extremely delighted at the smell of decomposition which came so quickly, for not a day had passed since his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) death.
<p/>At the same time there were some among those who had been hitherto reverently devoted to the elder, who were almost mortified and personally affronted by this incident.
<p/>As soon as signs of decomposition had begun to appear, the whole aspect of the monks betrayed their secret motives in entering the cell.
<p/>They went in, stayed a little while and hastened out to confirm the news to the crowd of other monks waiting outside.
<p/>Some of the latter shook their heads mournfully, but others did not even care to conceal the delight which gleamed unmistakably in their malignant eyes.
<p/>And now no one reproached them for it, no one raised his (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) voice in protest, which was strange, for the majority of the monks had been devoted to the dead elder.
<p/>This was how the thing happened. But it seemed as though God had in this case let the minority get the upper hand for a time.
<p/>Visitors from outside, particularly of the educated class, soon went into the cell, too, with the same spying intent. Of the peasantry few went into the cell, though there were crowds of them at the gates of the hermitage.
<p/>After three o'clock the rush of worldly visitors was greatly increased and this was no doubt owing to the shocking news.
<p/>People were attracted who would not otherwise have come on that day and had not intended to come, and among them were some personages of high standing.
<p/>But external decorum was still preserved and Father Paďssy, with a stern face, continued firmly and distinctly reading aloud the Gospel, apparently not noticing what was taking place around him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) had, in fact, observed something unusual long before.
<p/>But at last the murmurs, first subdued but gradually louder and more confident, reached even him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>). '' It shows God's judgment is not as man's,'' Father Paďssy heard suddenly.
<p/>The first to give utterance to this sentiment was a layman, an elderly official from the town, known to be a man of great piety.
<p/>They had long before formulated this damning conclusion, and the worst of it was that a sort of triumphant satisfaction at that conclusion became more and more apparent every moment.
<p/>Soon they began to lay aside even external decorum and almost seemed to feel they had a sort of right to discard it.
<p/>And for what reason can this have happened,'' some of the monks said, at first with a show of regret; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a small frame and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flesh was dried up on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bones, what was there to decay?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the monks</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only repeated aloud what the monks had long been whispering. '' <div class="bookquote">``It must be a sign from heaven,''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>others hastened to add, and their opinion was adopted at once without protest.
<p/>For it was pointed out, too, that if the decomposition had been natural, as in the case of every dead sinner, it would have been apparent later, after a lapse of at least twenty-four hours, but this premature corruption <div class="bookquote">``was in excess of nature,''  (<font color='red'><b>every sinner</b></font>)</div>and so the finger of God was evident.
<p/>Gentle Father Iosif, the librarian, a great favorite of the dead man's, tried to reply to some of the evil speakers that <div class="bookquote">``this is not held everywhere alike,''  (<font color='red'><b>the speakers</b></font>)</div>and that the incorruptibility of the bodies of the just was not a dogma of the Orthodox Church, but only an opinion, and that even in the most Orthodox regions, at Athos for instance, they were not greatly confounded by the smell of corruption, and there the chief sign of the glorification of the saved was not bodily incorruptibility, but the color of the bones when the bodies have lain many years in the earth and have decayed in it.
<p/>And if the bones are yellow as wax, that is the great sign that the Lord has glorified the dead saint, if they are not yellow but black, it shows that God has not deemed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) worthy of such glory--that is the belief in Athos, a great place, where the Orthodox doctrine has been preserved from of old, unbroken and in its greatest purity,'' said Father Iosif in conclusion.
<p/>It was meant for a sign. This conclusion seemed irresistible. '' But the meek Father's words had little effect and even provoked a mocking retort.
<p/>'' That's all pedantry and innovation, no use listening to it,'' the monks decided. '' We stick to the old doctrine, there are all sorts of innovations nowadays, are we to follow them all?
<p/>'' added others. '' We have had as many holy fathers as they had. There they are among the Turks, they have forgotten everything.
<p/>Father Iosif walked away, grieving the more since he (<font color='blue'><b>Iosif</b></font>) had put forward his (<font color='blue'><b>Iosif</b></font>) own opinion with little confidence as though scarcely believing in it himself.
<p/>Their doctrine has long been impure and they have no bells even,'' the most sneering added. He (<font color='blue'><b>Iosif</b></font>) foresaw with distress that something very unseemly was beginning and that there were positive signs of disobedience.
<p/>And so it came to pass that all who loved the elder and had accepted with devout obedience the institution of the eldership
<p/>Little by little, all the sensible monks were reduced to silence like Father Iosif. were all at once terribly cast down and glanced timidly in one another's faces, when they met.
<p/>Those who were hostile to the institution of elders, as a novelty, held up their heads proudly. '' There was no smell of corruption from the late elder Varsonofy, but a sweet fragrance,'' they recalled malignantly.
<p/>'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Iosif</b></font>) gained that glory not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Iosif</b></font>) was an elder, but because he (<font color='blue'><b>Iosif</b></font>) was a holy man. '' And this was followed by a shower of criticism and even blame of Father Zossima.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) teaching was false; he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) taught that life is a great joy and not a vale of tears,'' said some of the more unreasonable.
<p/>'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) followed the fashionable belief, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) did not recognize material fire in hell,'' others, still more unreasonable, added. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was not strict in fasting, allowed himself sweet things, ate cherry jam with his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) tea, ladies used to send it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) sat in pride,'' the most malignant declared vindictively; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) considered himself a saint and he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) took it as his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) due when people knelt before him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Is it for a monk of strict rule to drink tea?'' could be heard among some of the envious. '' ''
<p/>And among these were some of the oldest monks, strictest in their devotion, genuine ascetics, who had kept silent during the life of the deceased elder, but now suddenly unsealed their lips.
<p/>And this was terrible, for their words had great influence on young monks who were not yet firm in their convictions.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) abused the sacrament of confession,'' the fiercest opponents of the institution of elders added in a malicious whisper. The monk from Obdorsk heard all this attentively, heaving deep sighs and nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) head.
<p/>Yes, clearly Father Ferapont was right in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) judgment yesterday,'' and at that moment Father Ferapont himself made his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) appearance, as though on purpose to increase the confusion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) was seldom even seen at church and they overlooked this neglect on the ground of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) craziness, and did not keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) to the rules binding on all the rest.
<p/>'' I have mentioned already that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) rarely left his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) wooden cell by the apiary. But if the whole truth is to be told, they hardly had a choice about it.
<p/>For it would have been discreditable to insist on burdening with the common regulations so great an ascetic, who prayed day and night -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) even dropped asleep on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) knees-RRB-.
<p/>If they had insisted, the monks would have said, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) is holier than all of us and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) follows a rule harder than ours.
<p/>And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) does not go to church, it's because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) knows when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) ought to; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) own rule.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the monks</b></font>)</div>It was to avoid the chance of these sinful murmurs that Father Ferapont was left in peace. As every one was aware, Father Ferapont particularly disliked Father Zossima.
<p/>And now the news had reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) hut that <div class="bookquote">``God's judgment is not the same as man's,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and that something had happened which was <div class="bookquote">``in excess of nature.
<p/>It may well be supposed that among the first to run to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) with the news was the monk from Obdorsk, who had visited him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) the evening before and left his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) cell terror-stricken.
<p/>I have mentioned above, that though Father Paďssy, standing firm and immovable reading the Gospel over the coffin, could not hear nor see what was passing outside the cell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) gauged most of it correctly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) heart, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) knew the men surrounding him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>), well.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) was not shaken by it, but awaited what would come next without fear, watching with penetration and insight for the outcome of the general excitement.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Suddenly an extraordinary uproar in the passage in open defiance of decorum burst on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) ears. The door was flung open and Father Ferapont appeared in the doorway.
<p/>They did not, however, enter the cell, but stood at the bottom of the steps, waiting to see what Father Ferapont would say or do.
<p/>Behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) there could be seen accompanying him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) a crowd of monks, together with many people from the town. For they felt with a certain awe, in spite of their audacity, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) had not come for nothing.
<p/>Standing in the doorway, Father Ferapont raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) arms, and under his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) right arm the keen inquisitive little eyes of the monk from Obdorsk peeped in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) alone, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) intense curiosity, could not resist running up the steps after Father Ferapont. The others, on the contrary, pressed farther back in sudden alarm when the door was noisily flung open.
<p/>Holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hands aloft, Father Ferapont suddenly roared: <div class="bookquote">``Casting out I cast out!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ferapont/Father Ferapont</b></font>)</div>and, turning in all directions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) began at once making the sign of the cross at each of the four walls and four corners of the cell in succession.
<p/>For they knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) always did this wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) went, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) would not sit down or say a word, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) had driven out the evil spirits.
<p/>All who accompanied Father Ferapont immediately understood his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) action. '' Satan, go hence! Satan, go hence! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) repeated at each sign of the cross.
<p/>'' Casting out I cast out,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) roared again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) was wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) coarse gown girt with a rope. His (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) bare chest, covered with gray hair, could be seen under his (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) hempen shirt.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) feet were bare. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) began waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) arms, the cruel irons he (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) wore under his (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) gown could be heard clanking.
<p/>Father Paďssy paused in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) reading, stepped forward and stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) waiting. '' What have you come for, worthy Father?
<p/>Why do you offend against good order? Why do you disturb the peace of the flock? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said at last, looking sternly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).
<p/>'' What have I come for? You ask why? What is your faith?'' shouted Father Ferapont crazily. '' I've come here to drive out your visitors, the unclean devils.
<p/>I've come to see how many have gathered here while I have been away. I want to sweep them out with a birch broom.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You cast out the evil spirit, but perhaps you are serving him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>Father Paďssy went on fearlessly. '' And who can say of himself 'I am holy'?
<p/>I would not sit in an arm-chair and would not have them bow down to me as an idol,'' thundered Father Ferapont.
<p/>The dead man, your saint,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) turned to the crowd, pointing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) finger to the coffin, <div class="bookquote">``did not believe in devils.
<p/>Can you, Father?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am unclean, not holy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>folk</b></font>)</div>Nowadays folk destroy the true faith. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) gave medicine to keep off the devils.
<p/>And so they have become as common as spiders in the corners. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) has begun to stink himself. In that we see a great sign from God.
<p/>'' The incident he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) referred to was this. One of the monks was haunted in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) dreams and, later on, in waking moments, by visions of evil spirits.
<p/>But when that was of no use, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) advised him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), while persisting in prayer and fasting, to take a special medicine.
<p/>Many persons were shocked at the time and wagged their heads as they talked over it--and most of all Father Ferapont, to whom some of the censorious had hastened to report this <div class="bookquote">``extraordinary''  (<font color='red'><b>Ferapont/Father Ferapont</b></font>)</div>counsel on the part of the elder.
<p/>When in the utmost terror he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) confided this to Father Zossima, the elder had advised continual prayer and rigid fasting. <div class="bookquote">``Go away, Father!''  (<font color='red'><b>Paďssy/Father Paďssy</b></font>)</div>said Father Paďssy, in a commanding voice, <div class="bookquote">``it's not for man to judge but for God.
<p/>Perhaps we see here a `sign' which neither you, nor I, nor any one of us is able to comprehend. Go, Father, and do not trouble the flock!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Paďssy/Father Paďssy</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) repeated impressively. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) did not keep the fasts according to the rule and therefore the sign has come.
<p/>That is clear and it's a sin to hide it,'' the fanatic, carried away by a zeal that outstripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) reason, would not be quieted.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was seduced by sweetmeats, ladies brought them to him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) in their pockets, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) sipped tea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) worshiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) belly, filling it with sweet things and his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) mind with haughty thoughts...
<p/>'' And for this he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is put to shame...'' <div class="bookquote">``You speak lightly, Father.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Father Paďssy, too, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) voice. '' I admire your fasting and severities, but you speak lightly like some frivolous youth, fickle and childish.
<p/>Go away, Father, I command you!'' Father Paďssy thundered in conclusion. '' I will go,'' said Ferapont, seeming somewhat taken aback, but still as bitter.
<p/>'' You learned men! You are so clever you look down upon my humbleness. I came hither with little learning and here I have forgotten what I did know
<p/>Father Ferapont paused and, suddenly leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) cheek on his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hand despondently, pronounced in a sing-song voice, looking at the coffin of the dead elder:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To-morrow they will sing over him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) `Our Helper and Defender'--a splendid anthem--and over me when I die all they'll sing will be `What earthly joy'--a little canticle,'' (<font color='red'><b>Ferapont/Father Ferapont</b></font>)</div>-LRB-6-RRB-
<p/>, God Himself has preserved me in my weakness from your subtlety. '' Father Paďssy stood over him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), waiting resolutely. he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) added with tearful regret.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) shouted suddenly like a madman, and with a wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) turned quickly and quickly descended the steps.
<p/>The crowd awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) below wavered; some followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) at once and some lingered, for the cell was still open, and Father Paďssy, following Father Ferapont on to the steps, stood watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).
<p/>'' You are proud and puffed up, this is a vain place!'' But the excited old fanatic was not completely silenced.
<p/>Walking twenty steps away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) suddenly turned towards the setting sun, raised both his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) arms and, as though some one had cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) down, fell to the ground with a loud scream.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) shouted frantically, stretching up his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hands to the sun, and falling face downwards on the ground, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) sobbed like a little child, shaken by his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) tears and spreading out his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) arms on the ground.
<p/>Then all rushed up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>); there were exclamations and sympathetic sobs ... a kind of frenzy seemed to take possession of them all.
<p/>'' My God has conquered! Christ has conquered the setting sun! '' This is the one who is a saint! This is the one who is a holy man!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't be an elder ... he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would refuse ... he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't serve a cursed innovation ... he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't imitate their foolery,'' other voices chimed in at once.
<p/>And it is hard to say how far they might have gone, but at that moment the bell rang summoning them to service.
<p/>'' some cried aloud, losing their fear. '' This is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who should be an elder,'' others added malignantly. '' All began crossing themselves at once.
<p/>Father Ferapont, too, got up and crossing himself went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>) cell without looking round, still uttering exclamations which were utterly incoherent.
<p/>A few followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferapont</b></font>), but the greater number dispersed, hastening to service. Father Paďssy let Father Iosif read in his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) place and went down.
<p/>The frantic outcries of bigots could not shake him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), but his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) heart was suddenly filled with melancholy for some special reason and he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) felt that.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) stood still and suddenly wondered, <div class="bookquote">``Why am I sad even to dejection?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and immediately grasped with surprise that his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) sudden sadness was due to a very small and special cause.
<p/>In the crowd thronging at the entrance to the cell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had noticed Alyosha and he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had felt at once a pang at heart on seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).
<p/>'' Can that boy mean so much to my heart now? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked himself, wondering. At that moment Alyosha passed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), hurrying away, but not in the direction of the church.
<p/>Alyosha quickly turned away his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes and dropped them to the ground, and from the boy's look alone, Father Paďssy guessed what a great change was taking place in him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) at that moment.
<p/>Their eyes met. '' Have you, too, fallen into temptation?'' cried Father Paďssy. '' Can you be with those of little faith?
<p/>Alyosha stood still and gazed vaguely at Father Paďssy, but quickly turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) eyes away again and again looked on the ground.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) added mournfully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) stood sideways and did not turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) face to Father Paďssy, who watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) attentively. ''
<p/>Where are you hastening? The bell calls to service,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) asked again, but again Alyosha gave no answer. '' Are you leaving the hermitage?
<p/>Alyosha suddenly gave a wry smile, cast a strange, very strange, look at the Father to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) former guide, the former sovereign of his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) heart and mind, his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) beloved elder, had confided him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) lay dying.
<p/>And suddenly, still without speaking, waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hand, as though not caring even to be respectful, and with rapid steps walked towards the gates away from the hermitage.
<p/>What, without asking leave, without asking a blessing? '' '' You will come back again!'' murmured Father Paďssy, looking after him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) with sorrowful surprise.
<p/>A Critical Moment Father Paďssy, of course, was not wrong when he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) decided that his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``dear boy''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>would come back again.
<p/>Yet I must frankly own that it would be very difficult for me to give a clear account of that strange, vague moment in the life of the young hero I love so much.
<p/>Chapter II. Perhaps indeed, to some extent, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) penetrated with insight into the true meaning of Alyosha's spiritual condition. To Father Paďssy's sorrowful question, <div class="bookquote">``Are you too with those of little faith?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Paďssy/Father Paďssy</b></font>)</div>I could of course confidently answer for Alyosha, ``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is not with those of little faith. Quite the contrary.
<p/>But still the trouble was there and was so agonizing that even long afterwards Alyosha thought of that sorrowful day as one of the bitterest and most fatal days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) life.
<p/>If the question is asked: <div class="bookquote">``Could all his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) grief and disturbance have been only due to the fact that his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) elder's body had shown signs of premature decomposition instead of at once performing miracles?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Indeed, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) trouble came from the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was of great faith. '' I must answer without beating about the bush, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it certainly was.
<p/>I would only beg the reader not to be in too great a hurry to laugh at my young hero's pure heart.
<p/>I am far from intending to apologize for him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) or to justify his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) innocent faith on the ground of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) youth, or the little progress he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) had made in his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) studies, or any such reason.
<p/>No doubt a youth who received impressions cautiously, whose love was lukewarm, and whose mind was too prudent for his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) age and so of little value,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I must declare, on the contrary, that I have genuine respect for the qualities of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) heart. such a young man might, I admit, have avoided what happened to my hero.
<p/>But in some cases it is really more creditable to be carried away by an emotion, however unreasonable, which springs from a great love, than to be unmoved.
<p/>And this is even truer in youth, for a young man who is always sensible is to be suspected and is of little worth--that's my opinion!
<p/>But,'' reasonable people will exclaim perhaps, ``every young man cannot believe in such a superstition and your hero is no model for others.
<p/>To this I reply again, <div class="bookquote">``Yes! my hero had faith, a faith holy and steadfast, but still I am not going to apologize for him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>).
<p/>Though I declared above, and perhaps too hastily, that I should not explain or justify my hero, I see that some explanation is necessary for the understanding of the rest of my story.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' Let me say then, it was not a question of miracles. There was no frivolous and impatient expectation of miracles in his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) mind.
<p/>oh, no, not at all--what he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) saw before all was one figure--the figure of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) beloved elder, the figure of that holy man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) revered with such adoration.
<p/>The fact is that all the love that lay concealed in his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) pure young heart for every one and everything had, for the past year, been concentrated--and perhaps wrongly so--on one being, his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) beloved elder.
<p/>It is true that being had for so long been accepted by him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) ideal, that all his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) young strength and energy could not but turn towards that ideal, even to the forgetting at the moment ``of every one and everything.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) remembered afterwards how, on that terrible day, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) had entirely forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) brother Dmitri, about whom he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) had been so anxious and troubled the day before; he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) had forgotten, too, to take the two hundred roubles to Ilusha's father, though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had so warmly intended to do so the preceding evening.
<p/>But again it was not miracles he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) needed but only <div class="bookquote">``the higher justice''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) belief outraged by the blow that had so suddenly and cruelly wounded his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart.
<p/>And what does it signify that this <div class="bookquote">``justice''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>looked for by Alyosha inevitably took the shape of miracles to be wrought immediately by the ashes of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) adored teacher?
<p/>Why, every one in the monastery cherished the same thought and the same hope, even those whose intellects Alyosha revered, Father Paďssy himself, for instance.
<p/>And Alyosha needed no miracles at the time, for the triumph of some preconceived idea-- '' And so Alyosha, untroubled by doubts, clothed his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) dreams too in the same form as all the rest.
<p/>And a whole year of life in the monastery had formed the habit of this expectation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) heart. But it was justice, justice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) thirsted for, not simply miracles.
<p/>And now the man who should, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed, have been exalted above every one in the whole world, that man, instead of receiving the glory that was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) due, was suddenly degraded and dishonored!
<p/>What for? Who had judged him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Who could have decreed this? Those were the questions that wrung his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inexperienced and virginal heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not endure without mortification, without resentment even, that the holiest of holy men should have been exposed to the jeering and spiteful mockery of the frivolous crowd so inferior to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Even had there been no miracles, had there been nothing marvelous to justify his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hopes, why this indignity, why this humiliation, why this premature decay, <div class="bookquote">``in excess of nature,''  (<font color='red'><b>the monks</b></font>)</div>as the spiteful monks said?
<p/>Why this <div class="bookquote">``sign from heaven,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>which they so triumphantly acclaimed in company with Father Ferapont, and why did they believe they had gained the right to acclaim it?
<p/>Why did Providence hide its face <div class="bookquote">``at the most critical moment''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>-LRB-so Alyosha thought it-RRB-, as though voluntarily submitting to the blind, dumb, pitiless laws of nature?
<p/>That was why Alyosha's heart was bleeding, and, of course, as I have said already, the sting of it all was that the man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved above everything on earth should be put to shame and humiliated!
<p/>This murmuring may have been shallow and unreasonable in my hero, but I repeat again for the third time--and am prepared to admit that it might be difficult to defend my feeling
<p/>--I am glad that my hero showed himself not too reasonable at that moment, for any man of sense will always come back to reason in time, but, if love does not gain the upper hand in a boy's heart at such an exceptional moment, when will it?
<p/>I will not, however, omit to mention something strange, which came for a time to the surface of Alyosha's mind at this fatal and obscure moment.
<p/>Where is the finger of Providence? This new something was the harassing impression left by the conversation with Ivan, which now persistently haunted Alyosha's mind.
<p/>At this moment it haunted him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). Oh, it was not that something of the fundamental, elemental, so to speak, faith of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) soul had been shaken.
<p/>Yet a vague but tormenting and evil impression left by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) conversation with Ivan the day before, suddenly revived again now in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) soul and seemed forcing its way to the surface of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) consciousness.
<p/>It had begun to get dusk when Rakitin, crossing the pine copse from the hermitage to the monastery, suddenly noticed Alyosha, lying face downwards on the ground under a tree, not moving and apparently asleep.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) God and believed in Him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) steadfastly, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was suddenly murmuring against Him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) went up and called him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) name.
<p/>'' You here, Alexey? Can you have--'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) began wondering but broke off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) had meant to say, <div class="bookquote">``Can you have come to this?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Alyosha did not look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>), but from a slight movement Rakitin at once saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) heard and understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>).
<p/>'' What's the matter? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) went on; but the surprise in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) face gradually passed into a smile that became more and more ironical.
<p/>'' I say, I've been looking for you for the last two hours. You suddenly disappeared. What are you about? What foolery is this?
<p/>You might just look at me... '' Alyosha raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) head, sat up and leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) back against the tree. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was not crying, but there was a look of suffering and irritability in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) did not look at Rakitin, however, but looked away to one side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>). '' Do you know your face is quite changed?
<p/>There's none of your famous mildness to be seen in it. Are you angry with some one? Have they been ill-treating you?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha suddenly, with a weary gesture of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) hand, still looking away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>). '' Oho! So that's how we are feeling!
<p/>So you can shout at people like other mortals. That is a come-down from the angels. I say, Alyosha, you have surprised me, do you hear?
<p/>I mean it. It's long since I've been surprised at anything here. I always took you for an educated man... '' Alyosha at last looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but vaguely, as though scarcely understanding what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Can you really be so upset simply because your old man has begun to stink? You don't mean to say you seriously believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going to work miracles?
<p/>'' exclaimed Rakitin, genuinely surprised again. '' I believed, I believe, I want to believe, and I will believe, what more do you want?'' cried Alyosha irritably.
<p/>But there.... So now you are in a temper with your God, you are rebelling against Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hasn't given promotion, He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hasn't bestowed the order of merit!
<p/>'' Nothing at all, my boy. Damn it all! why, no schoolboy of thirteen believes in that now. Eh, you are a set!''
<p/>Alyosha gazed a long while with his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) eyes half closed at Rakitin, and there was a sudden gleam in his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) eyes ... but not of anger with Rakitin.
<p/>'' I am not rebelling against my God; I simply `don't accept His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) world.' '' Alyosha suddenly smiled a forced smile.
<p/>'' How do you mean, you don't accept the world? '' Rakitin thought a moment over his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) answer. '' What idiocy is this?
<p/>'' Alyosha did not answer. <div class="bookquote">``Come, enough nonsense, now to business. Have you had anything to eat to- day?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't remember....
<p/>I think I have. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You need keeping up, to judge by your face. It makes one sorry to look at you.
<p/>You didn't sleep all night either, I hear, you had a meeting in there. And then all this bobbery afterwards. Most likely you've had nothing to eat but a mouthful of holy bread.
<p/>I've got some sausage in my pocket; I've brought it from the town in case of need, only you won't eat sausage...''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me some.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I say! You are going it! Why, it's a regular mutiny, with barricades! Well, my boy, we must make the most of it.
<p/>Come to my place.... I shouldn't mind a drop of vodka myself, I am tired to death. Vodka is going too far for you, I suppose ...
<p/>or would you like some?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Give me some vodka too.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hullo</b></font>)</div>'' Hullo! You surprise me, brother!'' Rakitin looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) in amazement.
<p/>'' Well, one way or another, vodka or sausage, this is a jolly fine chance and mustn't be missed. Come along.
<p/>'' Alyosha got up in silence and followed Rakitin. '' If your little brother Ivan could see this-- wouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) be surprised!
<p/>By the way, your brother Ivan set off to Moscow this morning, did you know?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>answered Alyosha listlessly, and suddenly the image of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother Dmitri rose before his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) mind.
<p/>But only for a minute, and though it reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) of something that must not be put off for a moment, some duty, some terrible obligation, even that reminder made no impression on him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), did not reach his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) heart and instantly faded out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) mind and was forgotten.
<p/>But, a long while afterwards, Alyosha remembered this. '' Your brother Ivan declared once that I was a `liberal booby with no talents whatsoever.'
<p/>Once you, too, could not resist letting me know I was `dishonorable.' Well! I should like to see what your talents and sense of honor will do for you now.
<p/>'' This phrase Rakitin finished to himself in a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``Listen! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) said aloud, <div class="bookquote">``let's go by the path beyond the monastery straight to the town.
<p/>Only fancy, I've written to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) everything that happened, and would you believe it, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) answered me instantly in pencil -LRB-the lady has a passion for writing notes-RRB- that `she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would never have expected such conduct from a man of such a reverend character as Father Zossima.'
<p/>Hm! I ought to go to Madame Hohlakov's by the way. That was her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) very word: `conduct.' She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is angry too.
<p/>Eh, you are a set! Stay!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) cried suddenly again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) suddenly stopped and taking Alyosha by the shoulder made him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) stop too.
<p/>Do you know, Alyosha,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) peeped inquisitively into his (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) eyes, absorbed in a sudden new thought which had dawned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>), and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) was laughing outwardly he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) was evidently afraid to utter that new idea aloud, so difficult he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) still found it to believe in the strange and unexpected mood in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) now saw Alyosha.
<p/>'' '' Alyosha, do you know where we had better go? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Zossima</b></font>) brought out at last timidly, and insinuatingly. ''
<p/>I don't care ... where you like.'' <div class="bookquote">``Let's go to Grushenka, eh? Will you come? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Rakitin/Mr. Rakitin</b></font>)</div>pronounced Rakitin at last, trembling with timid suspense.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's go to Grushenka,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha answered calmly, at once, and this prompt and calm agreement was such a surprise to Rakitin that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) almost started back.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) cried in amazement, but seizing Alyosha firmly by the arm he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) led him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) along the path, still dreading that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) would change his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) mind.
<p/>'' Well! I say! '' They walked along in silence, Rakitin was positively afraid to talk. '' And how glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) will be, how delighted!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) muttered, but lapsed into silence again. And indeed it was not to please Grushenka he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was taking Alyosha to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) object in this case was twofold, first a revengeful desire to see <div class="bookquote">``the downfall of the righteous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>and Alyosha's fall <div class="bookquote">``from the saints to the sinners,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>over which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was already gloating in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) imagination, and in the second place he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) had in view a certain material gain for himself, of which more will be said later.
<p/>So the critical moment has come,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) thought to himself with spiteful glee, <div class="bookquote">``and we shall catch it on the hop, for it's just what we want.
<p/>An Onion Grushenka lived in the busiest part of the town, near the cathedral square, in a small wooden lodge in the courtyard belonging to the house of the widow Morozov.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morozov</b></font>) was a practical person and never undertook anything without a prospect of gain for himself. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Chapter III. The house was a large stone building of two stories, old and very ugly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had no need to let her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) lodge, but every one knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had taken in Grushenka as a lodger, four years before, solely to please her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) kinsman, the merchant Samsonov, who was known to be the girl's protector.
<p/>It was said that the jealous old man's object in placing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``favorite''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>with the widow Morozov was that the old woman should keep a sharp eye on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) new lodger's conduct.
<p/>But this sharp eye soon proved to be unnecessary, and in the end the widow Morozov seldom met Grushenka and did not worry her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) by looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) in any way.
<p/>It is true that four years had passed since the old man had brought the slim, delicate, shy, timid, dreamy, and sad girl of eighteen from the chief town of the province, and much had happened since then.
<p/>The widow led a secluded life with her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) two unmarried nieces, who were also elderly women. Little was known of the girl's history in the town and that little was vague.
<p/>Nothing more had been learnt during the last four years, even after many persons had become interested in the beautiful young woman into whom Agrafena Alexandrovna had meanwhile developed.
<p/>There were rumors that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been at seventeen betrayed by some one, some sort of officer, and immediately afterwards abandoned by him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>).
<p/>It was said, however, that though Grushenka had been raised from destitution by the old man, Samsonov, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came of a respectable family belonging to the clerical class, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was the daughter of a deacon or something of the sort.
<p/>And now after four years the sensitive, injured and pathetic little orphan had become a plump, rosy beauty of the Russian type, a woman of bold and determined character, proud and insolent.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had a good head for business, was acquisitive, saving and careful, and by fair means or foul had succeeded, it was said, in amassing a little fortune.
<p/>The officer had gone away and afterwards married, while Grushenka had been left in poverty and disgrace. There was only one point on which all were agreed.
<p/>Grushenka was not easily to be approached and except her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) aged protector there had not been one man who could boast of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) favors during those four years.
<p/>It was a positive fact, for there had been a good many, especially during the last two years, who had attempted to obtain those favors.
<p/>But all their efforts had been in vain and some of these suitors had been forced to beat an undignified and even comic retreat, owing to the firm and ironical resistance they met from the strong-willed young person.
<p/>especially of late, been given to what is called <div class="bookquote">``speculation,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had shown marked abilities in that direction, so that many people began to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was no better than a Jew.
<p/>It was not that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lent money on interest, but it was known, for instance, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had for some time past, in partnership with old Karamazov, actually invested in the purchase of bad debts for a trifle, a tenth of their nominal value, and afterwards had made out of them ten times their value.
<p/>It was known, too, that the young person had, The old widower Samsonov, a man of large fortune, was stingy and merciless.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) tyrannized over his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) grown-up sons, but, for the last year during which he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) had been ill and lost the use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) swollen legs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) had fallen greatly under the influence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) protégée, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) had at first kept strictly and in humble surroundings, <div class="bookquote">``on Lenten fare,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as the wits said at the time.
<p/>The old man, now long since dead, had had a large business in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) day and was also a noteworthy character, miserly and hard as flint.
<p/>Though Grushenka's hold upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so strong that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not live without her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) -LRB-it had been so especially for the last two years-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not settle any considerable fortune on her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and would not have been moved to do so, if she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had threatened to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had presented her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with a small sum, and even that was a surprise to every one when it became known.
<p/>You are a wench with brains,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eight thousand roubles, <div class="bookquote">``and you must look after yourself, but let me tell you that except your yearly allowance as before, you'll get nothing more from me to the day of my death, and I'll leave you nothing in my will either.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) word; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) died and left everything to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sons, whom, with their wives and children, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had treated all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life as servants.
<p/>But Grushenka had succeeded in emancipating herself, while she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) established in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a boundless belief in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fidelity. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Grushenka was not even mentioned in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will.
<p/>All this became known afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) helped Grushenka with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) advice to increase her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) capital and put business in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way.
<p/>When Fyodor Pavlovitch, who first came into contact with Grushenka over a piece of speculation, ended to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) own surprise by falling madly in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), old Samsonov, gravely ill as he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) was, was immensely amused.
<p/>It is remarkable that throughout their whole acquaintance Grushenka was absolutely and spontaneously open with the old man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seems to have been the only person in the world with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so.
<p/>Of late, when Dmitri too had come on the scene with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) love, the old man left off laughing. On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) once gave Grushenka a stern and earnest piece of advice.
<p/>If you have to choose between the two, father or son, you'd better choose the old man, if only you make sure the old scoundrel will marry you and settle some fortune on you beforehand.
<p/>These were the very words of the old profligate, who felt already that his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) death was not far off and who actually died five months later.
<p/>I will note, too, in passing, that although many in our town knew of the grotesque and monstrous rivalry of the Karamazovs, father and son, the object of which was Grushenka, scarcely any one understood what really underlay her (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) attitude to both of them.
<p/>Even Grushenka's two servants -LRB-after the catastrophe of which we will speak later-RRB- testified in court that she (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) received Dmitri Fyodorovitch simply from fear because <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) threatened to murder her (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>).
<p/>These servants were an old cook, invalidish and almost deaf, who came from Grushenka's old home, and her (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) granddaughter, a smart young girl of twenty, who performed the duties of a maid.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dmitri/Dmitri Fyodorovitch/Dmitri Karamazov</b></font>)</div>But don't keep on with the captain, you'll get no good out of that. '' '' Grushenka lived very economically and her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) surroundings were anything but luxurious.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) lodge consisted of three rooms furnished with mahogany furniture in the fashion of 1820, belonging to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) landlady. It was quite dark when Rakitin and Alyosha entered her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) rooms, yet they were not lighted up.
<p/>Grushenka was lying down in her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) drawing-room on the big, hard, clumsy sofa, with a mahogany back. The sofa was covered with shabby and ragged leather.
<p/>Under her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) head she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had two white down pillows taken from her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was lying stretched out motionless on her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) back with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) hands behind her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) head.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was dressed as though expecting some one, in a black silk dress, with a dainty lace fichu on her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) head, which was very becoming.
<p/>Over her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) shoulders was thrown a lace shawl pinned with a massive gold brooch. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) certainly was expecting some one. She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) lay
<p/>as though impatient and weary, her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) face rather pale and her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) lips and eyes hot, restlessly tapping the arm of the sofa with the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) right foot.
<p/>From the hall they could hear Grushenka leap up from the sofa and cry out in a frightened voice, <div class="bookquote">``Who's there?
<p/>The appearance of Rakitin and Alyosha caused a slight excitement. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>But the maid met the visitors and at once called back to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) mistress.
<p/>'' It's not he (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>), it's nothing, only other visitors. '' <div class="bookquote">``What can be the matter? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Rakitin/Mr. Rakitin</b></font>)</div>muttered Rakitin, leading Alyosha into the drawing-room.
<p/>A thick coil of her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) dark brown hair escaped from its lace covering and fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) right shoulder, but she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) did not notice it and did not put it back till she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) had gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) visitors and recognized them.
<p/>Grushenka was standing by the sofa as though still alarmed. '' Ah, it's you, Rakitin? You quite frightened me. Whom have you brought?
<p/>Do send for candles!'' said Rakitin, with the free-and-easy air of a most intimate friend, who is privileged to give orders in the house.
<p/>Who is this with you? Good heavens, you have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>)! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) exclaimed, recognizing Alyosha. '' '' Candles ... of course, candles....
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) exclaimed again, nodding towards Alyosha, and turning to the looking-glass she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) began quickly fastening up her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) hair with both hands.
<p/>Fenya, fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) a candle.... Well, you have chosen a moment to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>)! '' She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) seemed displeased. '' Haven't I managed to please you?
<p/>'' asked Rakitin, instantly almost offended. '' You frightened me, Rakitin, that's what it is. '' Grushenka turned with a smile to Alyosha.
<p/>Don't be afraid of me, my dear Alyosha, you cannot think how glad I am to see you, my unexpected visitor.
<p/>'' But you frightened me, Rakitin, I thought it was Mitya breaking in. You see, I deceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) just now, I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) promise to believe me
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) that I was going to spend the evening with my old man, Kuzma Kuzmitch, and should be there till late counting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>) money.
<p/>We lock ourselves in and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>) counts on the reckoning beads while I sit and put things down in the book.
<p/>and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>) a lie. I always spend one whole evening a week with him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>) making up his (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>) accounts. I am the only person he (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>) trusts.
<p/>Mitya believes that I am there, but I came back and have been sitting locked in here, expecting some news. How was it Fenya let you in?
<p/>Fenya, Fenya, run out to the gate, open it and look about whether the captain is to be seen! Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) is hiding and spying, I am dreadfully frightened.
<p/>There's no one there, Agrafena Alexandrovna, I've just looked out, I keep running to peep through the crack, I am in fear and trembling myself.''
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Are the shutters fastened, Fenya? And we must draw the curtains--that's better! ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) drew the heavy curtains herself.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'d rush in at once if he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) saw a light. I am afraid of your brother Mitya to-day, Alyosha. ''
<p/>Grushenka spoke aloud, and, though she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was alarmed, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) seemed very happy about something. '' Why are you so afraid of Mitya to-day?
<p/>'' inquired Rakitin. '' I should have thought you were not timid with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>), you'd twist him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) round your little finger.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I tell you, I am expecting news, priceless news, so I don't want Mitya at all. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) didn't believe, I feel he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) didn't, that I should stay at Kuzma Kuzmitch's.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>) must be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>) ambush now, behind Fyodor Pavlovitch's, in the garden, watching for me. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>)'s there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>) won't come here, so much the better!
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>) I should stay there till midnight, and I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>) to be sure to come at midnight to fetch me home.
<p/>But I really have been to Kuzma Kuzmitch's, Mitya escorted me there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went away and I sat ten minutes with Kuzma Kuzmitch and came back here again.
<p/>Ugh, I was afraid, I ran for fear of meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And why are you so dressed up? What a curious cap you've got on!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How curious you are yourself, Rakitin! I tell you, I am expecting a message. If the message comes, I shall fly, I shall gallop away and you will see no more of me.
<p/>That's why I am dressed up, so as to be ready.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And where are you flying to?'' '' If you know too much, you'll get old too soon.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word! You are highly delighted ... I've never seen you like this before. You are dressed up as if you were going to a ball.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Rakitin/Mr. Rakitin</b></font>)</div>Rakitin looked her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) up and down. '' Much you know about balls.'' '' And do you know much about them?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have seen a ball. The year before last, Kuzma Kuzmitch's son was married and I looked on from the gallery.
<p/>Do you suppose I want to be talking to you, Rakitin, while a prince like this is standing here. Such a visitor!
<p/>Alyosha, my dear boy , I gaze at you and can't believe my eyes. Good heavens, can you have come here to see me!
<p/>To tell you the truth, I never had a thought of seeing you and I didn't think that you would ever come and see me.
<p/>Though this is not the moment now, I am awfully glad to see you. Sit down on the sofa, here , that's right, my bright young moon.
<p/>I really can't take it in even now.... Eh, Rakitin, if only you had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) yesterday or the day before!
<p/>But I am glad as it is! Perhaps it's better he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) has come now, at such a moment, and not the day before yesterday.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) gayly sat down beside Alyosha on the sofa, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) with positive delight. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) really was glad, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was not lying when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) said so.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) eyes glowed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) lips laughed, but it was a good-hearted merry laugh. Alyosha had not expected to see such a kind expression in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) face....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) had hardly met her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) till the day before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) had formed an alarming idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>), and had been horribly distressed the day before by the spiteful and treacherous trick she (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) had played on Katerina Ivanovna.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was greatly surprised to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) now altogether different from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) had expected. And, crushed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was by his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) own sorrow, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) eyes involuntarily rested on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) with attention.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) whole manner seemed changed for the better since yesterday, there was scarcely any trace of that mawkish sweetness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) speech, of that voluptuous softness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) movements.
<p/>Everything was simple and good-natured, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) gestures were rapid, direct, confiding, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was greatly excited. '' Dear me, how everything comes together to-day!
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) chattered on again. '' And why I am so glad to see you, Alyosha, I couldn't say myself! If you ask me, I couldn't tell you.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, don't you know why you're glad?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rakitin/Mr. Rakitin</b></font>)</div>said Rakitin, grinning. '' You used to be always pestering me to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>), you'd some object, I suppose.

<p/>Look, Alyosha, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>)'s sitting there opposite us, so offended that I didn't ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) to sit down before you. Ugh, Rakitin is such a one to take offense!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>laughed Grushenka. '' Don't be angry, Rakitin, I'm kind to-day. Why are you so depressed, Alyosha? Are you afraid of me?''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) peeped into his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) eyes with merry mockery'' <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>)'s sad.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) suddenly skipped forward and jumped, laughing, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) knee, like a nestling kitten, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) right arm about his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) neck.
<p/>Let me sit on your knee, Alyosha, like this. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I'll cheer you up, my pious boy. Yes, really, will you let me sit on your knee?

<p/>But there was nothing in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heart such as Rakitin, for instance, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) malignantly from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) corner, might have expected or fancied.
<p/>The great grief in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heart swallowed up every sensation that might have been aroused, and, if only he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could have thought clearly at that moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would have realized that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had now the strongest armor to protect him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) from every lust and temptation.
<p/>Yet in spite of the vague irresponsiveness of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) spiritual condition and the sorrow that overwhelmed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could not help wondering at a new and strange sensation in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heart.
<p/>This woman, this <div class="bookquote">``dreadful''  (<font color='red'><b>This woman woman</b></font>)</div>woman, had no terror for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) now, none of that terror that had stirred in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) soul at any passing thought of woman.
<p/>On the contrary, this woman, dreaded above all women, sitting now on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knee, holding him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms, aroused in him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) now a quite different, unexpected, peculiar feeling, a feeling of the intensest and purest interest without a trace of fear, of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) former terror.
<p/>You won't be angry? If you tell me, I'll get off? '' Alyosha did not speak. That was what instinctively surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>'' You've talked nonsense enough,'' cried Rakitin, <div class="bookquote">``you'd much better give us some champagne. You owe it me, you know you do!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Rakitin/Mr. Rakitin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I really do. Do you know, Alyosha, I promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) champagne on the top of everything, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>)'d bring you?

<p/>I can think of Alyosha here, I can look at Alyosha ... smile at me, dear, cheer up, smile at my foolishness, at my pleasure
<p/>And you know, Alyosha, I've been thinking all this time you were angry with me, because of the day before yesterday, because of that young lady.

<p/>'' This is quite different. I love Alyosha in a different way. It's true, Alyosha, I had sly designs on you before.
<p/>For I am a horrid, violent creature. But at other times I've looked upon you, Alyosha, as my conscience. I've kept thinking `how any one like that must despise a nasty thing like me.'
<p/>I have thought of you a long time in that way, Alyosha, and Mitya knows, I've talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) about it.
<p/>I thought that the day before yesterday, as I ran home from the young lady's. Mitya understands. Would you believe it, I sometimes look at you and feel ashamed, utterly ashamed of myself....
<p/>And how, and since when, I began to think about you like that, I can't say, I don't remember... '' Fenya came in and put a tray with an uncorked bottle and three glasses of champagne on the table.
<p/>'' Here's the champagne!'' cried Rakitin. '' You're excited, Agrafena Alexandrovna, and not yourself. When you've had a glass of champagne, you'll be ready to dance.
<p/>Eh, they can't even do that properly,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) added, looking at the bottle. '' The old woman's poured it out in the kitchen and the bottle's been brought in warm and without a cork.
<p/>Well, let me have some, anyway. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) went up to the table, took a glass, emptied it at one gulp and poured himself out another.
<p/>'' One doesn't often stumble upon champagne,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, licking his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lips. '' Now, Alyosha, take a glass, show what you can do!

<p/>'' And you bragged!'' cried Rakitin. '' Well, if so, I won't either,'' chimed in Grushenka, <div class="bookquote">``I really don't want any.

<p/>Good God, I did not know!'' She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) crossed herself devoutly. '' Goodness, what have I been doing, sitting on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knee like this at such a moment!''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) started up as though in dismay, instantly slipped off his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knee and sat down on the sofa. Alyosha bent a long wondering look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and a light seemed to dawn in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face.
<p/>'' Rakitin,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) said suddenly, in a firm and loud voice; <div class="bookquote">``don't taunt me with having rebelled against God. I don't want to feel angry with you, so you must be kinder, too

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Alyosha's lips were quivering and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) caught his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) breath. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has saved you, it seems,'' laughed Rakitin spitefully. ''
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) meant to get you in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) clutches , do you realize that?'' <div class="bookquote">``Stay, Rakitin. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>Grushenka jumped up. ''
<p/>Hush, both of you. Now I'll tell you all about it. Hush, Alyosha, your words make me ashamed, for I am bad and not good--that's what I am.
<p/>I had the low idea of trying to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) in my clutches, but now you are lying, now it's all different.
<p/>And you hush, Rakitin, because you are telling lies. And don't let me hear anything more from you, Rakitin. '' All this Grushenka said with extreme emotion.
<p/>'' They are both crazy,'' said Rakitin, looking at them with amazement. '' I feel as though I were in a madhouse.
<p/>They're both getting so feeble they'll begin crying in a minute. '' <div class="bookquote">``I shall begin to cry, I shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>repeated Grushenka.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) called me his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) sister and I shall never forget that. Only let me tell you, Rakitin, though I am bad, I did give away an onion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was aggrieved and annoyed, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) might have reflected that each of them was just passing through a spiritual crisis such as does not come often in a lifetime.
<p/>But though Rakitin was very sensitive about everything that concerned himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was very obtuse as regards the feelings and sensations of others--partly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) youth and inexperience, partly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) intense egoism.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``An onion? Hang it all, you really are crazy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Rakitin/Mr. Rakitin</b></font>)</div>Rakitin wondered at their enthusiasm. '' You see, Alyosha,'' Grushenka turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) with a nervous laugh.
<p/>'' I was boasting when I told Rakitin I had given away an onion, but it's not to boast I tell you about it.
<p/>It's only a story, but it's a nice story. I used to hear it when I was a child from Matryona, my cook, who is still with me.
<p/>It's like this. Once upon a time there was a peasant woman and a very wicked woman she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was. And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) died and did not leave a single good deed behind.
<p/>So her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) guardian angel stood and wondered what good deed of hers he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) could remember to tell to God; `She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) once pulled up an onion in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) garden,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), `and gave it to a beggar woman.'
<p/>And God answered: `You take that onion then, hold it out to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in the lake, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) take hold and be pulled out.
<p/>And if you can pull her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) out of the lake, let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) come to Paradise, but if the onion breaks, then the woman must stay where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is.'
<p/>The devils caught her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and plunged her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into the lake of fire. The angel ran to the woman and held out the onion to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). '
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) had just pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) right out, when the other sinners in the lake, seeing how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was being drawn out, began catching hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) so as to be pulled out with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Come,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>), `catch hold and I'll pull you out.' And he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) began cautiously pulling her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) out. But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a very wicked woman and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began kicking them. '
<p/>I'm to be pulled out, not you. It's my onion, not yours.' As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said that, the onion broke.
<p/>And the woman fell into the lake and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is burning there to this day. So the angel wept and went away.
<p/>I boasted to Rakitin that I had given away an onion, but to you I'll say: `I've done nothing but give away one onion all my life
<p/>So that's the story, Alyosha; I know it by heart, for I am that wicked woman myself. , that's the only good deed I've done.'
<p/>So don't praise me, Alyosha, don't think me good , I am bad, I am a wicked woman and you make me ashamed if you praise me.
<p/>I was so anxious to get hold of you that I promised Rakitin twenty-five roubles if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) would bring you to me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went with rapid steps to the table, opened a drawer, pulled out a purse and took from it a twenty-five rouble note.
<p/>Eh, I must confess everything. Listen, Alyosha. Stay, Rakitin, wait! '' '' What nonsense! What nonsense!'' cried Rakitin, disconcerted. <div class="bookquote">``Take it.
<p/>Rakitin, I owe it you , there's no fear of your refusing it, you asked for it yourself. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) threw the note to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>).
<p/>'' Likely I should refuse it,'' boomed Rakitin, obviously abashed, but carrying off his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) confusion with a swagger. '' That will come in very handy; fools are made for wise men's profit.''
<p/>'' And now hold your tongue, Rakitin, what I am going to say now is not for your ears. Sit down in that corner and keep quiet.
<p/>You don't like us, so hold your tongue. '' <div class="bookquote">``What should I like you for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rakitin/Mr. Rakitin</b></font>)</div>Rakitin snarled, not concealing his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) ill- humor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) had reckoned on receiving his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) payment later, without Alyosha's knowing of it, and now, feeling ashamed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) temper.
<p/>Till that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) had thought it discreet not to contradict Grushenka too flatly in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) snubbing, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) had something to get out of her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) put the twenty-five rouble note in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) pocket and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) felt ashamed at Alyosha's seeing it. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>), too, was angry:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One loves people for some reason, but what have either of you done for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You should love people without a reason, as Alyosha does.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div><p/>Grushenka was standing in the middle of the room; she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) spoke with heat and there were hysterical notes in her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How does he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) love you? How has he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) shown it, that you make such a fuss about it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Rakitin/Mr. Rakitin</b></font>)</div>'' Hush, Rakitin, you know nothing about us!
<p/>And don't dare to speak to me like that again. How dare you be so familiar! Sit in that corner and be quiet, as though you were my footman!
<p/>And now, Alyosha, I'll tell you the whole truth, that you may see what a wretch I am! I am not talking to Rakitin, but to you.
<p/>I wanted to ruin you, Alyosha, that's the holy truth; I quite meant to. I wanted to so much, that I bribed Rakitin to bring you.
<p/>And why did I want to do such a thing? You knew nothing about it, Alyosha, you turned away from me; if you passed me, you dropped your eyes.
<p/>And I've looked at you a hundred times before to-day; I began asking every one about you. Your face haunted my heart. '
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) despises me,' I thought; `he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) won't even look at me.' And I felt it so much at last that I wondered at myself for being so frightened of a boy.
<p/>I'll get him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in my clutches and laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). I was full of spite and anger. Would you believe it, nobody here dares talk or think of coming to Agrafena Alexandrovna with any evil purpose.
<p/>Old Kuzma is the only man I have anything to do with here; I was bound and sold to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>); Satan brought us together, but there has been no one else.
<p/>But looking at you, I thought, I'll get him (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) in my clutches and laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>). You see what a spiteful cur I am, and you called me your sister!
<p/>And now that man who wronged me has come; I sit here waiting for a message from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And do you know what that man has been to me?
<p/>Five years ago, when Kuzma brought me here, I used to shut myself up, that no one might have sight or sound of me.
<p/>I was a silly slip of a girl; I used to sit here sobbing; I used to lie awake all night, thinking: `Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) now, the man who wronged me?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) is laughing at me with another woman, most likely. If only I could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>), if I could meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) again, I'd pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) out, I'd pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) out!'
<p/>At night I used to lie sobbing into my pillow in the dark, and I used to brood over it; I used to tear my heart on purpose and gloat over my anger. '
<p/>And when I suddenly thought that I should really do nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) was laughing at me then, or perhaps had utterly forgotten me, I would fling myself on the floor, melt into helpless tears, and lie there shaking till dawn.
<p/>I'll pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) out, I'll pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) out!' That's what I used to cry out in the dark. In the morning I would get up more spiteful than a dog, ready to tear the whole world to pieces.
<p/>No, no one in the whole world sees it, no one knows it, but when night comes on, I sometimes lie as I did five years ago, when I was a silly girl, clenching my teeth and crying all night, thinking, `I'll pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) out, I'll pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) out!'
<p/>And then what do you think? I began saving money, I became hard-hearted, grew stout--grew wiser, would you say? Do you hear?
<p/>Well then, now you understand me. A month ago a letter came to me --he (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) was coming, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) was a widower, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) wanted to see me.
<p/>It took my breath away; then I suddenly thought: `If he (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) comes and whistles to call me, I shall creep back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) like a beaten dog.'
<p/>And I've been in such a rage with myself all this month that I am worse than I was five years ago.
<p/>I couldn't believe myself. Am I so abject? Shall I run to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) or not? Do you see now, Alyosha, what a violent, vindictive creature I am?
<p/>I have shown you the whole truth! I played with Mitya to keep me from running to that other. Hush, Rakitin, it's not for you to judge me, I am not speaking to you.
<p/>Before you came in, I was lying here waiting, brooding, deciding my whole future life, and you can never know what was in my heart.
<p/>Yes, Alyosha, tell your young lady not to be angry with me for what happened the day before yesterday.... Nobody in the whole world knows what I am going through now, and no one ever can know....
<p/>And at this <div class="bookquote">``tragic''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>phrase Grushenka broke down, hid her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands, flung herself on the sofa pillows, and sobbed like a little child.
<p/>For perhaps I shall take a knife with me to-day, I can't make up my mind ... '' Alyosha got up and went to Rakitin.
<p/>'' Misha,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``don't be angry. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wounded you, but don't be angry. You heard what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said just now?
<p/>You mustn't ask too much of human endurance, one must be merciful. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Alyosha said this at the instinctive prompting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) felt obliged to speak and he (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) turned to Rakitin. If Rakitin had not been there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) would have spoken to the air.
<p/>You were so primed up with your elder's teaching last night that now you have to let it off on me, Alexey, man of God!'' said Rakitin, with a smile of hatred.
<p/>But Rakitin looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) ironically and Alyosha stopped short. '' '' Don't laugh, Rakitin, don't smile, don't talk of the dead--he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was better than any one in the world!
<p/>'' cried Alyosha, with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) voice. '' I didn't speak to you as a judge but as the lowest of the judged.
<p/>in my cowardliness, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>), after five years in torment, as soon as any one says a word from the heart to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>)--it makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) forget everything, forgive everything, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) tears!
<p/>The man who has wronged her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) has come back, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sends for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) forgives him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) everything, and hastens joyfully to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
<p/>What am I beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>)? I came here seeking my ruin, and said to myself, `What does it matter?' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) won't take a knife with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) won't! No, I am not like that. I don't know whether you are, Misha, but I am not like that.
<p/>It's a lesson to me.... She (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) is more loving than we.... Have you heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) speak before of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) has just told us?
<p/>No, you haven't; if you had, you'd have understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) long ago ... and the person insulted the day before yesterday must forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>), too!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) will, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) knows ... and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) shall know.... This soul is not yet at peace with itself, one must be tender with it ... there may be a treasure in that soul...
<p/>'' Alyosha stopped, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) breath. In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) ill-humor Rakitin looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) with astonishment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) had never expected such a tirade from the gentle Alyosha.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>)'s found some one to plead her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) cause! Why, are you in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>)? Agrafena Alexandrovna, our monk's really in love with you
<p/>, you've made a conquest! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) cried, with a coarse laugh. Grushenka lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) head from the pillow and looked at Alyosha with a tender smile shining on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) tear-stained face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) alone, Alyosha, my cherub; you see what he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) is, he (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) is not a person for you to speak to.

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But you have forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) already,'' said Alyosha, smiling. '' Yes, I really have forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),'' Grushenka murmured thoughtfully. ''
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) snatched up a glass from the table, emptied it at a gulp, lifted it in the air and flung it on the floor.
<p/>What an abject heart! To my abject heart! The glass broke with a crash. A little cruel line came into her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smile.
<p/>Perhaps I haven't forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), though,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, with a sort of menace in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes to the ground as though she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were talking to herself.
<p/>'' '' Perhaps my heart is only getting ready to forgive. I shall struggle with my heart. You see, Alyosha, I've grown to love my tears in these five years....
<p/>Perhaps I only love my resentment, not him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ...'' '' Well, I shouldn't care to be in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoes,'' hissed Rakitin.
<p/>'' Well, you won't be, Rakitin, you'll never be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) shoes. You shall black my shoes, Rakitin, that's the place you are fit for.
<p/>You'll never get a woman like me ... and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) won't either, perhaps ...'' <div class="bookquote">``Won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>)? Then why are you dressed up like that?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Rakitin, with a venomous sneer.
<p/>If I choose to tear off my finery, I'll tear it off at once, this minute,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried in a resonant voice.
<p/>'' Don't taunt me with dressing up, Rakitin, you don't know all that is in my heart! '' You don't know what that finery is for, Rakitin!
<p/>Perhaps I shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) and say: `Have you ever seen me look like this before?' He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) left me a thin, consumptive cry-baby of seventeen.
<p/>I'll sit by him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>), fascinate him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) and work him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) up. ' Do you see what I am like now?' I'll say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>); '
<p/>well, and that's enough for you, my dear sir, there's many a slip twixt the cup and the lip!' That may be what the finery is for, Rakitin.
<p/>I'm violent and resentful, Alyosha, I'll tear off my finery, I'll destroy my beauty, I'll scorch my face, slash it with a knife, and turn beggar.
<p/>If I choose, I'll send Kuzma back all he (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) has ever given me, to-morrow, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) money and I'll go out charing for the rest of my life.
<p/>'' Grushenka finished with a malicious laugh. '' If I choose, I won't go anywhere now to see any one. You think I wouldn't do it, Rakitin, that I would not dare to do it?
<p/>I would, I would, I could do it directly, only don't exasperate me ... and I'll send him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) about his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) business, I'll snap my fingers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) shall never see me again!''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) uttered the last words in an hysterical scream, but broke down again, hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) hands, buried it in the pillow and shook with sobs.
<p/>Rakitin got up. '' It's time we were off,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it's late, we shall be shut out of the monastery.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Grushenka leapt up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) place. '' Surely you don't want to go, Alyosha! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) cried, in mournful surprise.
<p/>'' What are you doing to me? You've stirred up my feeling, tortured me, and now you'll leave me to face this night alone!''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) can hardly spend the night with you! Though if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) wants to, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>)! I'll go alone,'' Rakitin scoffed jeeringly.
<p/>'' Hush, evil tongue! '' Grushenka cried angrily at him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``you never said such words to me as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) has come to say.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What has he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) said to you so special? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Rakitin/Mr. Rakitin</b></font>)</div>asked Rakitin irritably. '' I can't say, I don't know. I don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) said to me
<p/>, it went straight to my heart; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) has wrung my heart.... He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) is the first, the only one who has pitied me, that's what it is.
<p/>Why did you not come before, you angel?'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) knees before him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) as though in a sudden frenzy.
<p/>I've been waiting all my life for some one like you, I knew that some one like you would come and forgive me.
<p/>'' I believed that, nasty as I am, some one would really love me, not only with a shameful love!'' <div class="bookquote">``What have I done to you?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>answered Alyosha, bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) with a tender smile, and gently taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) by the hands; <div class="bookquote">``I only gave you an onion, nothing but a tiny little onion, that was all!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was moved to tears himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) said it. At that moment there was a sudden noise in the passage, some one came into the hall.
<p/>Fenya ran noisily into the room, crying out: <div class="bookquote">``Mistress, mistress darling, a messenger has galloped up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fenya</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mistress</b></font>) cried, breathless and joyful.
<p/>Grushenka jumped up, seeming greatly alarmed. '' A carriage from Mokroe for you, Timofey the driver, with three horses, they are just putting in fresh horses....
<p/>A letter, here's the letter, mistress. '' A letter was in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hand and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) waved it in the air all the while she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) talked.
<p/>Grushenka snatched the letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) and carried it to the candle. It was only a note, a few lines. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) read it in one instant.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) has sent for me,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) cried, her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) face white and distorted, with a wan smile; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) whistles! Crawl back, little dog!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But only for one instant she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) stood as though hesitating; suddenly the blood rushed to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) head and sent a glow to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) cheeks.
<p/>'' I will go,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``five years of my life! Good-by! Good-by, Alyosha, my fate is sealed. Go, go, leave me all of you, don't let me see you again!
<p/>Grushenka is flying to a new life.... Don't you remember evil against me either, Rakitin. I may be going to my death!
<p/>Ugh! I feel as though I were drunk! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) suddenly left them and ran into her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) bedroom. '' Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) has no thoughts for us now!'' grumbled Rakitin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's go, or we may hear that feminine shriek again. I am sick of all these tears and cries. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha mechanically let himself be led out.
<p/>In the yard stood a covered cart. Horses were being taken out of the shafts, men were running to and fro with a lantern.
<p/>But when Alyosha and Rakitin reached the bottom of the steps, Grushenka's bedroom window was suddenly opened and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) called in a ringing voice after Alyosha:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alyosha, give my greetings to your brother Mitya and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) not to remember evil against me, though I have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) misery.
<p/>Three fresh horses were being led in at the open gate. And tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), too, in my words: `Grushenka has fallen to a scoundrel, and not to you, noble heart.'
<p/>And add, too, that Grushenka loved him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) only one hour, only one short hour she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>)--so let him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) remember that hour all his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) life--say, `Grushenka tells you to!'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) ended in a voice full of sobs. The window was shut with a slam. '' H'm, h'm!'' growled Rakitin, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) murders your brother Mitya and then tells him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to remember it all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) life!
<p/>What ferocity!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rakitin/Mr. Rakitin</b></font>)</div>Alyosha made no reply, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seemed not to have heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) walked fast beside Rakitin as though in a terrible hurry.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was lost in thought and moved mechanically. Rakitin felt a sudden twinge as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) had been touched on an open wound.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) had expected something quite different by bringing Grushenka and Alyosha together. Something very different from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) had hoped for had happened.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) is a Pole, that officer of hers,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) began again, restraining himself; <div class="bookquote">``and indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) is not an officer at all now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) served in the customs in Siberia, somewhere on the Chinese frontier, some puny little beggar of a Pole, I expect.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Lost his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) job, they say. He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)'s heard now that Grushenka's saved a little money, so he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)'s turned up again--that's the explanation of the mystery.
<p/>'' Again Alyosha seemed not to hear. Rakitin could not control himself. '' Well, so you've saved the sinner? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) laughed spitefully.
<p/>'' Have you turned the Magdalene into the true path? Driven out the seven devils, eh? So you see the miracles you were looking out for just now have come to pass!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hush, Rakitin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha answered with an aching heart. '' So you despise me now for those twenty-five roubles? I've sold my friend, you think.
<p/>But you are not Christ, you know, and I am not Judas. '' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Rakitin, I assure you I'd forgotten about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Alyosha, <div class="bookquote">``you remind me of it yourself...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>But this was the last straw for Rakitin. '' Damnation take you all and each of you!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) cried suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``why the devil did I take you up?
<p/>I don't want to know you from this time forward. Go alone, there's your road! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) turned abruptly into another street, leaving Alyosha alone in the dark.
<p/>It was very late, according to the monastery ideas, when Alyosha returned to the hermitage; the door-keeper let him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) in by a special entrance.
<p/>Alyosha came out of the town and walked across the fields to the monastery. Chapter IV. Cana Of Galilee It had struck nine o'clock--the hour of rest and repose after a day of such agitation for all.
<p/>There was no one in the cell but Father Paďssy, reading the Gospel in solitude over the coffin, and the young novice Porfiry, who, exhausted by the previous night's conversation and the disturbing incidents of the day, was sleeping the deep sound sleep of youth on the floor of the other room.
<p/>Alyosha timidly opened the door and went into the elder's cell where his (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) coffin was now standing. Though Father Paďssy heard Alyosha come in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) did not even look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) direction.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) soul was overflowing but with mingled feelings; no single sensation stood out distinctly; on the contrary, one drove out another in a slow, continual rotation.
<p/>Alyosha turned to the right from the door to the corner, fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) knees and began to pray. But there was a sweetness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) heart and, strange to say, Alyosha was not surprised at it.
<p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) saw that coffin before him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>), the hidden dead figure so precious to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>), but the weeping and poignant grief of the morning was no longer aching in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) soul.
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) came in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) fell down before the coffin as before a holy shrine, but joy, joy was glowing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) mind and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) heart.
<p/>The one window of the cell was open, the air was fresh and cool. '' So the smell must have become stronger, if they opened the window,'' thought Alyosha.
<p/>But even this thought of the smell of corruption, which had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) so awful and humiliating a few hours before, no longer made him (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) feel miserable or indignant.
<p/>Fragments of thought floated through his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) soul, flashed like stars and went out again at once, to be succeeded by others.
<p/>But yet there was reigning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) soul a sense of the wholeness of things--something steadfast and comforting--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) was aware of it himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) began quietly praying, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) soon felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) was praying almost mechanically. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) began praying ardently, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) longed to pour out his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) thankfulness and love....
<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) had begun to pray, he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) passed suddenly to something else, and sank into thought, forgetting both the prayer and what had interrupted it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) began listening to what Father Paďssy was reading, but worn out with exhaustion he (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) gradually began to doze. '' And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; '' read Father Paďssy.
<p/>'' And the mother of Jesus was there; And both Jesus was called, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) disciples, to the marriage. '' <div class="bookquote">``Marriage?
<p/>What's that?... A marriage! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>floated whirling through Alyosha's mind. '' There is happiness for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), too.... She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has gone to the feast....
<p/>No, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has not taken the knife.... That was only a tragic phrase.... Well ... tragic phrases should be forgiven, they must be.
<p/>Tragic phrases comfort the heart.... Without them, sorrow would be too heavy for men to bear. Rakitin has gone off to the back alley.
<p/>As long as Rakitin broods over his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) wrongs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) will always go off to the back alley.... But the high road ...
<p/>The road is wide and straight and bright as crystal, and the sun is at the end of it.... Ah!... What's being read?''...
<p/>'' And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>), They have no wine '' ... Alyosha heard.
<p/>'' Ah, yes, I was missing that, and I didn't want to miss it , I love that passage: it's Cana of Galilee, the first miracle
<p/>.... Ah, that miracle! Ah, that sweet miracle! It was not men's grief, but their joy Christ visited, He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) worked His (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) first miracle to help men's gladness... '
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) who loves men loves their gladness, too' ... He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was always repeating that, it was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) leading ideas... '
<p/>There's no living without joy,' Mitya says.... Yes, Mitya... ' Everything that is true and good is always full of forgiveness,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) used to say that, too'' ...
<p/>'' Jesus saith unto her (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>), Woman, what has it to do with thee or me? Mine hour is not yet come.
<p/>'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) saith unto you, do it '' ... <div class="bookquote">``Do it.... Gladness, the gladness of some poor, very poor, people....
<p/>The historians write that, in those days, the people living about the Lake of Gennesaret were the poorest that can possibly be imagined ... and another great heart, that other great being, His (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) Mother, knew that He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) had come not only to make His (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) great terrible sacrifice.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) knew that His (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) heart was open even to the simple, artless merrymaking of some obscure and unlearned people, who had warmly bidden Him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) to their poor wedding. '
<p/>Of course they were poor, since they hadn't wine enough even at a wedding.... Mine hour is not yet come,' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) said, with a soft smile -LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) must have smiled gently to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>)-RRB-.
<p/>And, indeed, was it to make wine abundant at poor weddings He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) had come down to earth? And yet He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) went and did as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) asked Him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>)....

<p/>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) saith unto them, Draw out now and bear unto the governor of the feast. And they bare it.
<p/>When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was; -LRB-but the servants which drew the water knew;-RRB- the governor of the feast called the bridegroom, '' And saith unto him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>), Every man at the beginning doth set forth good wine; and when men have well drunk, that which is worse; but thou hast kept the good wine until now. ''
<p/>'' '' But what's this, what's this? Why is the room growing wider?... Ah, yes ... It's the marriage, the wedding ...
<p/>yes, of course. Here are the guests, here are the young couple sitting, and the merry crowd and ... Where is the wise governor of the feast?
<p/>But who is this? Who? Again the walls are receding.... Who is getting up there from the great table? What!... He (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) here, too?
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>)'s in the coffin ... but he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>)'s here, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) has stood up, he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) sees me, he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) is coming here....
<p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>), to him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>), the little, thin old man, with tiny wrinkles on his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) face, joyful and laughing softly.
<p/>There was no coffin now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) was in the same dress as he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) had worn yesterday sitting with them, when the visitors had gathered about him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>).
<p/>God!'' ... His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face was uncovered, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes were shining. How was this, then? He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), too, had been called to the feast.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), too, at the marriage of Cana in Galilee... '' Yes, my dear, I am called, too, called and bidden,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heard a soft voice saying over him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>'' Why have you hidden yourself here, out of sight? You come and join us too. '' It was his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) voice, the voice of Father Zossima.
<p/>And it must be he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), since he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)! The elder raised Alyosha by the hand and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knees.
<p/>'' We are rejoicing,'' the little, thin old man went on. '' We are drinking the new wine, the wine of new, great gladness; do you see how many guests?
<p/>Here are the bride and bridegroom, here is the wise governor of the feast, he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) is tasting the new wine. Why do you wonder at me?
<p/>I gave an onion to a beggar, so I, too, am here. And many here have given only an onion each--only one little onion....
<p/>And you, my gentle one, you, my kind boy, you too have known how to give a famished woman an onion to-day.
<p/>What are all our deeds? Begin your work, dear one, begin it, gentle one!... Do you see our Sun, do you see Him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid ... I dare not look,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>whispered Alyosha. '' Do not fear Him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has made Himself like unto us from love and rejoices with us. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is changing the water into wine that the gladness of the guests may not be cut short.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is expecting new guests, He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is calling new ones unceasingly for ever and ever.... There they are bringing new wine.
<p/>Do you see they are bringing the vessels... '' Something glowed in Alyosha's heart, something filled it till it ached, tears of rapture rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) soul....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands, uttered a cry and waked up. Again the coffin, the open window, and the soft, solemn, distinct reading of the Gospel.
<p/>It was strange, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had fallen asleep on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knees, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) feet, and suddenly, as though thrown forward, with three firm rapid steps he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went right up to the coffin.
<p/>Father Paďssy raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) eyes for an instant from his (<font color='blue'><b>Paďssy</b></font>) book, but looked away again at once, seeing that something strange was happening to the boy.
<p/>Alyosha gazed for half a minute at the coffin, at the covered, motionless dead man that lay in the coffin, with the ikon on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breast and the peaked cap with the octangular cross, on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.
<p/>But Alyosha did not listen to the reading. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder brushed against Father Paďssy without his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) noticing it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had only just been hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice, and that voice was still ringing in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ears.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not stop on the steps either, but went quickly down; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul, overflowing with rapture, yearned for freedom, space, openness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was listening, still expecting other words, but suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned sharply and went out of the cell. The vault of heaven, full of soft, shining stars, stretched vast and fathomless above him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>The Milky Way ran in two pale streams from the zenith to the horizon. The fresh, motionless, still night enfolded the earth.
<p/>The white towers and golden domes of the cathedral gleamed out against the sapphire sky. The gorgeous autumn flowers, in the beds round the house, were slumbering till morning.
<p/>The silence of earth seemed to melt into the silence of the heavens. The mystery of earth was one with the mystery of the stars....
<p/>Alyosha stood, gazed, and suddenly threw himself down on the earth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) did not know why he (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) embraced it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) could not have told why he (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) longed so irresistibly to kiss it, to kiss it all.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) kissed it weeping, sobbing and watering it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) tears, and vowed passionately to love it, to love it for ever and ever.
<p/>'' Water the earth with the tears of your joy and love those tears,'' echoed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) soul. What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) weeping over?
<p/>in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) rapture he (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) was weeping even over those stars, which were shining to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) from the abyss of space, and ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) was not ashamed of that ecstasy.
<p/>There seemed to be threads from all those innumerable worlds of God, linking his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul to them, and it was trembling all over <div class="bookquote">``in contact with other worlds.
<p/>Oh! ''  (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) longed to forgive every one and for everything, and to beg forgiveness. Oh, not for himself, but for all men, for all and for everything.
<p/>But with every instant he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt clearly and, as it were, tangibly, that something firm and unshakable as that vault of heaven had entered into his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul.
<p/>It was as though some idea had seized the sovereignty of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mind--and it was for all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) life and for ever and ever.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had fallen on the earth a weak boy, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) rose up a resolute champion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knew and felt it suddenly at the very moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ecstasy.
<p/>'' And others are praying for me too,'' echoed again in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul. And never, never, all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) life long, could Alyosha forget that minute.
<p/>Within three days he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) left the monastery in accordance with the words of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) elder, who had bidden him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``sojourn in the world.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Some one visited my soul in that hour,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) used to say afterwards, with implicit faith in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) words. ''
<p/>Mitya Chapter I. Kuzma Samsonov But Dmitri, to whom Grushenka, flying away to a new life, had left her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) last greetings, bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) remember the hour of her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) love for ever, knew nothing of what had happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and was at that moment in a condition of feverish agitation and activity.
<p/>For the last two days he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) had been in such an inconceivable state of mind that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) might easily have fallen ill with brain fever, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) said himself afterwards.
<p/>Alyosha had not been able to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) the morning before, and Ivan had not succeeded in meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) at the tavern on the same day.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had spent those two days literally rushing in all directions, <div class="bookquote">``struggling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) destiny and trying to save himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) expressed it himself afterwards, and for some hours he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) even made a dash out of the town on urgent business, terrible as it was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) to lose sight of Grushenka for a moment.
<p/>All this was explained afterwards in detail, and confirmed by documentary evidence; but for the present we will only note the most essential incidents of those two terrible days immediately preceding the awful catastrophe, that broke so suddenly upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>Though Grushenka had, it is true, loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) for an hour, genuinely and sincerely, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) sometimes cruelly and mercilessly.
<p/>Book VIII. The people at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) lodgings, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) orders, concealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) movements. The worst of it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) could never tell what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) meant to do.
<p/>To prevail upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) by force or kindness was also impossible: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) would yield to nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) would only have become angry and turned away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) altogether, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) knew that well already.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) suspected, quite correctly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), too, was passing through an inward struggle, and was in a state of extraordinary indecision, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was making up her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) mind to something, and unable to determine upon it.
<p/>And so, not without good reason, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) divined, with a sinking heart, that at moments she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) must simply hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) passion.
<p/>And so, perhaps, it was, but what was distressing Grushenka he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) did not understand. For him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) the whole tormenting question lay between him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) and Fyodor Pavlovitch.
<p/>one certain fact: he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was firmly persuaded that Fyodor Pavlovitch would offer, or perhaps had offered, Grushenka lawful wedlock, and did not for a moment believe that the old voluptuary hoped to gain his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) object for three thousand roubles.
<p/>That was how it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) could believe at times that all Grushenka's uneasiness rose from not knowing which of them to choose, which was most to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) advantage.
<p/>Strange to say, during those days it never occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) to think of the approaching return of the <div class="bookquote">``officer,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>that is, of the man who had been such a fatal influence in Grushenka's life, and whose arrival she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was expecting with such emotion and dread.
<p/>Here, we must note, by the way, Mitya had reached this conclusion from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) knowledge of Grushenka and her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) character. It is true that of late Grushenka had been very silent about it.
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was perfectly aware of a letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had received a month ago from her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) seducer, and had heard of it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) own lips.
<p/>In a moment of spite Grushenka had shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) that letter, but to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) astonishment he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) attached hardly any consequence to it.
<p/>Perhaps, weighed down by all the hideous horror of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) struggle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) own father for this woman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was incapable of imagining any danger more terrible, at any rate for the time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) simply did not believe in a suitor who suddenly turned up again after five years' disappearance, still less in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) speedy arrival.
<p/>Moreover, in the <div class="bookquote">``officer's''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>first letter which had been shown to Mitya, the possibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) new rival's visit was very vaguely suggested.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) partly knew, too, what the letter contained. It would be hard to say why this was. The letter was very indefinite, high-flown, and full of sentimentality.
<p/>It must be noted that Grushenka had concealed from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) the last lines of the letter, in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) return was alluded to more definitely.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had, besides, noticed at that moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) remembered afterwards, a certain involuntary proud contempt for this missive from Siberia on Grushenka's face.
<p/>Grushenka told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) nothing of what had passed later between her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) and this rival; so that by degrees he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had completely forgotten the officer's existence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) felt that whatever might come later, whatever turn things might take, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) final conflict with Fyodor Pavlovitch was close upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), and must be decided before anything else.
<p/>With a sinking heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was expecting every moment Grushenka's decision, always believing that it would come suddenly, on the impulse of the moment.
<p/>All of a sudden she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Take me, I'm yours for ever,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and it would all be over.
<p/>Oh, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) would bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) away at once, as far, far away as possible; to the farthest end of Russia, if not of the earth, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) would marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), and settle down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) incognito, so that no one would know anything about them, there, here, or anywhere.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) would seize her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) and bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) away at once to the ends of the earth. Then, oh, then, a new life would begin at once!
<p/>Of this different, reformed and <div class="bookquote">``virtuous''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>life -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``it must, it must be virtuous'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) dreamed feverishly at every moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) thirsted for that reformation and renewal.
<p/>The filthy morass, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had sunk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) own free will, was too revolting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), and, like very many men in such cases, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) put faith above all in change of place.
<p/>If only it were not for these people, if only it were not for these circumstances, if only he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) could fly away from this accursed place--he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) would be altogether regenerated, would enter on a new path.
<p/>That was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) believed in, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was yearning for. But all this could only be on condition of the first, the happy solution of the question.
<p/>There was another possibility, a different and awful ending. Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) might say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Go away. I have just come to terms with Fyodor Pavlovitch.
<p/>I am going to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) and don't want you'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--and then ... but then.... But Mitya did not know what would happen then.
<p/>Up to the last hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) didn't know. That must be said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) credit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had no definite intentions, had planned no crime.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was simply watching and spying in agony, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) prepared himself for the first, happy solution of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) destiny. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) drove away any other idea, in fact.
<p/>But for that ending a quite different anxiety arose, a new, incidental, but yet fatal and insoluble difficulty presented itself. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) were to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``I'm yours; take me away,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) take her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) away?
<p/>It was just at this time that all sources of revenue from Fyodor Pavlovitch, doles which had gone on without interruption for so many years, ceased.
<p/>Grushenka had money, of course, but with regard to this Mitya suddenly evinced extraordinary pride; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wanted to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) away and begin the new life with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) himself, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) own expense, not at hers.
<p/>Where had he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) the means, the money to do it? He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) could not conceive of taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) money, and the very idea caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) a pang of intense repulsion.
<p/>I won't enlarge on this fact or analyze it here, but confine myself to remarking that this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) attitude at the moment.
<p/>All this may have arisen indirectly and unconsciously from the secret stings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) conscience for the money of Katerina Ivanovna that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had dishonestly appropriated.
<p/>I've been a scoundrel to one of them, and I shall be a scoundrel again to the other directly,'' was his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) feeling then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) explained after: <div class="bookquote">``and when Grushenka knows, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) won't care for such a scoundrel.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Where then was he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) to get the means, where was he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) to get the fateful money? Without it, all would be lost and nothing could be done, <div class="bookquote">``and only because I hadn't the money.
<p/>Oh, the shame of it! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>To anticipate things: he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) did, perhaps, know where to get the money, knew, perhaps, where it lay at that moment.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) chief trouble, I must explain however obscurely, lay in the fact that to have that sum he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) knew of, to have the right to take it, he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) must first restore Katerina Ivanovna's three thousand--if not,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm a common pickpocket, I'm a scoundrel, and I don't want to begin a new life as a scoundrel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Katerina</b></font>)</div>Mitya decided.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mind to move heaven and earth to return Katerina Ivanovna that three thousand, and that first of all .
<p/>The final stage of this decision, so to say, had been reached only during the last hours, that is, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) last interview with Alyosha, two days before, on the high-road, on the evening when Grushenka had insulted Katerina Ivanovna, and Mitya, after hearing Alyosha's account of it, had admitted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was a scoundrel, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to tell Katerina Ivanovna so, if it could be any comfort to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>After parting from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) brother on that night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) frenzy that it would be better <div class="bookquote">``to murder and rob some one than fail to pay my debt to Katya.
<p/>every one thought me a robber and a murderer, I'd rather go to Siberia than that Katya should have the right to say that I deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) and stole her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) money, and used her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) money to run away with Grushenka and begin a new life!
<p/>I will say no more of this here, as it will all be clear later. I'd rather That I can't do!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So Mitya decided, grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) teeth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) might well fancy at times that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) brain would give way. But meanwhile he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went on struggling....
<p/>Strange to say, though one would have supposed there was nothing left for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) but despair--for what chance had he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), with nothing in the world, to raise such a sum?--yet to the very end he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) persisted in hoping that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would get that three thousand, that the money would somehow come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) of itself, as though it might drop from heaven.
<p/>That is just how it is with people who, like Dmitri, have never had anything to do with money, except to squander what has come to them by inheritance without any effort of their own, and have no notion how money is obtained.
<p/>A whirl of the most fantastic notions took possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) brain immediately after he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had parted with Alyosha two days before, and threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) thoughts into a tangle of confusion.
<p/>And perhaps to men of that kind in such circumstances the most impossible, fantastic schemes occur first, and seem most practical.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) suddenly determined to go to Samsonov, the merchant who was Grushenka's protector, and to propose a <div class="bookquote">``scheme''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka protector</b></font>)</div>to him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>), and by means of it to obtain from him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) at once the whole of the sum required.
<p/>Of the commercial value of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) scheme he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) had no doubt, not the slightest, and was only uncertain how Samsonov would look upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) freak, supposing he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) were to consider it from any but the commercial point of view.
<p/>Though Mitya knew the merchant by sight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was not acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) and had never spoken a word to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>But for some unknown reason he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had long entertained the conviction that the old reprobate, who was lying at death's door, would perhaps not at all object now to Grushenka's securing a respectable position, and marrying a man <div class="bookquote">``to be depended upon.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed not only that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not object, but that this was what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desired, and, if opportunity arose, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be ready to help.
<p/>From some rumor, or perhaps from some stray word of Grushenka's, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gathered further that the old man would perhaps prefer him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to Fyodor Pavlovitch for Grushenka.
<p/>Possibly many of the readers of my novel will feel that in reckoning on such assistance, and being ready to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) bride, so to speak, from the hands of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) protector, Dmitri showed great coarseness and want of delicacy.
<p/>This is how it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) pitched first on a perfectly wild enterprise. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>I will only observe that Mitya looked upon Grushenka's past as something completely over.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) looked on that past with infinite pity and resolved with all the fervor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) passion that when once Grushenka told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) and would marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), it would mean the beginning of a new Grushenka and a new Dmitri, free from every vice.
<p/>As for Kuzma Samsonov, Dmitri looked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) as a man who had exercised a fateful influence in that remote past of Grushenka's, though she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had never loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), and who was now himself a thing of the past, completely done with, and, so to say, non-existent.
<p/>Besides, Mitya hardly looked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) as a man at all, for it was known to every one in the town that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was only a shattered wreck, whose relations with Grushenka had changed their character and were now simply paternal, and that this had been so for a long time.
<p/>In any case there was much simplicity on Mitya's part in all this, for in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) vices, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was a very simple-hearted man.
<p/>It was an instance of this simplicity that Mitya was seriously persuaded that, being on the eve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) departure for the next world, old Kuzma must sincerely repent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) past relations with Grushenka, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had no more devoted friend and protector in the world than this, now harmless old man.
<p/>After his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conversation with Alyosha, at the cross-roads, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hardly slept all night, and at ten o'clock next morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was at the house of Samsonov and telling the servant to announce him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>).
<p/>They would forgive one another and would begin their lives afresh. It was a very large and gloomy old house of two stories, with a lodge and outhouses.
<p/>In the lower story lived Samsonov's two married sons with their families, his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) old sister, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) unmarried daughter. In the lodge lived two of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) clerks, one of whom also had a large family.
<p/>Both the lodge and the lower story were overcrowded, but the old man kept the upper floor to himself, and would not even let the daughter live there with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) waited upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) asthma was obliged at certain fixed hours, and at any time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might call her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), to run upstairs to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from below.
<p/>This upper floor contained a number of large rooms kept purely for show, furnished in the old-fashioned merchant style, with long monotonous rows of clumsy mahogany chairs along the walls, with glass chandeliers under shades, and gloomy mirrors on the walls.
<p/>All these rooms were entirely empty and unused, for the old man kept to one room, a small, remote bedroom, where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was waited upon by an old servant with a kerchief on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) head, and by a lad, who used to sit on the locker in the passage.
<p/>Owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) swollen legs, the old man could hardly walk at all, and was only rarely lifted from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leather arm-chair, when the old woman supporting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) led him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up and down the room once or twice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was morose and taciturn even with this old woman. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was informed of the arrival of the <div class="bookquote">``captain,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at once refused to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>But Mitya persisted and sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) name up again. Samsonov questioned the lad minutely: What he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) looked like? Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) was drunk?
<p/>Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) going to make a row? The answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) received was: that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) was sober, but wouldn't go away. The old man again refused to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Then Mitya, who had foreseen this, and purposely brought pencil and paper with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), wrote clearly on the piece of paper the words:
<p/>After thinking a little Samsonov told the lad to take the visitor to the drawing-room, and sent the old woman downstairs with a summons to his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) younger son to come upstairs to him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) at once.
<p/>This younger son, a man over six foot and of exceptional physical strength, who was closely-shaven and dressed in the European style, though his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father still wore a kaftan and a beard, came at once without a comment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``On most important business closely concerning Agrafena Alexandrovna,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>and sent it up to the old man. All the family trembled before the father.
<p/>'' -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was by no means of a timorous temper-RRB-, but in order to have a witness in case of any emergency.
<p/>The old man had sent for this giant, not because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was afraid of the <div class="bookquote">``captain Supported by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son and the servant-lad, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waddled at last into the drawing-room.
<p/>The drawing-room in which Mitya was awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was a vast, dreary room that laid a weight of depression on the heart.
<p/>It had a double row of windows, a gallery, marbled walls, and three immense chandeliers with glass lusters covered with shades.
<p/>It may be assumed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) felt considerable curiosity. Mitya was sitting on a little chair at the entrance, awaiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) fate with nervous impatience.
<p/>When the old man appeared at the opposite door, seventy feet away, Mitya jumped up at once, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) long, military stride walked to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>Mitya was well dressed, in a frock-coat, buttoned up, with a round hat and black gloves in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had been three days before at the elder's, at the family meeting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father and brothers.
<p/>The old man waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), standing dignified and unbending, and Mitya felt at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had looked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) through and through as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) advanced.
<p/>Mitya was greatly impressed, too, with Samsonov's immensely swollen face. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) lower lip, which had always been thick, hung down now, looking like a bun.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) bowed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) guest in dignified silence, motioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to a low chair by the sofa, and, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) son's arm he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) began lowering himself on to the sofa opposite, groaning painfully, so that Mitya, seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) painful exertions, immediately felt remorseful and sensitively conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) insignificance in the presence of the dignified person he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had ventured to disturb.
<p/>What is it you want of me, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the old man, deliberately, distinctly, severely, but courteously, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was at last seated.
<p/>'' Mitya started, leapt up, but sat down again. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) began at once speaking with loud, nervous haste, gesticulating, and in a positive frenzy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was unmistakably a man driven into a corner, on the brink of ruin, catching at the last straw, ready to sink if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) failed.
<p/>Most honored sir, Kuzma Kuzmitch, you have no doubt heard more than once of my disputes with my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, who robbed me of my inheritance from my mother ... seeing the whole town is gossiping about it ... for here every one's gossiping of what they shouldn't ... and besides, it might have reached you through Grushenka ...
<p/>Old Samsonov probably grasped all this in an instant, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) face remained cold and immovable as a statue's. '' I beg your pardon, through Agrafena Alexandrovna ...
<p/>Agrafena Alexandrovna, the lady for whom I have the highest respect and esteem ...'' So Mitya began, and broke down at the first sentence.
<p/>Three months ago, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had of express intention -LRB-Mitya purposely used these words instead of <div class="bookquote">``intentionally'' (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>-RRB- consulted a lawyer in the chief town of the province, <div class="bookquote">``a distinguished lawyer, Kuzma Kuzmitch, Pavel Pavlovitch Korneplodov.
<p/>We will not reproduce his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavel</b></font>) speech word for word, but will only summarize the gist of it. You have perhaps heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavel</b></font>)?
<p/>A man of vast intellect, the mind of a statesman ... he (<font color='blue'><b>statesman</b></font>) knows you, too ... spoke of you in the highest terms ...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a lawyer lawyer</b></font>)</div>Mitya broke down again. But these breaks did not deter him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) leapt instantly over the gaps, and struggled on and on.
<p/>This Korneplodov, after questioning him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) minutely, and inspecting the documents he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was able to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) -LRB-Mitya alluded somewhat vaguely to these documents, and slurred over the subject with special haste-RRB-, reported that they certainly might take proceedings concerning the village of Tchermashnya, which ought, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said, to have come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), Mitya, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mother, and so checkmate the old villain, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father ... ``because every door was not closed and justice might still find a loophole.
<p/>In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) might reckon on an additional sum of six or even seven thousand roubles from Fyodor Pavlovitch, as Tchermashnya was worth, at least, twenty-five thousand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) might say twenty-eight thousand, in fact, <div class="bookquote">``thirty, thirty, Kuzma Kuzmitch, and would you believe it, I didn't get seventeen from that heartless man!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Mitya, had thrown the business up, for the time, knowing nothing about the law, but on coming here was struck dumb by a cross-claim made upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) -LRB-here Mitya went adrift again and again took a flying leap forward-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``so will not you, excellent and honored Kuzma Kuzmitch, be willing to take up all my claims against that unnatural monster, and pay me a sum down of only three thousand?...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>You see, you cannot, in any case, lose over it. On my honor, my honor, I swear that. Quite the contrary, you may make six or seven thousand instead of three.
<p/>I'll do the business with you at a notary's, or whatever it is ... in fact, I'm ready to do anything....
<p/>whatever you want, sign anything ... and we could draw up the agreement at once ... and if it were possible, if it were only possible, that very morning....
<p/>You could pay me that three thousand, for there isn't a capitalist in this town to compare with you, and so would save me from ...
<p/>'' Above all, he (<font color='blue'><b>capitalist</b></font>) wanted this concluded that very day. '' I'll hand over all the deeds ... would save me, in fact ... for a good, I might say an honorable action....
<p/>For I cherish the most honorable feelings for a certain person, whom you know well, and care for as a father.
<p/>I would not have come, indeed, if it had not been as a father. And, indeed, it's a struggle of three in this business, for it's fate
<p/>--that's a fearful thing, Kuzma Kuzmitch! A tragedy, Kuzma Kuzmitch, a tragedy! And as you've dropped out long ago, it's a tug- of-war between two.
<p/>I'm expressing it awkwardly, perhaps, but I'm not a literary man. You see, I'm on the one side, and that monster on the other.
<p/>So you must choose. It's either I or the monster. It all lies in your hands--the fate of three lives, and the happiness of two....
<p/>Excuse me, I'm making a mess of it, but you understand ... I see from your venerable eyes that you understand ...
<p/>Mitya broke off his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) clumsy speech with that, <div class="bookquote">``so you see!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>and jumping up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seat, awaited the answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) foolish proposal.
<p/>At the last phrase he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had suddenly become hopelessly aware that it had all fallen flat, above all, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had been talking utter nonsense.
<p/>and if you don't understand, I'm done for ... so you see!'' '' How strange it is! On the way here it seemed all right, and now it's nothing but nonsense.
<p/>All the while he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had been talking, the old man sat motionless, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with an icy expression in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>After keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for a moment in suspense, Kuzma Kuzmitch pronounced at last in the most positive and chilling tone: <div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, we don't undertake such business.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Kuzma Kuzmitch</b></font>)</div>The idea suddenly dawned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>) despairing mind. '' Mitya suddenly felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) legs growing weak under him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). '' What am I to do now, Kuzma Kuzmitch?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>) muttered, with a pale smile. '' I suppose it's all up with me--what do you think? '' <div class="bookquote">``Excuse me...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div><p/>Mitya remained standing, staring motionless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) suddenly noticed a movement in the old man's face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) started. '' You see, sir, business of that sort's not in our line,'' said the old man slowly.
<p/>'' There's the court, and the lawyers--it's a perfect misery. But if you like, there is a man here you might apply to.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Good heavens! Who is it? You're my salvation, Kuzma Kuzmitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>faltered Mitya. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) doesn't live here, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s not here just now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is a peasant, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) does business in timber. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) name is Lyagavy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s been haggling with Fyodor Pavlovitch for the last year, over your copse at Tchermashnya.
<p/>They can't agree on the price, maybe you've heard? Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>)'s come back again and is staying with the priest at Ilyinskoe, about twelve versts from the Volovya station.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) wrote to me, too, about the business of the copse, asking my advice. Fyodor Pavlovitch means to go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) himself.
<p/>So if you were to be beforehand with Fyodor Pavlovitch and to make Lyagavy the offer you've made me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) might possibly--'' <div class="bookquote">``A brilliant idea!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>)'s haggling with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) for it, being asked too much, and here he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) would have all the documents entitling him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) to the property itself.
<p/>Mitya interrupted ecstatically. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s the very man, it would just suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). Ha ha ha! '' And Mitya suddenly went off into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) short, wooden laugh, startling Samsonov.
<p/>'' How can I thank you, Kuzma Kuzmitch? '' cried Mitya effusively. '' Don't mention it,'' said Samsonov, inclining his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) head.
<p/>'' But you don't know, you've saved me. Oh, it was a true presentiment brought me to you.... So now to this priest!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No need of thanks. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll make haste and fly there. I'm afraid I've overtaxed your strength. I shall never forget it.
<p/>It's a Russian says that, Kuzma Kuzmitch, a R-r- russian!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' To be sure!'' Mitya seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hand to press it, but there was a malignant gleam in the old man's eye.
<p/>Mitya drew back his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hand, but at once blamed himself for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mistrustfulness. '' It's because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s tired,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) thought. ''
<p/>For her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) sake! For her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) sake, Kuzma Kuzmitch! You understand that it's for her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>),'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>) cried, his (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>) voice ringing through the room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>) bowed, turned sharply round, and with the same long stride walked to the door without looking back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>) was trembling with delight.
<p/>'' Everything was on the verge of ruin and my guardian angel saved me,'' was the thought in his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) mind. And if such a business man as Samsonov -LRB-a most worthy old man, and what dignity!-RRB-
<p/>had suggested this course, then ... then success was assured. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) would fly off immediately. '' I will be back before night, I shall be back at night and the thing is done.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) could, of course, imagine nothing, but that the advice was practical <div class="bookquote">``from such a business man''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>with an understanding of the business, with an understanding of this Lyagavy -LRB-curious surname!-RRB-.
<p/>Could the old man have been laughing at me? '' exclaimed Mitya, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) strode towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) lodging. Or--the old man was laughing at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Long afterwards, when the catastrophe had happened, old Samsonov himself confessed, laughing, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) had made a fool of the <div class="bookquote">``captain.
<p/>Alas! The second alternative was the correct one. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a fool</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) was a cold, spiteful and sarcastic man, liable to violent antipathies.
<p/>Whether it was the <div class="bookquote">``captain's''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>excited face, or the foolish conviction of the <div class="bookquote">``rake and spendthrift,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), Samsonov, could be taken in by such a cock-and-bull story as his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) scheme, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) jealousy of Grushenka, in whose name this <div class="bookquote">``scapegrace''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>had rushed in on him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) with such a tale to get money which worked on the old man, I can't tell.
<p/>But at the instant when Mitya stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) legs grow weak under him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), and frantically exclaiming that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was ruined, at that moment the old man looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with intense spite, and resolved to make a laughing-stock of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>When Mitya had gone, Kuzma Kuzmitch, white with rage, turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>) son and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>) see to it that that beggar be never seen again, and never admitted even into the yard, or else he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>)'d-- He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) did not utter his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) threat.
<p/>For a whole hour afterwards, the old man was shaking with anger, and by evening he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was worse, and sent for the doctor.
<p/>But even his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son, who often saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enraged, trembled with fear. Chapter II. Lyagavy So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must drive at full speed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not the money for horses.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had forty kopecks, and that was all, all that was left after so many years of prosperity! But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had at home an old silver watch which had long ceased to go.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) snatched it up and carried it to a Jewish watchmaker who had a shop in the market-place. The Jew gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) six roubles for it.
<p/>'' And I didn't expect that,'' cried Mitya, ecstatically. -LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was still in a state of ecstasy.-RRB- He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) six roubles and ran home.
<p/>At home he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) borrowed three roubles from the people of the house, who loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) so much that they were pleased to give it him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), though it was all they had.
<p/>Mitya in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) excitement told them on the spot that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) fate would be decided that day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) described, in desperate haste, the whole scheme he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had put before Samsonov, the latter's decision, his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) own hopes for the future, and so on.
<p/>These people had been told many of their lodger's secrets before, and so looked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) as a gentleman who was not at all proud, and almost one of themselves.
<p/>This was how the fact came to be remembered and established that <div class="bookquote">``at midday, on the day before the event, Mitya had not a farthing, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had sold his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) watch to get money and had borrowed three roubles from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) landlord, all in the presence of witnesses.
<p/>Having thus collected nine roubles Mitya sent for posting-horses to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to the Volovya station. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I note this fact, later on it will be apparent why I do so.
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was radiant with the joyful anticipation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would at last solve all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) difficulties, yet, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) drew near Volovya station, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) trembled at the thought of what Grushenka might be doing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) absence.
<p/>This was why he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had gone off without telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) and why he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) left orders with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) landlady not to let out where he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had gone, if any one came to inquire for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>What if she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) mind to-day to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch? '' I must, I must get back to-night,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) repeated, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was jolted along in the cart, <div class="bookquote">``and
<p/>I dare say I shall have to bring this Lyagavy back here ... to draw up the deed. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So mused Mitya, with a throbbing heart, but alas!
<p/>To begin with, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was late, taking a short cut from Volovya station which turned out to be eighteen versts instead of twelve.
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) dreams were not fated to be carried out. Secondly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) did not find the priest at home at Ilyinskoe; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had gone off to a neighboring village.
<p/>The priest, a shy and amiable looking little man, informed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at once that though Lyagavy had been staying with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at first, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was now at Suhoy Possyolok, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was staying the night in the forester's cottage, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was buying timber there too.
<p/>At Mitya's urgent request that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would take him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to Lyagavy at once, and by so doing <div class="bookquote">``save him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), so to speak,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lyagavy</b></font>)</div>the priest agreed, after some demur, to conduct him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) to Suhoy Possyolok; his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) curiosity was obviously aroused.
<p/>While Mitya, setting off there with the same exhausted horses, was looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), it was almost dark. But, unluckily, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) advised their going on foot, as it would not be <div class="bookquote">``much over''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>a verst.
<p/>Mitya, of course, agreed, and marched off with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) yard-long strides, so that the poor priest almost ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was a very cautious man, though not old.
<p/>Mitya at once began talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), too, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) plans, nervously and excitedly asking advice in regard to Lyagavy, and talking all the way.
<p/>The priest listened attentively, but gave little advice. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) turned off Mitya's questions with: ``I don't know. Ah, I can't say.
<p/>When Mitya began to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) quarrel with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father over his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) inheritance, the priest was positively alarmed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was in some way dependent on Fyodor Pavlovitch.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) inquired, however, with surprise, why he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) called the peasant-trader Gorstkin, Lyagavy, and obligingly explained to Mitya that, though the man's name really was Lyagavy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was never called so, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would be grievously offended at the name, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) must be sure to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) Gorstkin, <div class="bookquote">``or you'll do nothing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) won't even listen to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gorstkin</b></font>)</div>said the priest in conclusion.
<p/>How can I tell?'' and so on. Mitya was somewhat surprised for a moment, and explained that that was what Samsonov had called him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>).
<p/>On hearing this fact, the priest dropped the subject, though he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) would have done well to put into words his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) doubt whether, if Samsonov had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) to that peasant, calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) Lyagavy, there was not something wrong about it
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) hurried, striding along, and only when he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) reached Suhoy Possyolok did he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) realize that they had come not one verst, nor one and a half, but at least three.
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) was turning him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) into ridicule. But Mitya had no time to pause over such trifles. This annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) controlled himself.
<p/>They went into the hut. The forester lived in one half of the hut, and Gorstkin was lodging in the other,
<p/>the better room the other side of the passage. They went into that room and lighted a tallow candle. The hut was extremely overheated.
<p/>On the table there was a samovar that had gone out, a tray with cups, an empty rum bottle, a bottle of vodka partly full, and some half-eaten crusts of wheaten bread.
<p/>The visitor himself lay stretched at full length on the bench, with his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) coat crushed up under his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) head for a pillow, snoring heavily.
<p/>Mitya stood in perplexity. '' Of course I must wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). My business is too important. I've come in such haste.
<p/>I'm in a hurry to get back to-day,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said in great agitation. But the priest and the forester stood in silence, not giving their opinion.
<p/>Mitya went up and began trying to wake him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) tried vigorously, but the sleeper did not wake. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s drunk,'' Mitya decided.
<p/>And, terribly impatient, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) began pulling him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) by the arms, by the legs, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head, lifting him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) up and making him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sit on the bench.
<p/>Yet, after prolonged exertions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) could only succeed in getting the drunken man to utter absurd grunts, and violent, but inarticulate oaths.
<p/>'' Good Lord! What am I to do? What am I to do? '' '' No, you'd better wait a little,'' the priest pronounced at last, <div class="bookquote">``for he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)'s obviously not in a fit state.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the priest</b></font>)</div><p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)'s been drinking the whole day,'' the forester chimed in. '' Good heavens!'' cried Mitya. '' If only you knew how important it is to me and how desperate I am!''
<p/>And in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) despair he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was on the point of attacking the sleeping man again, but stopped short at once, realizing the uselessness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) efforts.
<p/>'' No, you'd better wait till morning,'' the priest repeated. '' Till morning? Mercy! that's impossible! '' The priest said nothing, the sleepy forester looked gloomy.
<p/>'' What terrible tragedies real life contrives for people,'' said Mitya, in complete despair. The perspiration was streaming down his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face.
<p/>The priest seized the moment to put before him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), very reasonably, that, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) succeeded in wakening the man, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) would still be drunk and incapable of conversation.
<p/>'' And your business is important,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``so you'd certainly better put it off till morning. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With a gesture of despair Mitya agreed.
<p/>'' Father, I will stay here with a light, and seize the favorable moment. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wakes I'll begin.
<p/>I'll pay you for the light,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said to the forester, <div class="bookquote">``for the night's lodging, too; you'll remember Dmitri Karamazov. Only, Father, I don't know what we're to do with you.
<p/>Where will you sleep?''  (<font color='red'><b>the forester</b></font>)</div>'' No, I'm going home. I'll take his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) horse and get home,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said, indicating the forester.
<p/>The priest rode off on the forester's horse, delighted to escape, though he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) head uneasily, wondering whether he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) ought not next day to inform his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) benefactor Fyodor Pavlovitch of this curious incident, ``or he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) may in an unlucky hour hear of it, be angry, and withdraw his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) favor.
<p/>The forester, scratching himself, went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>forester</b></font>) room without a word, and Mitya sat on the bench to <div class="bookquote">``catch the favorable moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) expressed it.
<p/>'' And now I'll say good-by. I wish you all success. '' So it was settled. '' Profound dejection clung about his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) soul like a heavy mist.
<p/>A profound, intense dejection! He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sat thinking, but could reach no conclusion. The candle burnt dimly, a cricket chirped; it became insufferably close in the overheated room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) suddenly pictured the garden, the path behind the garden, the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father's house mysteriously opening and Grushenka running in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) leapt up from the bench. '' It's a tragedy! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said, grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) teeth. Mechanically he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went up to the sleeping man and looked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was a lean, middle-aged peasant, with a very long face, flaxen curls, and a long, thin, reddish beard, wearing a blue cotton shirt and a black waistcoat, from the pocket of which peeped the chain of a silver watch.
<p/>What was insufferably humiliating was, that after leaving things of such importance and making such sacrifices, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), Mitya, utterly worn out, should with business of such urgency be standing over this dolt on whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) whole fate depended, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) snored as though there were nothing the matter, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'d dropped from another planet.
<p/>Mitya looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face with intense hatred, and for some unknown reason his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) curly hair particularly irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). '' Oh, the irony of fate!'' cried Mitya, and, quite losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) fell again to rousing the tipsy peasant.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) roused him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) with a sort of ferocity, pulled at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), even beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>); but after five minutes of vain exertions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) bench in helpless despair, and sat down.
<p/>'' Stupid! Stupid! '' cried Mitya. '' And how dishonorable it all is! '' something made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) add. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head began to ache horribly.
<p/>'' Should he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) fling it up and go away altogether? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wondered. '' No, wait till to-morrow now. I'll stay on purpose.
<p/>What else did I come for? Besides, I've no means of going. How am I to get away from here now?
<p/>Oh, the idiocy of it! '' But his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head ached more and more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sat without moving, and unconsciously dozed off and fell asleep as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seemed to have slept for two hours or more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was waked up by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head aching so unbearably that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) could have screamed.
<p/>There was a hammering in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) temples, and the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head ached. It was a long time before he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) could wake up fully and understand what had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) realized that the room was full of charcoal fumes from the stove, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) might die of suffocation.
<p/>And the drunken peasant still lay snoring. The candle guttered and was about to go out. Mitya cried out, and ran staggering across the passage into the forester's room.
<p/>The forester waked up at once, but hearing that the other room was full of fumes, to Mitya's surprise and annoyance, accepted the fact with strange unconcern, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) did go to see to it.
<p/>'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s dead! and ... what am I to do then? '' cried Mitya frantically. They threw open the doors, opened a window and the chimney.
<p/>First he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wetted his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) own head, then, finding a rag of some sort, dipped it into the water, and put it on Lyagavy's head.
<p/>Mitya brought a pail of water from the passage. The forester still treated the matter contemptuously, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) opened the window said grumpily: <div class="bookquote">``It'll be all right, now.
<p/>Mitya fussed about the drunken peasant for half an hour, wetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head, and gravely resolved not to sleep all night.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was so worn out that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sat down for a moment to take breath, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) eyes, unconsciously stretched himself full length on the bench and slept like the dead.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went back to sleep, leaving Mitya a lighted lantern. It was dreadfully late when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) waked. It was somewhere about nine o'clock.
<p/>The sun was shining brightly in the two little windows of the hut. The curly-headed peasant was sitting on the bench and had his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) coat on.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) had another samovar and another bottle in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>). Yesterday's bottle had already been finished, and the new one was more than half empty.
<p/>Mitya jumped up and saw at once that the cursed peasant was drunk again, hopelessly and incurably. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) for a moment with wide opened eyes.
<p/>The peasant was silently and slyly watching him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>), with insulting composure, and even a sort of contemptuous condescension, so Mitya fancied.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) rushed up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). '' Excuse me, you see ... I ... you've most likely heard from the forester here in the hut.
<p/>I'm Lieutenant Dmitri Karamazov, the son of the old Karamazov whose copse you are buying. '' '' That's a lie!'' said the peasant, calmly and confidently.
<p/>'' A lie? You know Fyodor Pavlovitch?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't know any of your Fyodor Pavlovitches,''  (<font color='red'><b>the peasant</b></font>)</div>said the peasant, speaking thickly. ''
<p/>You're bargaining with him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) for the copse, for the copse. Do wake up, and collect yourself. Father Pavel of Ilyinskoe brought me here.
<p/>You wrote to Samsonov, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) has sent me to you,'' Mitya gasped breathlessly. '' You're l-lying!'' Lyagavy blurted out again.
<p/>Mitya's legs went cold. '' For mercy's sake! It isn't a joke! You're drunk, perhaps. Yet you can speak and understand ... or else ...
<p/>I understand nothing!'' '' You're a painter!'' <div class="bookquote">``For mercy's sake! I'm Karamazov, Dmitri Karamazov. I have an offer to make you, an advantageous offer ... very advantageous offer, concerning the copse!''
 (<font color='red'><b>The peasant</b></font>)</div><p/>The peasant stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) beard importantly. '' No, you've contracted for the job and turned out a scamp. You're a scoundrel!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I assure you you're mistaken,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>cried Mitya, wringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands in despair. The peasant still stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) beard, and suddenly screwed up his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) eyes cunningly.
<p/>'' No, you show me this: you tell me the law that allows roguery. D'you hear? You're a scoundrel! Do you understand that?''
<p/>Mitya stepped back gloomily, and suddenly <div class="bookquote">``something seemed to hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) on the head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said afterwards. In an instant a light seemed to dawn in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mind, <div class="bookquote">``a light was kindled and I grasped it all.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) stood, stupefied, wondering how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), after all a man of intelligence, could have yielded to such folly, have been led into such an adventure, and have kept it up for almost twenty-four hours, fussing round this Lyagavy, wetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head.
<p/>Why, the man's drunk, dead drunk, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll go on drinking now for a week; what's the use of waiting here?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>'' And what if Samsonov sent me here on purpose? What if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)--? Oh, God, what have I done? ''
<p/>The peasant sat watching him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) and grinning. Another time Mitya might have killed the fool in a fury, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) felt as weak as a child.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went quietly to the bench, took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) overcoat, put it on without a word, and went out of the hut.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) took fifty kopecks in small change out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pocket and put them on the table for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) night's lodging, the candle, and the trouble he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had given.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) did not find the forester in the next room; there was no one there. Coming out of the hut he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) saw nothing but forest all round.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) walked at hazard, not knowing which way to turn out of the hut, to the right or to the left.
<p/>Hurrying there the evening before with the priest, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) had not noticed the road. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) had no revengeful feeling for anybody, even for Samsonov, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) strode along a narrow forest path, aimless, dazed, without heeding where he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) was going. A child could have knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) down, so weak was he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) in body and soul.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) got out of the forest somehow, however, and a vista of fields, bare after the harvest, stretched as far as the eye could see.
<p/>'' What despair! What death all round! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) repeated, striding on and on. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) was saved by meeting an old merchant who was being driven across country in a hired trap.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) overtook him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>), Mitya asked the way, and it turned out that the old merchant, too, was going to Volovya.
<p/>After some discussion Mitya got into the trap. Three hours later they arrived. At Volovya, Mitya at once ordered posting-horses to drive to the town, and suddenly realized that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was appallingly hungry.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) ate it all in an instant, ate a huge hunk of bread, ate a sausage, and swallowed three glasses of vodka.
<p/>While the horses were being harnessed, an omelette was prepared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). After eating, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) spirits and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heart grew lighter.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) flew towards the town, urged on the driver, and suddenly made a new and <div class="bookquote">``unalterable''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>plan to procure that <div class="bookquote">``accursed money''  (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div>before evening.
<p/>And to think, only to think that a man's life should be ruined for the sake of that paltry three thousand!
<p/>And if it had not been for the thought of Grushenka and of what might have happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), which never left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would perhaps have become quite cheerful again...
<p/>'' '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, contemptuously. '' I'll settle it to- day. '' But the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was stabbing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the heart every moment, like a sharp knife.
<p/>At last they arrived, and Mitya at once ran to Grushenka. Chapter III. Gold-Mines This was the visit of Mitya of which Grushenka had spoken to Rakitin with such horror.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was just then expecting the <div class="bookquote">``message,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and was much relieved that Mitya had not been to see her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that day or the day before.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hoped that <div class="bookquote">``please God he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) won't come till I'm gone away,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) suddenly burst in on her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The rest we know already.
<p/>To get him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) off her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suggested at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) should walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to Samsonov's, where she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) absolutely must go <div class="bookquote">``to settle his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) accounts,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and when Mitya accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at once, she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said good-by to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) at the gate, making him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) promise to come at twelve o'clock to take her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home again.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sitting at Samsonov's she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not be going to Fyodor Pavlovitch's, <div class="bookquote">``if only she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s not lying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) added at once.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was that sort of jealous man who, in the absence of the beloved woman, at once invents all sorts of awful fancies of what may be happening to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may be betraying him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), but, when shaken, heartbroken, convinced of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) faithlessness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) runs back to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); at the first glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gay, laughing, affectionate face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) revives at once, lays aside all suspicion and with joyful shame abuses himself for his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) jealousy.
<p/>Mitya, too, was delighted at this arrangement. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not lying from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) saw. After leaving Grushenka at the gate he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) rushed home.
<p/>Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had so much still to do that day! But a load had been lifted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heart, anyway. ''
<p/>Now I must only make haste and find out from Smerdyakov whether anything happened there last night, whether, by any chance, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went to Fyodor Pavlovitch; ough!'' floated through his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) mind.
<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had time to reach his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) lodging, jealousy had surged up again in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) restless heart. Jealousy! '' Othello was not jealous, he (<font color='blue'><b>Othello</b></font>) was trustful,'' observed Pushkin.
<p/>And that remark alone is enough to show the deep insight of our great poet. Othello's soul was shattered and his (<font color='blue'><b>Othello</b></font>) whole outlook clouded simply because his (<font color='blue'><b>Othello</b></font>) ideal was destroyed .
<p/>But Othello did not begin hiding, spying, peeping. He (<font color='blue'><b>Othello</b></font>) was trustful, on the contrary. He (<font color='blue'><b>Othello</b></font>) had to be led up, pushed on, excited with great difficulty before he (<font color='blue'><b>Othello</b></font>) could entertain the idea of deceit.
<p/>It is impossible to picture to oneself the shame and moral degradation to which the jealous man can descend without a qualm of conscience.
<p/>The truly jealous man is not like that. And yet it's not as though the jealous were all vulgar and base souls.
<p/>On the contrary, a man of lofty feelings, whose love is pure and full of self-sacrifice, may yet hide under tables, bribe the vilest people, and be familiar with the lowest ignominy of spying and eavesdropping.
<p/>Othello was incapable of making up his (<font color='blue'><b>Othello</b></font>) mind to faithlessness--not incapable of forgiving it, but of making up his (<font color='blue'><b>Othello</b></font>) mind to it--though his (<font color='blue'><b>Othello</b></font>) soul was as innocent and free from malice as a babe's.
<p/>It is hard to imagine what some jealous men can make up their mind to and overlook, and what they can forgive!
<p/>It is not so with the really jealous man. The jealous are the readiest of all to forgive, and all women know it.
<p/>The jealous man can forgive extraordinarily quickly -LRB-though, of course, after a violent scene-RRB-, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is able to forgive infidelity almost conclusively proved, the very kisses and embraces he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has seen, if only he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can somehow be convinced that it has all been <div class="bookquote">``for the last time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rival will vanish from that day forward, will depart to the ends of the earth, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself will carry her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) away somewhere, where that dreaded rival will not get near her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Of course the reconciliation is only for an hour. For, even if the rival did disappear next day, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would invent another one and would be jealous of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>And one might wonder what there was in a love that had to be so watched over, what a love could be worth that needed such strenuous guarding.
<p/>It is remarkable, too, that those very men of noble hearts, standing hidden in some cupboard, listening and spying, never feel the stings of conscience at that moment, anyway, though they understand clearly enough with their <div class="bookquote">``noble hearts''  (<font color='red'><b>those men</b></font>)</div>the shameful depths to which they have voluntarily sunk.
<p/>At the sight of Grushenka, Mitya's jealousy vanished, and, for an instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) became trustful and generous, and positively despised himself for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) evil feelings.
<p/>But it only proved that, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) love for the woman, there was an element of something far higher than he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) himself imagined, that it was not only a sensual passion, not only the <div class="bookquote">``curve of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) body,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had talked to Alyosha.
<p/>But, as soon as Grushenka had gone, Mitya began to suspect her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) of all the low cunning of faithlessness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) felt no sting of conscience at it.
<p/>But that the jealous will never understand. And yet among them are men of noble hearts. And so jealousy surged up in him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had, in any case, to make haste. The first thing to be done was to get hold of at least a small, temporary loan of money.
<p/>The nine roubles had almost all gone on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) expedition. And, as we all know, one can't take a step without money.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had a brace of fine dueling pistols in a case, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had not pawned till then because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) prized them above all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) possessions.
<p/>In the <div class="bookquote">``Metropolis''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>tavern he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had some time since made acquaintance with a young official and had learnt that this very opulent bachelor was passionately fond of weapons.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) had thought over in the cart where he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) could get a loan. He (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) used to buy pistols, revolvers, daggers, hang them on his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) wall and show them to acquaintances.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) prided himself on them, and was quite a specialist on the mechanism of the revolver. Mitya, without stopping to think, went straight to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), and offered to pawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pistols to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) for ten roubles.
<p/>But Mitya would not consent, so the young man gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) ten roubles, protesting that nothing would induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to take interest.
<p/>Mitya was in haste; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) rushed towards Fyodor Pavlovitch's by the back way, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) arbor, to get hold of Smerdyakov as soon as possible.
<p/>In this way the fact was established that three or four hours before a certain event, of which I shall speak later on, Mitya had not a farthing, and pawned for ten roubles a possession he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) valued, though, three hours later, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was in possession of thousands....
<p/>The official, delighted, began trying to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) to sell them outright. They parted friends. But I am anticipating. From Marya Kondratyevna -LRB-the woman living near Fyodor Pavlovitch's-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) learned the very disturbing fact of Smerdyakov's illness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) heard the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) fall in the cellar, his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) fit, the doctor's visit, Fyodor Pavlovitch's anxiety; he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) heard with interest, too, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) brother Ivan had set off that morning for Moscow.
<p/>'' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) must have driven through Volovya before me,'' thought Dmitri, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was terribly distressed about Smerdyakov. '' What will happen now?
<p/>Who'll keep watch for me? Who'll bring me word? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) thought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) began greedily questioning the women whether they had seen anything the evening before.
<p/>They quite understood what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was trying to find out, and completely reassured him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>). No one had been there. Ivan Fyodorovitch had been there the night; everything had been perfectly as usual.
<p/>Mitya grew thoughtful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would certainly have to keep watch to-day, but where? Here or at Samsonov's gate? He (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) decided that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) must be on the look out both here and there, and meanwhile ... meanwhile....
<p/>The difficulty was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) had to carry out the new plan that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) had made on the journey back. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) was sure of its success, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) must not delay acting upon it.
<p/>Mitya resolved to sacrifice an hour to it: <div class="bookquote">``In an hour I shall know everything, I shall settle everything, and then, then, first of all to Samsonov's.
<p/>I'll inquire whether Grushenka's there and instantly be back here again, stay till eleven, and then to Samsonov's again to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) home.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>This was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) decided. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) flew home, washed, combed his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) hair, brushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) clothes, dressed, and went to Madame Hohlakov's.
<p/>Alas! he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) had built his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) hopes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) had resolved to borrow three thousand from that lady. And what was more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) felt suddenly convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would not refuse to lend it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>).
<p/>It may be wondered why, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) felt so certain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) had not gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) at first, one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) own sort, so to speak, instead of to Samsonov, a man he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) did not know, who was not of his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) own class, and to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) hardly knew how to speak.
<p/>But the fact was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) had never known Madame Hohlakov well, and had seen nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) for the last month, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not endure him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had detested him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) from the first because he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) was engaged to Katerina Ivanovna, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had, for some reason, suddenly conceived the desire that Katerina Ivanovna should throw him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) over, and marry the ``charming, chivalrously refined Ivan, who had such excellent manners.
<p/>Mitya positively laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), and had once said about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was just as lively and at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) ease as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was uncultivated.
<p/>But that morning in the cart a brilliant idea had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is so anxious I should not marry Katerina Ivanovna''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>-LRB-and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was positively hysterical upon the subject-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) refuse me now that three thousand, just to enable me to leave Katya and get away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) for ever.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mitya's manners she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) detested. These spoilt fine ladies, if they set their hearts on anything, will spare no expense to satisfy their caprice.
<p/>As for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``plan''  (<font color='red'><b>Tchermashnya</b></font>)</div>it was just the same as before; it consisted of the offer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) rights to Tchermashnya--but not with a commercial object, as it had been with Samsonov, not trying to allure the lady with the possibility of making a profit of six or seven thousand--but simply as a security for the debt.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) worked out this new idea, Mitya was enchanted with it, but so it always was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) undertakings, in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sudden decisions.
<p/>Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s so rich,'' Mitya argued. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) gave himself up to every new idea with passionate enthusiasm. Yet, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mounted the steps of Madame Hohlakov's house he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) felt a shiver of fear run down his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) spine.
<p/>At that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) saw fully, as a mathematical certainty, that this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) last hope, that if this broke down, nothing else was left him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) in the world, but to <div class="bookquote">``rob and murder some one for the three thousand.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>It was half-past seven when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) rang at the bell. At first fortune seemed to smile upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was announced he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was received with extraordinary rapidity.
<p/>As though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) were waiting for me,'' thought Mitya, and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had been led to the drawing-room, the lady of the house herself ran in, and declared at once that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>'' '' I was expecting you! I was expecting you! Though I'd no reason to suppose you would come to see me, as you will admit yourself.
<p/>Yet, I did expect you. You may marvel at my instinct, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but I was convinced all the morning that you would come.''
<p/>That is certainly wonderful, madam,'' observed Mitya, sitting down limply, <div class="bookquote">``but I have come to you on a matter of great importance...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know you've come on most important business, Dmitri Fyodorovitch; it's not a case of presentiment, no reactionary harking back to the miraculous -LRB-have you heard about Father Zossima?-RRB-.

 (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div><p/>'' On a matter of supreme importance for me, that is, madam ... for me alone ... and I hasten-- ''
<p/>The realism of actual life, madam, that's what it is. But allow me to explain-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Realism indeed, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I'm all for realism now.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya was a little surprised. The image of Alyosha rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mind. '' Excuse me for the triviality of the expression, but I'm in a fever--
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I know, I know that you're in a fever. You could hardly fail to be, and whatever you may say to me, I know beforehand.
<p/>I have long been thinking over your destiny, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I am watching over it and studying it.... Oh, believe me, I'm an experienced doctor of the soul, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Madam, if you are an experienced doctor, I'm certainly an experienced patient,'' said Mitya, with an effort to be polite, <div class="bookquote">``and I feel that if you are watching over my destiny in this way, you will come to my help in my ruin, and so allow me, at least to explain to you the plan with which I have ventured to come to you ... and what I am hoping of you

<p/>You have most likely heard of my cousin, Madame Belmesov. Her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) husband was ruined, `had come to grief,' as you characteristically express it, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.
<p/>I recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) to take to horse-breeding, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'s doing well.

(<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>cried Mitya, in nervous impatience, positively starting from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seat.
<p/>Only give me two minutes of free speech that I may just explain to you everything, the whole plan with which I have come.
<p/>I'm in a fearful hurry,'' Mitya cried hysterically, feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) was just going to begin talking again, and hoping to cut her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) short.
<p/>I have come in despair ... in the last gasp of despair, to beg you to lend me the sum of three thousand, a loan, but on safe, most safe security, madam, with the most trustworthy guarantees!
<p/>'' I simply implore you, madam, to listen to me. Besides, I am short of time. '' Only let me explain--'' <div class="bookquote">``You must tell me all that afterwards, afterwards!''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Madame Hohlakov with a gesture demanded silence in her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) turn, <div class="bookquote">``and whatever you may tell me, I know it all beforehand; I've told you so already.
<p/>You ask for a certain sum, for three thousand, but I can give you more, immeasurably more, I will save you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but you must listen to me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Hohlakov</b></font>)</div>Mitya started from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seat again. '' Madam, will you really be so good! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cried, with strong feeling.
<p/>'' Good God, you've saved me! You have saved a man from a violent death, from a bullet.... My eternal gratitude--
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I will give you more, infinitely more than three thousand!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Hohlakov</b></font>)</div>cried Madame Hohlakov, looking with a radiant smile at Mitya's ecstasy.
<p/>I only need that fatal three thousand, and on my part I can give security for that sum with infinite gratitude, and I propose a plan which--
<p/>Madame Hohlakov cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) short, with the modest triumph of beneficence: <div class="bookquote">``I have promised to save you, and I will save you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Infinitely? But I don't need so much. '' <div class="bookquote">``Enough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, it's said and done. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I will save you as I did Belmesov.
<p/>What do you think of the gold-mines, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?'' <div class="bookquote">``Of the gold-mines, madam? I have never thought anything about them.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>But I have thought of them for you. Thought of them over and over again. I have been watching you for the last month.
<p/>I've watched you a hundred times as you've walked past, saying to myself: That's a man of energy who ought to be at the gold-mines.
<p/>I've studied your gait and come to the conclusion: that's a man who would find gold.'' <div class="bookquote">``From my gait, madam? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>said Mitya, smiling.
<p/>'' Yes, from your gait. You surely don't deny that character can be told from the gait, Dmitri Fyodorovitch? Science supports the idea.
<p/>I'm all for science and realism now. After all this business with Father Zossima, which has so upset me, from this very day I'm a realist
<p/>and I want to devote myself to practical usefulness. I'm cured. ' Enough!' as Turgenev says. '' '' But, madam, the three thousand you so generously promised to lend me--''
<p/>The money is as good as in your pocket, not three thousand, but three million, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, in less than no time.
<p/>I'll make you a present of the idea: you shall find gold-mines, make millions, return and become a leading man, and wake us up and lead us to better things.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is yours, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Hohlakov</b></font>)</div>Madame Hohlakov cut in at once. '' Are we to leave it all to the Jews?
<p/>You will found institutions and enterprises of all sorts. You will help the poor, and they will bless you. This is the age of railways, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.
<p/>The depreciation of the rouble keeps me awake at night, Dmitri Fyodorovitch; people don't know that side of me--'' <div class="bookquote">``Madam, madam!''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>You'll become famous and indispensable to the Department of Finance, which is so badly off at present. Dmitri interrupted with an uneasy presentiment.
<p/>'' I shall indeed, perhaps, follow your advice, your wise advice, madam.... I shall perhaps set off ... to the gold-mines....
<p/>I'll come and see you again about it ... many times, indeed ... but now, that three thousand you so generously ...
<p/>oh, that would set me free, and if you could to-day ... you see, I haven't a minute, a minute to lose to-day--
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Enough, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, enough! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Madame Hohlakov interrupted emphatically. '' The question is, will you go to the gold-mines or not; have you quite made up your mind?
<p/>Answer yes or no.'' <div class="bookquote">``I will go, madam, afterwards.... I'll go where you like ... but now-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Hohlakov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wait! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Hohlakov</b></font>)</div>cried Madame Hohlakov.
<p/>And jumping up and running to a handsome bureau with numerous little drawers, she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) began pulling out one drawer after another, looking for something with desperate haste.
<p/>The three thousand,'' thought Mitya, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heart almost stopping, <div class="bookquote">``and at the instant ... without any papers or formalities ... that's doing things in gentlemanly style!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)'s a splendid woman, if only she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) didn't talk so much!'' <div class="bookquote">``Here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Hohlakov</b></font>)</div>cried Madame Hohlakov, running back joyfully to Mitya, <div class="bookquote">``here is what I was looking for!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>It was a tiny silver ikon on a cord, such as is sometimes worn next the skin with a cross.
<p/>Let me put it on your neck myself, and with it dedicate you to a new life, to a new career.
<p/>'' This is from Kiev, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) went on reverently, <div class="bookquote">``from the relics of the Holy Martyr, Varvara. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) actually put the cord round his (<font color='blue'><b>Martyr</b></font>) neck, and began arranging it.
<p/>In extreme embarrassment, Mitya bent down and helped her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>), and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) got it under his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) neck-tie and collar through his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shirt to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) chest.
<p/>'' Now you can set off,'' Madame Hohlakov pronounced, sitting down triumphantly in her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) place again. '' Madam, I am so touched.
<p/>I don't know how to thank you, indeed ... for such kindness, but ... If only you knew how precious time is to me....
<p/>Oh, madam, since you are so kind, so touchingly generous to me,'' Mitya exclaimed impulsively, <div class="bookquote">``then let me reveal to you ... though, of course, you've known it a long time ...
<p/>That sum of money, for which I shall be indebted to your generosity.... that I love somebody here.... I have been false to Katya ...
<p/>Oh, I've behaved inhumanly, dishonorably to her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>), but I fell in love here with another woman ... a woman whom you, madam, perhaps, despise, for you know everything already, but whom I cannot leave on any account, and therefore that three thousand now--
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna I should say... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Leave everything, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Hohlakov</b></font>)</div>Madame Hohlakov interrupted in the most decisive tone. '' Leave everything, especially women.
<p/>Gold-mines are your goal, and there's no place for women there. Afterwards, when you come back rich and famous, you will find the girl of your heart in the highest society.
<p/>That will be a modern girl, a girl of education and advanced ideas. By that time the dawning woman question will have gained ground, and the new woman will have appeared.''
<p/>Yes, it is, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, just what you need; the very thing you're yearning for, though you don't realize it yourself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Madam, that's not the point, not at all... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands in entreaty. '' I am not at all opposed to the present woman movement, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.
<p/>The development of woman, and even the political emancipation of woman in the near future--that's my ideal. I've a daughter myself, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, people don't know that side of me.
<p/>I wrote a letter to the author, Shtchedrin, on that subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) has taught me so much, so much about the vocation of woman.
<p/>So last year I sent him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) an anonymous letter of two lines: 'I kiss and embrace you, my teacher, for the modern woman.
<p/>Persevere.' And I signed myself, 'A Mother.' I thought of signing myself 'A contemporary Mother,' and hesitated, but I stuck to the simple `Mother'
<p/>; there's more moral beauty in that, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. And the word `contemporary' might have reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) of ' The Contemporary '--a painful recollection owing to the censorship....
<p/>Good Heavens, what is the matter!'' <div class="bookquote">``Madam!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>cried Mitya, jumping up at last, clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands before her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) in helpless entreaty.
<p/>'' You will make me weep if you delay what you have so generously-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, do weep, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, do weep!
<p/>That's a noble feeling ... such a path lies open before you! Tears will ease your heart, and later on you will return rejoicing.
<p/>You will hasten to me from Siberia on purpose to share your joy with me-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But allow me, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya cried suddenly.
<p/>'' For the last time I entreat you, tell me, can I have the sum you promised me to-day, if not, when may I come for it?''
<p/>'' What sum, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?'' <div class="bookquote">``The three thousand you promised me ... that you so generously-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Three thousand? Roubles? Oh, no, I haven't got three thousand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Hohlakov</b></font>)</div>Madame Hohlakov announced with serene amazement.
<p/>Mitya was stupefied. '' Why, you said just now ... you said ... you said it was as good as in my hands--
<p/>'' '' Oh, no, you misunderstood me, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. In that case you misunderstood me. I was talking of the gold-mines.
<p/>I promised you more, infinitely more than three thousand, I remember it all now, but I was referring to the gold-mines.''
<p/>It's true '' But the money? The three thousand?'' Mitya exclaimed, awkwardly. '' Oh, if you meant money, I haven't any.
<p/>I haven't a penny, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. I'm quarreling with my steward about it, and I've just borrowed five hundred roubles from Miüsov, myself.
<p/>No, no, I've no money. And, do you know, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, if I had, I wouldn't give it to you. In the first place I never lend money.
<p/>I wouldn't give it you, because I like you and want to save you, for all you need is the gold-mines, the gold-mines, the gold-mines!''
<p/>Lending money means losing friends. And I wouldn't give it to you particularly. '' Oh, the devil! '' roared Mitya, and with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) might brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) fist down on the table.
<p/>Mitya spat on the ground, and strode rapidly out of the room, out of the house, into the street, into the darkness!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) walked like one possessed, and beating himself on the breast, on the spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had struck himself two days previously, before Alyosha, the last time he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) in the dark, on the road.
<p/>What those blows upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) breast signified, on that spot , and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) meant by it--that was, for the time, a secret which was known to no one in the world, and had not been told even to Alyosha.
<p/>'' Aie! Aie! '' cried Madame Hohlakov, alarmed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) flew to the other end of the drawing-room. But that secret meant for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) more than disgrace; it meant ruin, suicide.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had determined, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) did not get hold of the three thousand that would pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) debt to Katerina Ivanovna, and so remove from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) breast, from that spot on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) breast , the shame he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) carried upon it, that weighed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) conscience.
<p/>All this will be fully explained to the reader later on, but now that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) last hope had vanished, this man, so strong in appearance, burst out crying like a little child a few steps from the Hohlakovs' house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) walked on, and not knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was doing, wiped away his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) tears with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) fist. In this way he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) reached the square, and suddenly became aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had stumbled against something.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heard a piercing wail from an old woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had almost knocked down. '' Good Lord, you've nearly killed me!
<p/>Why don't you look where you're going, scapegrace?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, it's you! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>cried Mitya, recognizing the old woman in the dark.
<p/>It was the old servant who waited on Samsonov, whom Mitya had particularly noticed the day before. '' And who are you, my good sir?
<p/>'' said the old woman, in quite a different voice. '' I don't know you in the dark.'' <div class="bookquote">``You live at Kuzma Kuzmitch's.
<p/>You're the servant there?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just so, sir, I was only running out to Prohoritch's.... But I don't know you now. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, my good woman, is Agrafena Alexandrovna there now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>said Mitya, beside himself with suspense. '' I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to the house some time ago.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has been there, sir. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stayed a little while, and went off again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What? Went away? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>cried Mitya.
<p/>'' When did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) go?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only stayed a minute. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only told Kuzma Kuzmitch a tale that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzmitch</b></font>) laugh, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ran away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You're lying, damn you! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>roared Mitya. '' Aie! Aie! '' shrieked the old woman, but Mitya had vanished. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) ran with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) might to the house where Grushenka lived.
<p/>At the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) reached it, Grushenka was on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way to Mokroe. It was not more than a quarter of an hour after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) departure.
<p/>Fenya was sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grandmother, the old cook, Matryona, in the kitchen when <div class="bookquote">``the captain''  (<font color='red'><b>Matryona</b></font>)</div>ran in. Fenya uttered a piercing shriek on seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>).
<p/>'' You scream?'' roared Mitya, <div class="bookquote">``where is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>But without giving the terror-stricken Fenya time to utter a word, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) fell all of a heap at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet.
<p/>'' Fenya, for Christ's sake, tell me, where is she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't know. Dmitri Fyodorovitch, my dear , I don't know.
<p/>You may kill me but I can't tell you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Fenya</b></font>)</div>Fenya swore and protested. '' You went out with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) yourself not long ago--
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came back!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) didn't. By God I swear she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) didn't come back. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' You're lying!'' shouted Mitya.
<p/>'' From your terror I know where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) rushed away. Fenya in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fright was glad she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had got off so easily.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew very well that it was only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was in such haste, or she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might not have fared so well.
<p/>On the table stood a brass mortar, with a pestle in it, a small brass pestle, not much more than six inches long.
<p/>Mitya already had opened the door with one hand when, with the other, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) snatched up the pestle, and thrust it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) side-pocket.
<p/>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) ran, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) surprised both Fenya and old Matryona by an unexpected action. '' Oh, Lord! He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s going to murder some one!
<p/>'' cried Fenya, flinging up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands. Chapter IV. In The Dark Where was he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) running? '' Where could she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) be except at Fyodor Pavlovitch's?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must have run straight to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) from Samsonov's, that was clear now. The whole intrigue, the whole deceit was evident.
<p/>'' ... It all rushed whirling through his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) did not run to Marya Kondratyevna's. '' There was no need to go there ... not the slightest need ...
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) must raise no alarm ... they would run and tell directly.... Marya Kondratyevna was clearly in the plot, Smerdyakov too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) too, all had been bought over!''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) formed another plan of action: he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) ran a long way round Fyodor Pavlovitch's house, crossing the lane, running down Dmitrovsky Street, then over the little bridge, and so came straight to the deserted alley at the back, which was empty and uninhabited, with, on one side the hurdle fence of a neighbor's kitchen-garden, on the other the strong high fence
<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) chose a spot, apparently the very place, where according to the tradition, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) knew Lizaveta had once climbed over it: <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could climb over it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lizaveta</b></font>)</div>the thought, God knows why, occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``surely I can.
<p/>, that ran all round Fyodor Pavlovitch's garden. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) did in fact jump up, and instantly contrived to catch hold of the top of the fence.
<p/>Close by, in the garden stood the bath-house, but from the fence he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) could see the lighted windows of the house too.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) vigorously pulled himself up and sat astride on it. '' Yes, the old man's bedroom is lighted up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>)'s there!''
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew Grigory was ill and very likely Smerdyakov, too, and that there was no one to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) instinctively hid himself, stood still, and began to listen.
<p/>But there was dead silence on all sides and, as though of design, complete stillness, not the slightest breath of wind.
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leapt from the fence into the garden. '' And naught but the whispering silence,'' the line for some reason rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind.
<p/>'' If only no one heard me jump over the fence! I think not. '' Standing still for a minute, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked softly over the grass in the garden, avoiding the trees and shrubs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked slowly, creeping stealthily at every step, listening to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own footsteps. It took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) five minutes to reach the lighted window.
<p/>The door from the house into the garden on the left-hand side, was shut; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had carefully looked on purpose to see, in passing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered that just under the window there were several thick and high bushes of elder and whitebeam. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached the bushes and hid behind them.
<p/>I must wait now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``to reassure them, in case they heard my footsteps and are listening ... if only I don't cough or sneeze.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breath. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waited two minutes. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart was beating violently, and, at moments, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could scarcely breathe.
<p/>'' No, this throbbing at my heart won't stop,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought. '' I can't wait any longer. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was standing behind a bush in the shadow.
<p/>The light of the window fell on the front part of the bush. '' How red the whitebeam berries are! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) murmured, not knowing why.
<p/>Softly and noiselessly, step by step, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) approached the window, and raised himself on tiptoe. All Fyodor Pavlovitch's bedroom lay open before him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>).
<p/>It was not a large room, and was divided in two parts by a red screen, <div class="bookquote">``Chinese,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div>as Fyodor Pavlovitch used to call it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) began watching Fyodor Pavlovitch, who was wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) new striped-silk dressing-gown, which Mitya had never seen, and a silk cord with tassels round the waist.
<p/>The word <div class="bookquote">``Chinese''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>flashed into Mitya's mind, <div class="bookquote">``and behind the screen, is Grushenka,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>thought Mitya. A clean, dandified shirt of fine linen with gold studs peeped out under the collar of the dressing-gown.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head Fyodor Pavlovitch had the same red bandage which Alyosha had seen. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) has got himself up,'' thought Mitya.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) jerked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head, listened a moment, and hearing nothing went up to the table, poured out half a glass of brandy from a decanter and drank it off.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) uttered a deep sigh, again stood still a moment, walked carelessly up to the looking-glass on the wall, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) right hand raised the red bandage on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) forehead a little, and began examining his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) bruises and scars, which had not yet disappeared.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father was standing near the window, apparently lost in thought. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s alone,'' thought Mitya, <div class="bookquote">``in all probability he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s alone.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Fyodor Pavlovitch moved away from the looking-glass, turned suddenly to the window and looked out. Mitya instantly slipped away into the shadow.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) may be there behind the screen. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s asleep by now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) thought, with a pang at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heart.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch moved away from the window. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>)'s looking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) out of the window, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s not there. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) stare out into the dark?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>)'s wild with impatience.'' ... Mitya slipped back at once, and fell to gazing in at the window again. The old man was sitting down at the table, apparently disappointed.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elbow on the table, and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right cheek against his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. Mitya watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) eagerly.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s alone! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) repeated again. '' If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) were here, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face would be different. '' Strange to say, a queer, irrational vexation rose up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heart that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was not here.
<p/>It's not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s not here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) explained to himself, immediately, <div class="bookquote">``but that I can't tell for certain whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is or not.
<p/>Mitya remembered afterwards that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mind was at that moment exceptionally clear, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) took in everything to the slightest detail, and missed no point.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' But a feeling of misery, the misery of uncertainty and indecision, was growing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heart with every instant.
<p/>The angry doubt filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heart, and suddenly, making up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hand and softly knocked on the window frame.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) knocked the signal the old man had agreed upon with Smerdyakov, twice slowly and then three times more quickly, the signal that meant <div class="bookquote">``Grushenka is here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Is she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) here or not? '' The old man started, jerked up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, and, jumping up quickly, ran to the window.
<p/>Mitya slipped away into the shadow. Fyodor Pavlovitch opened the window and thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) whole head out. '' Grushenka, is it you?
<p/>Is it you? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) said, in a sort of trembling half- whisper. '' Where are you, my angel, where are you?
<p/>'' cried the old man again; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head out farther, thrust it out to the shoulders, gazing in all directions, right and left.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was fearfully agitated and breathless. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s alone. '' Mitya decided. '' Where are you? '' Come here, I've a little present for you.
<p/>Come, I'll show you...'' <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) means the three thousand,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>thought Mitya. '' But where are you? Are you at the door?
<p/>And the old man almost climbed out of the window, peering out to the right, where there was a door into the garden, trying to see into the darkness.
<p/>I'll open it directly. '' In another second he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would certainly have run out to open the door without waiting for Grushenka's answer.
<p/>The old man's profile that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loathed so, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pendent Adam's apple, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hooked nose, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips that smiled in greedy expectation, were all brightly lighted up by the slanting lamplight falling on the left from the room.
<p/>A horrible fury of hatred suddenly surged up in Mitya's heart: ``There he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) rival, the man who had tormented him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), had ruined his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) life!
<p/>It was a rush of that sudden, furious, revengeful anger of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had spoken, as though foreseeing it, to Alyosha, four days ago in the arbor, when, in answer to Alyosha's question, <div class="bookquote">``How can you say you'll kill our father?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/>Mitya looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) from the side without stirring. '' '' I don't know, I don't know,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had said then.
<p/>'' Perhaps I shall not kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), perhaps I shall. I'm afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'ll suddenly be so loathsome to me at that moment.
<p/>I hate his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) double chin, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) nose, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shameless grin. I feel a personal repulsion. That's what I'm afraid of, that's what may be too much for me.'' ...
<p/>This personal repulsion was growing unendurable. Mitya was beside himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) suddenly pulled the brass pestle out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pocket. -------------------------------------
<p/>'' God was watching over me then,'' Mitya himself said afterwards. At that very moment Grigory waked up on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) bed of sickness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had rubbed himself all over with vodka mixed with a secret, very strong decoction, had drunk what was left of the mixture while his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wife repeated a <div class="bookquote">``certain prayer''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>over him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), after which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had gone to bed.
<p/>Earlier in the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had undergone the treatment which Smerdyakov had described to Ivan. Marfa Ignatyevna had tasted the stuff, too, and, being unused to strong drink, slept like the dead beside her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband.
<p/>But Grigory waked up in the night, quite suddenly, and, after a moment's reflection, though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) immediately felt a sharp pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) back, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sat up in bed.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) deliberated again, got up and dressed hurriedly. Perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) conscience was uneasy at the thought of sleeping while the house was unguarded <div class="bookquote">``in such perilous times.
<p/>The stuff's been too much for the woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grigory/Grigory Vassilyevitch</b></font>)</div>Grigory thought, glancing at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and groaning, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went out on the steps.
<p/>No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) only intended to look out from the steps, for he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was hardly able to walk, the pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) back and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) right leg was intolerable.
<p/>'' Smerdyakov, exhausted by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fit, lay motionless in the next room. Marfa Ignatyevna did not stir. '' But he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) suddenly remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had not locked the little gate into the garden that evening.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was the most punctual and precise of men, a man who adhered to an unchangeable routine, and habits that lasted for years.
<p/>Limping and writhing with pain he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went down the steps and towards the garden. Yes, the gate stood wide open. Mechanically he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stepped into the garden.
<p/>Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) fancied something, perhaps caught some sound, and, glancing to the left he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) master's window open. No one was looking out of it then.
<p/>It's not summer now,'' thought Grigory, and suddenly, at that very instant he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) caught a glimpse of something extraordinary before him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in the garden.
<p/>Forty paces in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) a man seemed to be running in the dark, a sort of shadow was moving very fast.
<p/>'' What's it open for? '' Good Lord!'' cried Grigory beside himself, and forgetting the pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) hurried to intercept the running figure.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) took a short cut, evidently he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) knew the garden better; the flying figure went towards the bath-house, ran behind it and rushed to the garden fence.
<p/>Grigory followed, not losing sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), and ran, forgetting everything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) reached the fence at the very moment the man was climbing over it.
<p/>Grigory cried out, beside himself, pounced on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and clutched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two hands. Yes, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) foreboding had not deceived him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>the old man shouted so that the whole neighborhood could hear, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not time to shout more, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell at once, as though struck by lightning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), it was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), the <div class="bookquote">``monster,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the <div class="bookquote">``parricide.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Parricide!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya jumped back into the garden and bent over the fallen man.
<p/>In Mitya's hands was a brass pestle, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) flung it mechanically in the grass. The pestle fell two paces from Grigory, not in the grass but on the path, in a most conspicuous place.
<p/>For some seconds he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) examined the prostrate figure before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). The old man's head was covered with blood. Mitya put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hand and began feeling it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) remembered afterwards clearly, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had been awfully anxious to make sure whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had broken the old man's skull, or simply stunned him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) with the pestle.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) remembered taking out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pocket the clean white handkerchief with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had provided himself for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) visit to Madame Hohlakov, and putting it to the old man's head, senselessly trying to wipe the blood from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face and temples.
<p/>But the blood was flowing horribly; and in a moment Mitya's fingers were drenched with the hot stream. But the handkerchief was instantly soaked with blood.
<p/>'' Good heavens! what am I doing it for? '' thought Mitya, suddenly pulling himself together. '' If I have broken his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) skull, how can I find out now?
<p/>And what difference does it make now? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) added, hopelessly. '' If I've killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), I've killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).... You've come to grief, old man, so there you must lie!
<p/>And suddenly turning to the fence, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vaulted over it into the lane and fell to running--the handkerchief soaked with blood he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held, crushed up in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right fist, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thrust it into the back pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran headlong, and the few passers-by who met him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the dark, in the streets, remembered afterwards that they had met a man running that night.
<p/>Immediately after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had left it that evening, Fenya had rushed to the chief porter, Nazar Ivanovitch, and besought him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>), for Christ's sake, ``not to let the captain in again to-day or to-morrow.
<p/>Nazar Ivanovitch promised, but went upstairs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) mistress who had suddenly sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>), and meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) nephew, a boy of twenty, who had recently come from the country, on the way up told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) place, but forgot to mention <div class="bookquote">``the captain.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) said aloud. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovitch</b></font>) flew back again to the widow Morozov's house. '' '' Mitya, running up to the gate, knocked.
<p/>Opening the gate at once, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) in, and hastened to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) with a good-humored smile that <div class="bookquote">``Agrafena Alexandrovna is not at home now, you know.
<p/>The lad instantly recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), for Mitya had more than once tipped him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) then, Prohor? '' asked Mitya, stopping short.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) set off this evening, some two hours ago, with Timofey, to Mokroe.'' <div class="bookquote">``What for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>cried Mitya. '' That I can't say.
<p/>To see some officer. Some one invited her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) and horses were sent to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>). '' Mitya left him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), and ran like a madman to Fenya.
<p/>Chapter V. A Sudden Resolution She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was sitting in the kitchen with her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) grandmother; they were both just going to bed.
<p/>Relying on Nazar Ivanovitch, they had not locked themselves in. Mitya ran in, pounced on Fenya and seized her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) by the throat.
<p/>'' Speak at once! Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)? With whom is she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) now, at Mokroe? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) roared furiously. Both the women squealed.
<p/>Dmitri Fyodorovitch, darling, I'll tell you everything directly, I won't hide anything,'' gabbled Fenya, frightened to death; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)'s gone to Mokroe, to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) officer.

<p/>'' Aie! I'll tell you. Aie! '' <div class="bookquote">``What officer?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>roared Mitya. '' Mitya withdrew the hands with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was squeezing her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) throat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) stood facing her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>), pale as death, unable to utter a word, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) eyes showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) realized it all, all, from the first word, and guessed the whole position.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) remained sitting on the trunk as she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had been when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) ran into the room, trembling all over, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) hands out before her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) as though trying to defend herself.
<p/>Poor Fenya was not in a condition at that moment to observe whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) understood or not. She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) seemed to have grown rigid in that position.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) wide-opened, scared eyes were fixed immovably upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). And to make matters worse, both his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands were smeared with blood.
<p/>On the way, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) ran, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) must have touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) forehead with them, wiping off the perspiration, so that on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) forehead and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) right cheek were blood-stained patches.
<p/>Fenya was on the verge of hysterics. The old cook had jumped up and was staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) like a mad woman, almost unconscious with terror.
<p/>Mitya stood for a moment, then mechanically sank on to a chair next to Fenya. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sat, not reflecting but, as it were, terror-stricken, benumbed.
<p/>Yet everything was clear as day: that officer, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) knew about him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) knew everything perfectly, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had known it from Grushenka herself, had known that a letter had come from him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) a month before.
<p/>So that for a month, for a whole month, this had been going on, a secret from him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), till the very arrival of this new man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!
<p/>But how could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), how could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not have thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Why was it he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had forgotten this officer, like that, forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?
<p/>That was the question that faced him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) like some monstrous thing. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at this monstrous thing with horror, growing cold with horror.
<p/>But suddenly, as gently and mildly as a gentle and affectionate child, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began speaking to Fenya as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had utterly forgotten how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had scared and hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) just now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell to questioning Fenya with an extreme preciseness, astonishing in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position, and though the girl looked wildly at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blood-stained hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), too, with wonderful readiness and rapidity, answered every question as though eager to put the whole truth and nothing but the truth before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Little by little, even with a sort of enjoyment, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) began explaining every detail, not wanting to torment him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but, as it were, eager to be of the utmost service to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) described the whole of that day, in great detail, the visit of Rakitin and Alyosha, how she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), Fenya, had stood on the watch, how the mistress had set off, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had called out of the window to Alyosha to give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Mitya, her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) greetings, and to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``to remember for ever how she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) for an hour.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Hearing of the message, Mitya suddenly smiled, and there was a flush of color on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pale cheeks. At the same moment Fenya said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), not a bit afraid now to be inquisitive:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at your hands, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. They're all over blood!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>answered Mitya mechanically. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) looked carelessly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands and at once forgot them and Fenya's question.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sank into silence again. Twenty minutes had passed since he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had run in. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) first horror was over, but evidently some new fixed determination had taken possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) suddenly stood up, smiling dreamily. '' What has happened to you, sir?'' said Fenya, pointing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) spoke compassionately, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) felt very near to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) now in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) grief.
<p/>Mitya looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands again. '' That's blood, Fenya,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) with a strange expression. '' That's human blood, and my God!
<p/>why was it shed? But ... Fenya ... there's a fence here '' -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) as though setting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) a riddle-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``a high fence, and terrible to look at.
<p/>But at dawn to-morrow, when the sun rises, Mitya will leap over that fence.... You don't understand what fence, Fenya, and, never mind....
<p/>You'll hear to-morrow and understand ... and now, good-by. I won't stand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) way. I'll step aside, I know how to step aside.
<p/>Live, my joy.... You loved me for an hour, remember Mityenka Karamazov so for ever.... She (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) always used to call me Mityenka, do you remember?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And with those words he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went suddenly out of the kitchen. Fenya was almost more frightened at this sudden departure than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had been when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) ran in and attacked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>Just ten minutes later Dmitri went in to Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, the young official with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had pawned his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) pistols.
<p/>It was by now half-past eight, and Pyotr Ilyitch had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) evening tea, and had just put his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) coat on again to go to the <div class="bookquote">``Metropolis''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Ilyitch/Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin/Perhotin</b></font>)</div>to play billiards.
<p/>Mitya caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) coming out. Seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face all smeared with blood, the young man uttered a cry of surprise.
<p/>'' Good heavens! What is the matter?'' <div class="bookquote">``I've come for my pistols,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>said Mitya, <div class="bookquote">``and brought you the money. And thanks very much.
<p/>Pyotr Ilyitch grew more and more surprised; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) suddenly caught sight of a bundle of bank-notes in Mitya's hand, and what was more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had walked in holding the notes as no one walks in and no one carries money: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) right hand, and held them outstretched as if to show them.
<p/>Perhotin's servant-boy, who met Mitya in the passage, said afterwards that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) walked into the passage in the same way, with the money outstretched in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hand, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) must have been carrying them like that even in the streets.
<p/>I'm in a hurry, Pyotr Ilyitch, please make haste. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>They were all rainbow-colored hundred-rouble notes, and the fingers holding them were covered with blood.
<p/>When Pyotr Ilyitch was questioned later on as to the sum of money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said that it was difficult to judge at a glance, but that it might have been two thousand, or perhaps three, but it was a big, <div class="bookquote">``fat''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>bundle.
<p/>'' so he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) testified afterwards, <div class="bookquote">``seemed unlike himself, too; not drunk, but, as it were, exalted, lost to everything, but at the same time, as it were, absorbed, as though pondering and searching for something and unable to come to a decision.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was in great haste, answered abruptly and very strangely, and at moments seemed not at all dejected but quite cheerful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Dmitri Fyodorovitch, '' But what is the matter with you? What's wrong?'' cried Pyotr Ilyitch, looking wildly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) guest.
<p/>'' How is it that you're all covered with blood? Have you had a fall? Look at yourself!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) by the elbow and led him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) to the glass.
<p/>That's the last straw,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) muttered angrily, hurriedly changing the notes from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) right hand to the left, and impulsively jerked the handkerchief out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>But the handkerchief turned out to be soaked with blood, too -LRB-it was the handkerchief he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had used to wipe Grigory's face-RRB-.
<p/>There was scarcely a white spot on it, and it had not merely begun to dry, but had stiffened into a crumpled ball and could not be pulled apart.
<p/>Seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) blood-stained face, Mitya started and scowled wrathfully. <div class="bookquote">``Damnation! Mitya threw it angrily on the floor. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh, damn it!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said. '' Haven't you a rag of some sort ... to wipe my face?'' '' So you're only stained, not wounded?
<p/>You'd better wash,'' said Pyotr Ilyitch. '' Here's a wash-stand. I'll pour you out some water.'' <div class="bookquote">``A wash-stand? That's all right ...
<p/>With the strangest perplexity he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) indicated his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) bundle of hundred-rouble notes, looking inquiringly at Pyotr Ilyitch as though it were for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to decide what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), Mitya, was to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) own money.
<p/>but where am I to put this? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' In your pocket, or on the table here. They won't be lost.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In my pocket? Yes, in my pocket. All right.... But, I say, that's all nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cried, as though suddenly coming out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) absorption.
<p/>Here's your money ... because I am in great need of them ... and I haven't a minute, a minute to spare.
<p/>'' Look here, let's first settle that business of the pistols. Give them back to me. '' And taking the topmost note from the bundle he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) held it out to Pyotr Ilyitch.
<p/>No,'' said Mitya, looking again at the bundle, and as though not trusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) own words he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) turned over two or three of the topmost ones.
<p/>'' But I shan't have change enough. Haven't you less?'' '' '' No, they're all alike,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) added, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) looked inquiringly at Pyotr Ilyitch.
<p/>'' How have you grown so rich? '' the latter asked. '' Wait, I'll send my boy to Plotnikov's, they close late--to see if they won't change it.
<p/>Here, Misha! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) called into the passage. '' To Plotnikov's shop--first-rate!'' cried Mitya, as though struck by an idea. ''
<p/>Misha,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) turned to the boy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) came in, <div class="bookquote">``look here, run to Plotnikov's and tell them that Dmitri Fyodorovitch sends his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) greetings, and will be there directly....
<p/>But listen, listen, tell them to have champagne, three dozen bottles, ready before I come, and packed as it was to take to Mokroe.
<p/>I took four dozen with me then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) added -LRB-suddenly addressing Pyotr Ilyitch-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``they know all about it, don't you trouble, Misha,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Ilyitch/Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin/Perhotin</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) turned again to the boy.
<p/>Stay, listen; tell them to put in cheese, Strasburg pies, smoked fish, ham, caviare, and everything, everything they've got, up to a hundred roubles, or a hundred and twenty as before...
<p/>, one melon's enough, and chocolate, candy, toffee, fondants; in fact, everything I took to Mokroe before, three hundred roubles' worth with the champagne ... let it be just the same again.
<p/>'' But wait: don't let them forget dessert, sweets, pears, water-melons, two or three or four--no And remember, Misha, if you are called Misha--His (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) name is Misha, isn't it?''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) turned to Pyotr Ilyitch again. '' Wait a minute,'' Protr Ilyitch intervened, listening and watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) uneasily, <div class="bookquote">``you'd better go yourself and tell them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>)'ll muddle it.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) will, I see he (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) will! Eh, Misha! Why, I was going to kiss you for the commission....
<p/>If you don't make a mistake, there's ten roubles for you, run along, make haste.... Champagne's the chief thing, let them bring up champagne.
<p/>And brandy, too, and red and white wine, and all I had then.... They know what I had then.'' '' But listen!''
<p/>I say, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) simply run and change the money and tell them not to close, and you go and tell them....
<p/>Pyotr Ilyitch seemed to hurry Misha off on purpose, because the boy remained standing with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mouth and eyes wide open, apparently understanding little of Mitya's orders, gazing up with amazement and terror at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) blood-stained face and the trembling bloodstained fingers that held the notes.
<p/>Pyotr Ilyitch interrupted with some impatience. '' Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) your note. Be off, Misha! Put your best leg forward!'' '' Well, now come and wash,'' said Pyotr Ilyitch sternly.
<p/>'' Put the money on the table or else in your pocket.... That's right, come along. But take off your coat.
<p/>'' And beginning to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) off with his (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) coat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) cried out again: <div class="bookquote">``Look, your coat's covered with blood, too!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' That ... it's not the coat. It's only a little here on the sleeve.... And that's only here where the handkerchief lay.
<p/>I must have sat on the handkerchief at Fenya's, and the blood's come through,'' Mitya explained at once with a childlike unconsciousness that was astounding.
<p/>It must have soaked through. Pyotr Ilyitch listened, frowning. '' Well, you must have been up to something; you must have been fighting with some one,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) muttered.
<p/>They began to wash. Pyotr Ilyitch held the jug and poured out the water. Mitya, in desperate haste, scarcely soaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands -LRB-they were trembling, and Pyotr Ilyitch remembered it afterwards-RRB-.
<p/>But the young official insisted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) soaping them thoroughly and rubbing them more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seemed to exercise more and more sway over Mitya, as time went on.
<p/>It may be noted in passing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was a young man of sturdy character. '' Look, you haven't got your nails clean.
<p/>Now rub your face; here, on your temples, by your ear.... Will you go in that shirt? Where are you going?
<p/>Look, all the cuff of your right sleeve is covered with blood.'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's all bloody,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>observed Mitya, looking at the cuff of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shirt.
<p/>'' Mitya went on with the same confiding ingenuousness, drying his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face and hands on the towel, and putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) coat.
<p/>'' Then change your shirt.'' '' I haven't time. You see I'll ... '' I'll turn it up at the wrist.
<p/>It won't be seen under the coat.... You see!'' <div class="bookquote">``Tell me now, what game have you been up to? Have you been fighting with some one?
<p/>In the tavern again, as before? Have you been beating that captain again?''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Ilyitch/Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin/Perhotin</b></font>)</div>Pyotr Ilyitch asked him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) reproachfully. '' Whom have you been beating now ... or killing, perhaps?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>said Mitya. '' Why `nonsense'?'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't worry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>said Mitya, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) suddenly laughed. '' I smashed an old woman in the market-place just now.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``An old man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>cried Mitya, looking Pyotr Ilyitch straight in the face, laughing, and shouting at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) were deaf.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Smashed? An old woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Confound it! An old woman, an old man.... Have you killed some one?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' We made it up.

<p/>'' Whatever do you want to go picking quarrels with every one for? ... Just as you did with that captain over some nonsense....
<p/>You've been fighting and now you're rushing off on the spree --that's you all over! Three dozen champagne --what do you want all that for?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bravo! Now give me the pistols. Upon my honor I've no time now. I should like to have a chat with you, my dear boy, but I haven't the time.

<p/>Two or three I should say. '' <div class="bookquote">``Three, you bet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>laughed Mitya, stuffing the notes into the side-pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) trousers.
<p/>'' You'll lose it like that. Have you found a gold-mine? '' <div class="bookquote">``The mines? The gold-mines? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya shouted at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) voice and went off into a roar of laughter.

<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) took the bullet and, before inserting it, held it in two fingers in front of the candle. '' Why are you looking at the bullet?'' asked Pyotr Ilyitch, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) with uneasy curiosity.
<p/>'' Oh, a fancy. Why, if you meant to put that bullet in your brain, would you look at it or not?''

<p/>that's nonsense, all nonsense, and if only you knew what nonsense! Give me a little piece of paper now. '' ''
<p/>And taking a pen from the table, Mitya rapidly wrote two lines, folded the paper in four, and thrust it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) waistcoat pocket.
<p/>Here's some paper. '' <div class="bookquote">``No, a clean new piece, writing-paper. That's right.

<p/>'' There's a woman there, a woman. That's enough for you. You shut up.'' <div class="bookquote">``Listen, though you're such a savage I've always liked you....

<p/>It was the largest grocery shop in our town, and by no means a bad one, belonging to some rich merchants.
<p/>They kept everything that could be got in a Petersburg shop, grocery of all sort, wines <div class="bookquote">``bottled by the brothers Eliseyev,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>fruits, cigars, tea, coffee, sugar, and so on.
<p/>March! '' Plotnikov's shop was at the corner of the street, next door but one to Pyotr Ilyitch's. There were three shop-assistants and two errand boys always employed.
<p/>Though our part of the country had grown poorer, the landowners had gone away, and trade had got worse, yet the grocery stores flourished as before, every year with increasing prosperity; there were plenty of purchasers for their goods.
<p/>They had vivid recollections of how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ilyitch</b></font>) had bought, three or four weeks ago, wine and goods of all sorts to the value of several hundred roubles, paid for in cash -LRB-they would never have let him (<font color='blue'><b>Ilyitch</b></font>) have anything on credit, of course-RRB-.
<p/>They remembered that then, as now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ilyitch</b></font>) had had a bundle of hundred-rouble notes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ilyitch</b></font>) hand, and had scattered them at random, without bargaining, without reflecting, or caring to reflect what use so much wine and provisions would be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ilyitch</b></font>).
<p/>The story was told all over the town that, driving off then with Grushenka to Mokroe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ilyitch</b></font>) had ``spent three thousand in one night and the following day, and had come back from the spree without a penny.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ilyitch</b></font>) had picked up a whole troop of gypsies -LRB-encamped in our neighborhood at the time-RRB-, who for two days got money without stint out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ilyitch</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>Ilyitch</b></font>) was drunk, and drank expensive wine without stint.
<p/>People used to tell, laughing at Mitya, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had given champagne to grimy- handed peasants, and feasted the village women and girls on sweets and Strasburg pies.
<p/>Though to laugh at Mitya to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face was rather a risky proceeding, there was much laughter behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) back, especially in the tavern, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) own ingenuous public avowal that all he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had got out of Grushenka by this <div class="bookquote">``escapade''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was <div class="bookquote">``permission to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) foot, and that was the utmost
<p/>By the time Mitya and Pyotr Ilyitch reached the shop, they found a cart with three horses harnessed abreast with bells, and with Andrey, the driver, ready waiting for Mitya at the entrance.
<p/>In the shop they had almost entirely finished packing one box of provisions, and were only waiting for Mitya's arrival to nail it down and put it in the cart.
<p/>They were awaiting Mitya with impatience in the shop. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). '' Pyotr Ilyitch was astounded. '' Where did this cart come from in such a hurry?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) asked Mitya. '' I met Andrey as I ran to you, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to drive straight here to the shop.
<p/>There's no time to lose. Last time I drove with Timofey, but Timofey now has gone on before me with the witch.
<p/>Shall we be very late, Andrey?'' '' They'll only get there an hour at most before us, not even that maybe.
<p/>I got Timofey ready to start. I know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>)'ll go. Their pace won't be ours, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. How could it be?
<p/>They won't get there an hour earlier!'' Andrey, a lanky, red-haired, middle-aged driver, wearing a full- skirted coat, and with a kaftan on his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) arm, replied warmly.
<p/>'' Fifty roubles for vodka if we're only an hour behind them.'' <div class="bookquote">``I warrant the time, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. Ech, they won't be half an hour before us, let alone an hour.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Though Mitya bustled about seeing after things, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) orders strangely, as it were disconnectedly, and inconsecutively. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) began a sentence and forgot the end of it.
<p/>Pyotr Ilyitch found himself obliged to come to the rescue. '' Four hundred roubles' worth, not less than four hundred roubles' worth, just as it was then,'' commanded Mitya.
<p/>'' Four dozen champagne, not a bottle less.'' '' What do you want with so much? What's it for? Stay! '' cried Pyotr Ilyitch.
<p/>The officious shopmen began explaining with oily politeness that the first box contained only half a dozen bottles of champagne, and only <div class="bookquote">``the most indispensable articles,''  (<font color='red'><b>a dozen</b></font>)</div>such as savories, sweets, toffee, etc..
<p/>But the main part of the goods ordered would be packed and sent off, as on the previous occasion, in a special cart also with three horses traveling at full speed, so that it would arrive not more than an hour later than Dmitri Fyodorovitch himself.
<p/>'' What's this box? What's in it? Surely there isn't four hundred roubles' worth here? '' '' Not more than an hour!
<p/>Not more than an hour! And put in more toffee and fondants. The girls there are so fond of it,'' Mitya insisted hotly.
<p/>'' The fondants are all right. But what do you want with four dozen of champagne? One would be enough,'' said Pyotr Ilyitch, almost angry.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) began bargaining, asking for a bill of the goods, and refused to be satisfied. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) only succeeded in saving a hundred roubles.
<p/>In the end it was agreed that only three hundred roubles' worth should be sent. '' Well, you may go to the devil!
<p/>'' cried Pyotr Ilyitch, on second thoughts. '' What's it to do with me? Throw away your money, since it's cost you nothing.''
<p/>'' This way, my economist, this way, don't be angry. '' Mitya drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) into a room at the back of the shop.
<p/>'' They'll give us a bottle here directly. We'll taste it. Ech, Pyotr Ilyitch, come along with me, for you're a nice fellow, the sort I like.
<p/>'' Mitya sat down on a wicker chair, before a little table, covered with a dirty dinner-napkin. Pyotr Ilyitch sat down opposite, and the champagne soon appeared, and oysters were suggested to the gentlemen.
<p/>'' First-class oysters, the last lot in.'' <div class="bookquote">``Hang the oysters. I don't eat them. And we don't need anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Ilyitch/Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin/Perhotin</b></font>)</div>cried Pyotr Ilyitch, almost angrily.
<p/>'' There's no time for oysters,'' said Mitya. '' And I'm not hungry. Do you know, friend,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said suddenly, with feeling, <div class="bookquote">``I never have liked all this disorder.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who does like it? Three dozen of champagne for peasants, upon my word, that's enough to make any one angry!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>That's not what I mean. I'm talking of a higher order. There's no order in me, no higher order. But ... that's all over.
<p/>There's no need to grieve about it. It's too late, damn it! My whole life has been disorder, and one must set it in order.
<p/>Is that a pun, eh?'' '' You're raving, not making puns!'' '' Glory be to God in Heaven, Glory be to God in me...
<p/>'' That verse came from my heart once, it's not a verse, but a tear.... I made it myself ... not while I was pulling the captain's beard, though...''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why do you bring him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) in all of a sudden?''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why do I bring him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) in? Foolery!

<p/>Why am I pleased with myself? I'm a scoundrel, but I'm satisfied with myself. And yet I'm tortured by the thought that I'm a scoundrel, but satisfied with myself.
<p/>I'm ready to bless God and His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) creation directly, but ... I must kill one noxious insect for fear it should crawl and spoil life for others....
<p/>I bless the creation. Let us drink to life, dear brother. What can be more precious than life? Nothing! To life, and to one queen of queens!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's drink to life and to your queen, too, if you like. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They drank a glass each. Although Mitya was excited and expansive, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was melancholy, too.
<p/>It was as though some heavy, overwhelming anxiety were weighing upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). '' Misha ... here's your Misha come! Misha, come here, my boy, drink this glass to Phoebus, the golden-haired, of to-morrow morn...
<p/>'' '' What are you giving it him (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>) for?'' cried Pyotr Ilyitch, irritably. '' Yes, yes, yes, let me! I want to!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``E--ech!''  (<font color='red'><b>Misha</b></font>)</div>Misha emptied the glass, bowed, and ran out. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Misha</b></font>)'ll remember it afterwards,'' Mitya remarked. '' Woman, I love woman!
<p/>What is woman? The queen of creation! My heart is sad, my heart is sad, Pyotr Ilyitch. Do you remember Hamlet? '
<p/>I am very sorry, good Horatio! Alas, poor Yorick!' Perhaps that's me, Yorick? Yes, I'm Yorick now, and a skull afterwards.
<p/>'' Pyotr Ilyitch listened in silence. Mitya, too, was silent for a while. '' What dog's that you've got here? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) asked the shopman, casually, noticing a pretty little lap-dog with dark eyes, sitting in the corner.
<p/>'' It belongs to Varvara Alexyevna, the mistress,'' answered the clerk. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) brought it and forgot it here. It must be taken back to her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>).''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I saw one like it ... in the regiment ... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>murmured Mitya dreamily, <div class="bookquote">``only that one had its hind leg broken....
<p/>By the way, Pyotr Ilyitch, I wanted to ask you: have you ever stolen anything in your life?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What a question!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh, I didn't mean anything. From somebody's pocket, you know. I don't mean government money, every one steals that, and no doubt you do, too...
<p/>'' '' You go to the devil.'' '' I'm talking of other people's money. Stealing straight out of a pocket? Out of a purse, eh?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years old. I took it off the table on the sly, and held it tight in my hand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well, and what happened?'' '' Oh, nothing. I kept it three days, then I felt ashamed, confessed, and gave it back.''
<p/>'' And what then?'' '' Naturally I was whipped. But why do you ask? Have you stolen something?'' <div class="bookquote">``I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>said Mitya, winking slyly.
<p/>'' What have you stolen?'' inquired Pyotr Ilyitch curiously. '' I stole twenty copecks from my mother when I was nine years old, and gave it back three days after.
<p/>'' As he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said this, Mitya suddenly got up. '' Dmitri Fyodorovitch, won't you come now?'' called Andrey from the door of the shop.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you ready? We'll come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya started. '' A few more last words and-- Andrey, a glass of vodka at starting.
<p/>Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) some brandy as well! That box'' -LRB-the one with the pistols-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``put under my seat. Good-by, Pyotr Ilyitch, don't remember evil against me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But you're coming back to-morrow?'' <div class="bookquote">``Of course. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Will you settle the little bill now? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>cried the clerk, springing forward.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pulled the bundle of notes out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pocket again, picked out three hundred roubles, threw them on the counter, and ran hurriedly out of the shop.
<p/>'' Oh, yes, the bill. Of course. '' Every one followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) out, bowing and wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) good luck. Andrey, coughing from the brandy he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) had just swallowed, jumped up on the box.
<p/>But Mitya was only just taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seat when suddenly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) surprise he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) saw Fenya before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) ran up panting, clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) hands before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) with a cry, and plumped down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) feet.
<p/>'' Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear good Dmitri Fyodorovitch, don't harm my mistress. And it was I told you all about it.... And don't murder him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) came first, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'s hers!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'ll marry Agrafena Alexandrovna now. That's why he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'s come back from Siberia. Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear, don't take a fellow creature's life!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tut--tut--tut! That's it, is it? So you're off there to make trouble! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Ilyitch/Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin/Perhotin</b></font>)</div>muttered Pyotr Ilyitch. '' Now, it's all clear, as clear as daylight.
<p/>Dmitri Fyodorovitch, give me your pistols at once if you mean to behave like a man,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) shouted aloud to Mitya.
<p/>'' Do you hear, Dmitri?'' '' The pistols? Wait a bit, brother, I'll throw them into the pool on the road,'' answered Mitya.
<p/>'' Fenya, get up, don't kneel to me. Mitya won't hurt any one, the silly fool won't hurt any one again.
<p/>But I say, Fenya,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shouted, after having taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seat. '' I hurt you just now, so forgive me and have pity on me, forgive a scoundrel....
<p/>But it doesn't matter if you don't. It's all the same now. Now then, Andrey, look alive, fly along full speed!''
<p/>Andrey whipped up the horses, and the bells began ringing. '' Good-by, Pyotr Ilyitch! My last tear is for you!...'' ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) had half a mind to stay and see the cart packed with the remaining wines and provisions, knowing that they would deceive and defraud Mitya.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s not drunk, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) keeps babbling like a lunatic,'' Pyotr Ilyitch thought as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) go. But, suddenly feeling vexed with himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) turned away with a curse and went to the tavern to play billiards.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s a fool, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s a good fellow,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) muttered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went. '' I've heard of that officer, Grushenka's former flame.
<p/>Well, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) has turned up.... Ech, those pistols! Damn it all! I'm not his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) nurse! Let them do what they like!
<p/>Besides, it'll all come to nothing. They're a set of brawlers, that's all. They'll drink and fight, fight and make friends again.
<p/>They are not men who do anything real. What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mean by `I'm stepping aside, I'm punishing myself?' It'll come to nothing!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s shouted such phrases a thousand times, drunk, in the taverns. But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s not drunk. ' Drunk in spirit'--they're fond of fine phrases, the villains.
<p/>Am I his (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) nurse? He (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) must have been fighting, his (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) face was all over blood. With whom? I shall find out at the `Metropolis.'
<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) handkerchief was soaked in blood.... It's still lying on my floor.... Hang it!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) reached the tavern in a bad humor and at once made up a game.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) played a second game, and suddenly began telling one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Drunk</b></font>) partners that Dmitri Karamazov had come in for some cash again--something like three thousand roubles, and had gone to Mokroe again to spend it with Grushenka....
<p/>The game cheered him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>). This news roused singular interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) listeners. They all spoke of it, not laughing, but with a strange gravity.
<p/>They left off playing. '' Three thousand? But where can he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) have got three thousand? '' Questions were asked. The story of Madame Hohlakov's present was received with skepticism.
<p/>'' Hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) robbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) old father?--that's the question. '' <div class="bookquote">``Three thousand! There's something odd about it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) boasted aloud that he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) would kill his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) father; we all heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>), here.
<p/>And it was three thousand he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) talked about ...'' Pyotr Ilyitch listened. All at once he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) became short and dry in his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) answers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) said not a word about the blood on Mitya's face and hands, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had meant to speak of it at first.
<p/>But by the end of the third game, Pyotr Ilyitch felt no more desire for billiards; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) laid down the cue, and without having supper as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had intended, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) walked out of the tavern.
<p/>They began a third game, and by degrees the talk about Mitya died away. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) reached the market-place he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) stood still in perplexity, wondering at himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) realized that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wanted was to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch's and find out if anything had happened there. ''
<p/>On account of some stupid nonsense--as it's sure to turn out--am I going to wake up the household and make a scandal?
<p/>Fooh! damn it, is it my business to look after them?'' In a very bad humor he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) went straight home, and suddenly remembered Fenya.
<p/>'' Damn it all! I ought to have questioned her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) just now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) thought with vexation, <div class="bookquote">``I should have heard everything.
<p/>And the desire to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and so find out, became so pressing and importunate that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was half-way home he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) turned abruptly and went towards the house where Grushenka lodged.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Going up to the gate he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) knocked. The sound of the knock in the silence of the night sobered him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) feel annoyed.
<p/>And no one answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>); every one in the house was asleep. '' And I shall be making a fuss! ''
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) thought, with a feeling of positive discomfort. But instead of going away altogether, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) fell to knocking again with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) might, filling the street with clamor.
<p/>'' Not coming? Well, I will knock them up, I will! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) muttered at each knock, fuming at himself, but at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) redoubled his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) knocks on the gate.
<p/>It was a little more than twenty versts to Mokroe, but Andrey's three horses galloped at such a pace that the distance might be covered in an hour and a quarter.
<p/>Chapter VI. '' I Am Coming, Too!'' But Dmitri Fyodorovitch was speeding along the road. The swift motion revived Mitya. The air was fresh and cool, there were big stars shining in the sky.
<p/>It was the very night, and perhaps the very hour, in which Alyosha fell on the earth, and rapturously swore to love it for ever and ever.
<p/>All was confusion, confusion, in Mitya's soul, but although many things were goading his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heart, at that moment his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) whole being was yearning for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) queen, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was flying to look on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) for the last time.
<p/>I shall perhaps not be believed when I say that this jealous lover felt not the slightest jealousy of this new rival, who seemed to have sprung out of the earth.
<p/>If any other had appeared on the scene, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) would have been jealous at once, and would perhaps have stained his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) fierce hands with blood again.
<p/>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) flew through the night, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) felt no envy, no hostility even, for the man who had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) first lover....
<p/>One thing I can say for certain; his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) heart did not waver for one instant. It is true he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had not yet seen him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>).
<p/>Here there was no room for dispute: it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) right and his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>); this was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) first love which, after five years, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had not forgotten; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) only for those five years, and I, how do I come in?
<p/>'' What right have I? Step aside, Mitya, and make way! What am I now? Now everything is over apart from the officer--even if he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had not appeared, everything would be over ...
<p/>'' These words would roughly have expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) feelings, if he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had been capable of reasoning. But he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) could not reason at that moment.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) present plan of action had arisen without reasoning. At Fenya's first words, it had sprung from feeling, and been adopted in a flash, with all its consequences.
<p/>And yet, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) resolution, there was confusion in his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) soul, an agonizing confusion: his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) resolution did not give him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) peace.
<p/>And it seemed strange to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), at moments, to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had written his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) own sentence of death with pen and paper: <div class="bookquote">``I punish myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the paper was lying there in his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) pocket, ready; the pistol was loaded; he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had already resolved how, next morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) would meet the first warm ray of <div class="bookquote">``golden-haired Phoebus.
<p/>And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) could not be quit of the past, of all that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had left behind and that tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>).
<p/>There was so much behind that tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) felt that miserably, and the thought of it sank into his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) heart with despair.
<p/>There was one moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) felt an impulse to stop Andrey, to jump out of the cart, to pull out his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) loaded pistol, and to make an end of everything without waiting for the dawn.
<p/>The horses galloped on, <div class="bookquote">``devouring space,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) drew near his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) goal, again the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>), of her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) alone, took more and more complete possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) soul, chasing away the fearful images that had been haunting it.
<p/>But that moment flew by like a spark. Oh, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) longed to look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>), if only for a moment, if only from a distance!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>)'s now with him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) ,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``now I shall see what she (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) looks like with him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) first love, and that's all I want.
<p/>Never had this woman, who was such a fateful influence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) life, aroused such love in his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) breast, such new and unknown feeling, surprising even to himself, a feeling tender to devoutness, to self-effacement before her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>)!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' I will efface myself!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) said, in a rush of almost hysterical ecstasy. They had been galloping nearly an hour.
<p/>Mitya was silent, and though Andrey was, as a rule, a talkative peasant, he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) did not utter a word, either. He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) seemed afraid to talk, he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) only whipped up smartly his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) three lean, but mettlesome, bay horses.
<p/>Suddenly Mitya cried out in horrible anxiety: <div class="bookquote">``Andrey! What if they're asleep? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>This thought fell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) like a blow.
<p/>It had not occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) before. '' It may well be that they're gone to bed, by now, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.''
<p/>Mitya frowned as though in pain. Yes, indeed ... he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was rushing there ... with such feelings ... while they were asleep ...
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was asleep, perhaps, there too.... An angry feeling surged up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heart. '' Drive on, Andrey! Whip them up!
<p/>Look alive! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) cried, beside himself. '' But maybe they're not in bed!'' Andrey went on after a pause. ''
<p/>Timofey said they were a lot of them there-- '' <div class="bookquote">``At the station?''  (<font color='red'><b>Timofey</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at the posting-station, but at Plastunov's, at the inn, where they let out horses, too.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know. So you say there are a lot of them? How's that? Who are they? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>cried Mitya, greatly dismayed at this unexpected news.
<p/>'' Well, Timofey was saying they're all gentlefolk. Two from our town--who they are I can't say--and there are two others, strangers, maybe more besides.
<p/>I didn't ask particularly. They've set to playing cards, so Timofey said.'' <div class="bookquote">``Cards?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' So, maybe they're not in bed if they're at cards.
<p/>It's most likely not more than eleven.'' <div class="bookquote">``Quicker, Andrey! Quicker! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya cried again, nervously. '' May I ask you something, sir?'' said Andrey, after a pause.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Fenya threw herself at your feet just now, and begged you not to harm her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mistress, and some one else, too ...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Only I'm afraid of angering you, sir. '' '' What is it?'' so you see, sir-- It's I am taking you there ...
<p/>forgive me, sir, it's my conscience ... maybe it's stupid of me to speak of it-- '' Mitya suddenly seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) by the shoulders from behind.
<p/>'' Are you a driver? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) asked frantically. '' Yes, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Then you know that one has to make way.
<p/>What would you say to a driver who wouldn't make way for any one, but would just drive on and crush people?
<p/>No, a driver mustn't run over people. One can't run over a man. One can't spoil people's lives. And if you have spoilt a life--punish yourself....
<p/>If only you've spoilt, if only you've ruined any one's life--punish yourself and go away. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>These phrases burst from Mitya almost hysterically.
<p/>That's right, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, you're quite right, one mustn't crush or torment a man, or any kind of creature, for every creature is created by God.
<p/>Though Andrey was surprised at him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) kept up the conversation. '' Take a horse, for instance, for some folks, even among us drivers, drive anyhow.
<p/>Nothing will restrain them, they just force it along.'' <div class="bookquote">``To hell? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya interrupted, and went off into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) abrupt, short laugh.
<p/>Andrey, simple soul,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) by the shoulders again, <div class="bookquote">``tell me, will Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov go to hell, or not, what do you think?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>you see, sir, when the Son of God was nailed on the Cross and died, He (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) went straight down to hell from the Cross, and set free all sinners that were in agony.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't know, darling, it depends on you, for you are ... And the devil groaned, because he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) would get no more sinners in hell.
<p/>And God said to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), then, `Don't groan, for you shall have all the mighty of the earth, the rulers, the chief judges, and the rich men, and shall be filled up as you have been in all the ages till I come again.'
<p/>So you see, sir, who it is hell's for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Andrey</b></font>)</div>said Andrey, whipping up the left horse, <div class="bookquote">``but you're like a little child ...
<p/>Those were His (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) very words ... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Andrey</b></font>)</div>'' A peasant legend! Capital! Whip up the left, Andrey!'' '' that's how we look on you ...
<p/>and though you're hasty-tempered, sir, yet God will forgive you for your kind heart.'' '' And you, do you forgive me, Andrey?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What should I forgive you for, sir? You've never done me any harm.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' No, for every one, for every one, you here alone, on the road, will you forgive me for every one?
<p/>Speak, simple peasant heart!'' '' Oh, sir! I feel afraid of driving you, your talk is so strange. '' But Mitya did not hear.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was frantically praying and muttering to himself. '' Lord, receive me, with all my lawlessness, and do not condemn me.
<p/>Let me pass by Thy judgment ... do not condemn me, for I have condemned myself, do not condemn me, for I love Thee, O Lord.
<p/>If Thou sendest me to hell, I shall love Thee there, and from there I shall cry out that I love Thee for ever and ever....
<p/>Here and now for just five hours ... till the first light of Thy day ... for I love the queen of my soul ...
<p/>I am a wretch, but I love Thee. But let me love to the end.... I love her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) and I cannot help loving her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>).
<p/>Thou seest my whole heart.... I shall gallop up, I shall fall before her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) and say, `You are right to pass on and leave me.
<p/>Through the pale darkness of the night loomed a solid black mass of buildings, flung down, as it were, in the vast plain.
<p/>The village of Mokroe numbered two thousand inhabitants, but at that hour all were asleep, and only here and there a few lights still twinkled.
<p/>Farewell and forget your victim ... never fret yourself about me!' '' <div class="bookquote">``Mokroe!''  (<font color='red'><b>Andrey</b></font>)</div>cried Andrey, pointing ahead with his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) whip. ''
<p/>They're not asleep,'' said Andrey again, pointing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) whip to the Plastunovs' inn, which was at the entrance to the village.
<p/>Drive on, Andrey, I come!'' Mitya exclaimed, feverishly. '' The six windows, looking on the street, were all brightly lighted up.
<p/>'' They're not asleep,'' Mitya repeated joyously. '' Quicker, Andrey! Gallop! Drive up with a dash! Set the bells ringing! Let all know that I have come.
<p/>Andrey lashed his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) exhausted team into a gallop, drove with a dash and pulled up his (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) steaming, panting horses at the high flight of steps.
<p/>Mitya jumped out of the cart just as the innkeeper, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) way to bed, peeped out from the steps curious to see who had arrived.
<p/>I'm coming! I'm coming, too!'' '' Trifon Borissovitch, is that you? '' The innkeeper bent down, looked intently, ran down the steps, and rushed up to the guest with obsequious delight.
<p/>'' Dmitri Fyodorovitch, your honor! Do I see you again? '' Trifon Borissovitch was a thick-set, healthy peasant, of middle height, with a rather fat face.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) expression was severe and uncompromising, especially with the peasants of Mokroe, but he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) had the power of assuming the most obsequious countenance, when he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) had an inkling that it was to his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) interest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) dressed in Russian style, with a shirt buttoning down on one side, and a full-skirted coat. He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) had saved a good sum of money, but was for ever dreaming of improving his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) position.
<p/>From the neighboring landowners he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) bought and rented lands which were worked by the peasants, in payment of debts which they could never shake off.
<p/>More than half the peasants were in his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) clutches, every one in the neighborhood was in debt to him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was a widower, with four grown-up daughters.
<p/>One of them was already a widow and lived in the inn with her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) two children, his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) grandchildren, and worked for him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) like a charwoman.
<p/>Another of his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) daughters was married to a petty official, and in one of the rooms of the inn, on the wall could be seen, among the family photographs, a miniature photograph of this official in uniform and official epaulettes.
<p/>The two younger daughters used to wear fashionable blue or green dresses, fitting tight at the back, and with trains a yard long, on Church holidays or when they went to pay visits.
<p/>But next morning they would get up at dawn, as usual, sweep out the rooms with a birch-broom, empty the slops, and clean up after lodgers.
<p/>In spite of the thousands of roubles he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) had saved, Trifon Borissovitch was very fond of emptying the pockets of a drunken guest, and remembering that not a month ago he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) had, in twenty-four hours, made two if not three hundred roubles out of Dmitri,
<p/>when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had come on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) escapade with Grushenka, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) now with eager welcome, scenting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) prey the moment Mitya drove up to the steps.
<p/>'' Dmitri Fyodorovitch, dear sir, we see you once more!'' <div class="bookquote">``Stay, Trifon Borissovitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>began Mitya, <div class="bookquote">``first and foremost, where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)?''

<p/>'' They have been playing, but they've left off. They've been drinking tea, the official gentleman asked for liqueurs.'' <div class="bookquote">``Stay, Trifon Borissovitch, stay, my good soul, I'll see for myself.
<p/>Now answer one more question: are the gypsies here?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You can't have the gypsies now, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. The authorities have sent them away.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Send for them. Certainly send for them! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>cried Mitya. '' And you can get the girls together as you did then, Marya especially, Stepanida, too, and Arina.
<p/>Two hundred roubles for a chorus!'' '' Oh, for a sum like that I can get all the village together, though by now they're asleep.
<p/>Are the peasants here worth such kindness, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, or the girls either? To spend a sum like that on such coarseness and rudeness!
<p/>What's the good of giving a peasant a cigar to smoke, the stinking ruffian! And the girls are all lousy. Besides, I'll get my daughters up for nothing, let alone a sum like that.
<p/>They've only just gone to bed, I'll give them a kick and set them singing for you. You gave the peasants champagne to drink the other day, e--ech!''
<p/>For all his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) pretended compassion for Mitya, Trifon Borissovitch had hidden half a dozen bottles of champagne on that last occasion, and had picked up a hundred-rouble note under the table, and it had remained in his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) clutches.
<p/>'' Trifon Borissovitch, I sent more than one thousand flying last time I was here. Do you remember?'' <div class="bookquote">``You did send it flying.
<p/>I may well remember. You must have left three thousand behind you.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Well, I've come to do the same again, do you see?
<p/>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) roll of notes, and held them up before the innkeeper's nose. '' Now, listen and remember.
<p/>In an hour's time the wine will arrive, savories, pies, and sweets--bring them all up at once. That box Andrey has got is to be brought up at once, too.
<p/>Open it, and hand champagne immediately. And the girls, we must have the girls, Marya especially. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) turned to the cart and pulled out the box of pistols.
<p/>'' Here, Andrey, let's settle. Here's fifteen roubles for the drive, and fifty for vodka ... for your readiness, for your love....
<p/>Remember Karamazov!'' '' I'm afraid, sir,'' faltered Andrey. '' Give me five roubles extra, but more I won't take. Trifon Borissovitch, bear witness.
<p/>Forgive my foolish words ...'' '' What are you afraid of? '' asked Mitya, scanning him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). '' Well, go to the devil, if that's it!
<p/>Now, Trifon Borissovitch, take me up quietly and let me first get a look at them, so that they don't see me.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) cried, flinging him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) five roubles. '' Where are they? In the blue room? '' Trifon Borissovitch looked apprehensively at Mitya, but at once obediently did his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) bidding.
<p/>Leading him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) into the passage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went himself into the first large room, adjoining that in which the visitors were sitting, and took the light away.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) stealthily led Mitya in, and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) in a corner in the dark, whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) could freely watch the company without being seen.
<p/>But Mitya did not look long, and, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) could not see them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heart throbbed violently, and all was dark before his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was sitting sideways to the table in a low chair, and beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), on the sofa, was the pretty youth, Kalganov.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hand and seemed to be laughing, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), seeming vexed and not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), was saying something in a loud voice to Maximov, who sat the other side of the table, facing Grushenka.
<p/>Maximov was laughing violently at something. On the sofa sat he (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) , and on a chair by the sofa there was another stranger.
<p/>The one on the sofa was lolling backwards, smoking a pipe, and Mitya had an impression of a stoutish, broad-faced, short little man, who was apparently angry about something.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) friend, the other stranger, struck Mitya as extraordinarily tall, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) could make out nothing more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) breath.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) could not bear it for a minute, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) put the pistol- case on a chest, and with a throbbing heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) walked, feeling cold all over, straight into the blue room to face the company.
<p/>'' Aie! '' shrieked Grushenka, the first to notice him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). Chapter VII. The First And Rightful Lover With his (<font color='blue'><b>Lover</b></font>) long, rapid strides, Mitya walked straight up to the table.
<p/>'' Gentlemen,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said in a loud voice, almost shouting, yet stammering at every word, ``I ... I'm all right! Don't be afraid!
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``I--there's nothing the matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) turned suddenly to Grushenka, who had shrunk back in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) chair towards Kalganov, and clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hand tightly.
<p/>'' '' I ... I'm coming, too. I'm here till morning. Gentlemen, may I stay with you till morning? Only till morning, for the last time, in this same room?
<p/>'' So he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) finished, turning to the fat little man, with the pipe, sitting on the sofa. The latter removed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pipe from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) lips with dignity and observed severely: '' Panie , we're here in private.
<p/>There are other rooms. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why, it's you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch! What do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kalganov/Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov</b></font>)</div>answered Kalganov suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``Sit down with us.
<p/>How are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Delighted to see you, dear ... and precious fellow, I always thought a lot of you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya responded, joyfully and eagerly, at once holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hand across the table.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) always squeezes like that, always,'' Grushenka put in gayly, with a timid smile, seeming suddenly convinced from Mitya's face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was not going to make a scene.
<p/>'' Aie! How tight you squeeze! You've quite broken my fingers,'' laughed Kalganov. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) with intense curiosity and still some uneasiness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was impressed by something about him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), and indeed the last thing she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) expected of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would come in and speak like this at such a moment.
<p/>'' Good evening,'' Maximov ventured blandly on the left. Mitya rushed up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), too. '' Good evening. You're here, too!
<p/>Gentlemen, gentlemen, I--'' -LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) addressed the Polish gentleman with the pipe again, evidently taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) for the most important person present.-RRB-
<p/>I wanted to spend my last day, my last hour in this room, in this very room ... where I, too, adored ... my queen....
<p/>How glad I am to find you here, too! '' I flew here.... Forgive me, panie ,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cried wildly, <div class="bookquote">``I flew here
<p/>and vowed-- Oh, don't be afraid , it's my last night! Let's drink to our good understanding. They'll bring the wine at once....
<p/>I brought this with me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Something made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pull out his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) bundle of notes.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Allow me, panie ! I want to have music, singing, a revel, as we had before.
<p/>But the worm, the unnecessary worm, will crawl away, and there'll be no more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). I will commemorate my day of joy on my last night.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was almost choking. There was so much, so much he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wanted to say, but strange exclamations were all that came from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) lips.
<p/>The Pole gazed fixedly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), at the bundle of notes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hand; looked at Grushenka, and was in evident perplexity.
<p/>'' If my suverin lady is permitting--'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was beginning. '' What does `suverin' mean? ' Sovereign,' I suppose?'' interrupted Grushenka.
<p/>'' I can't help laughing at you, the way you talk. Sit down, Mitya, what are you talking about? Don't frighten us, please.
<p/>You won't frighten us, will you? If you won't, I am glad to see you ... '' <div class="bookquote">``Me, me frighten you?
<p/>And suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) surprised them all, and no doubt himself as well, by flinging himself on a chair, and bursting into tears, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head away to the opposite wall, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) arms clasped the back of the chair tight, as though embracing it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried Mitya, flinging up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands. '' Oh, pass me by, go your way, I won't hinder you!... '' ''
<p/>Come, come, what a fellow you are!'' cried Grushenka reproachfully. '' That's just how he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) comes to see me--he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) begins talking, and I can't make out what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) means.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) cried like that once before, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s crying again! It's shameful! Why are you crying? As though you had anything to cry for!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) instantly turned round in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) chair, and suddenly laughed, not his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) abrupt wooden laugh, but a long, quivering, inaudible nervous laugh.
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) added enigmatically, emphasizing each word with some irritability. '' I ... I'm not crying.... Well, good evening! '' ''
<p/>Well, there you are again.... Come, cheer up, cheer up!'' Grushenka said to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) persuasively. '' I'm very glad you've come, very glad, Mitya, do you hear, I'm very glad!
<p/>I want him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to stay here with us,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) said peremptorily, addressing the whole company, though her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) words were obviously meant for the man sitting on the sofa.
<p/>'' I wish it, I wish it! And if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes away I shall go, too!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) added with flashing eyes.
<p/>'' What my queen commands is law!'' pronounced the Pole, gallantly kissing Grushenka's hand. '' I beg you, panie , to join our company,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added politely, addressing Mitya.
<p/>Mitya was jumping up with the obvious intention of delivering another tirade, but the words did not come. <div class="bookquote">``Let's drink, panie ,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) blurted out instead of making a speech.
<p/>Every one laughed. '' Good heavens! I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was going to begin again!'' Grushenka exclaimed nervously. '' Do you hear, Mitya,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went on insistently, <div class="bookquote">``don't prance about, but it's nice
<p/>you've brought the champagne. I want some myself, and I can't bear liqueurs. And best of all, you've come yourself. We were fearfully dull here....
<p/>You've come for a spree again, I suppose? But put your money in your pocket. Where did you get such a lot?
<p/>Mitya had been, all this time, holding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hand the crumpled bundle of notes on which the eyes of all, especially of the Poles, were fixed.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>In confusion he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) thrust them hurriedly into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pocket. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) flushed. At that moment the innkeeper brought in an uncorked bottle of champagne, and glasses on a tray.
<p/>Mitya snatched up the bottle, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was so bewildered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) did not know what to do with it. Kalganov took it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) and poured out the champagne.
<p/>Mitya cried to the innkeeper, and, forgetting to clink glasses with the Pole whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had so solemnly invited to drink to their good understanding, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) drank off his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) glass without waiting for any one else.
<p/>The solemn and tragic expression with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had entered vanished completely, and a look of something childlike came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) looked shyly and happily at every one, with a continual nervous little laugh, and the blissful expression of a dog who has done wrong, been punished, and forgiven.
<p/>'' Another! Another bottle!'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) whole countenance suddenly changed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seemed to have become suddenly gentle and subdued. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seemed to have forgotten everything, and was looking round at every one with a childlike smile of delight.
<p/>By degrees he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had gained some idea of the two Poles, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had formed no definite conception of them yet.
<p/>The Pole on the sofa struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) dignified demeanor and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) Polish accent; and, above all, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pipe.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) looked at Grushenka, laughing continually, and bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) chair close up to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>). '' Well, what of it? It's a good thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s smoking a pipe,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) reflected.
<p/>The Pole's puffy, middle-aged face, with its tiny nose and two very thin, pointed, dyed and impudent-looking mustaches, had not so far roused the faintest doubts in Mitya.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was not even particularly struck by the Pole's absurd wig made in Siberia, with love-locks foolishly combed forward over the temples.
<p/>The other, younger Pole, who was staring insolently and defiantly at the company and listening to the conversation with silent contempt, still only impressed Mitya by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) great height, which was in striking contrast to the Pole on the sofa.
<p/>'' I suppose it's all right since he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wears a wig,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went on, musing blissfully. '' If he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) stood up he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'d be six foot three.
<p/>It occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), too, that this Pole must be the friend of the other, as it were, a <div class="bookquote">``bodyguard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pole the friend bodyguard doubt</b></font>)</div>and no doubt the big Pole was at the disposal of the little Pole with the pipe.
<p/>'' The thought flitted through Mitya's mind. But this all seemed to Mitya perfectly right and not to be questioned. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mood of doglike submissiveness all feeling of rivalry had died away.
<p/>All he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) understood, with thrilling heart, was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sit by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>Grushenka's mood and the enigmatic tone of some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) words he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) completely failed to grasp. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was beside himself with delight, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sip her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) glass of champagne.
<p/>The silence of the company seemed somehow to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), however, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) looked round at every one with expectant eyes.
<p/>'' Why are we sitting here though, gentlemen? Why don't you begin doing something?'' his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) smiling eyes seemed to ask. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) keeps talking nonsense, and we were all laughing,'' Kalganov began suddenly, as though divining his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) thought, and pointing to Maximov.
<p/>Mitya immediately stared at Kalganov and then at Maximov. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s talking nonsense? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) laughed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) short, wooden laugh, seeming suddenly delighted at something--<div class="bookquote">``ha ha!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes. Would you believe it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) will have it that all our cavalry officers in the twenties married Polish women.
<p/>Kalganov was well aware of Mitya's attitude to Grushenka, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) guessed about the Pole, too, but that did not so much interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), perhaps did not interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) at all; what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was interested in was Maximov.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) had come here with Maximov by chance, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) met the Poles here at the inn for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) life.
<p/>Grushenka he (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) knew before, and had once been with some one to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had not taken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>).
<p/>But here she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) very affectionately: before Mitya's arrival, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had been making much of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seemed somehow to be unmoved by it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was a boy, not over twenty, dressed like a dandy, with a very charming fair- skinned face, and splendid thick, fair hair.
<p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) fair face looked out beautiful pale blue eyes, with an intelligent and sometimes even deep expression, beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) age indeed, although the young man sometimes looked and talked quite like a child, and was not at all ashamed of it, even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was aware of it himself.
<p/>That's awful rot, isn't it? '' <div class="bookquote">``Polish women? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>repeated Mitya, perfectly ecstatic. As a rule he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was very willful, even capricious, though always friendly.
<p/>Sometimes there was something fixed and obstinate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) expression. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would look at you and listen, seeming all the while to be persistently dreaming over something else.
<p/>Often he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was listless and lazy, at other times he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would grow excited, sometimes, apparently, over the most trivial matters. ''
<p/>Only imagine, I've been taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) about with me for the last four days,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went on, indolently drawling his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) words, quite naturally though, without the slightest affectation.
<p/>That made me take an interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) at the time, and I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) into the country, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) keeps talking such rot
<p/>'' Ever since your brother, do you remember, shoved him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) off the carriage and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) flying. I'm ashamed to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>I'm taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) back.'' '' The gentleman has not seen Polish ladies, and says what is impossible,'' the Pole with the pipe observed to Maximov.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) spoke Russian fairly well, much better, anyway, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) pretended. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) used Russian words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) always distorted them into a Polish form.
<p/>'' But I was married to a Polish lady myself,'' tittered Maximov. '' But did you serve in the cavalry? You were talking about the cavalry.
<p/>'' cried Mitya, listening eagerly, and turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) inquiring eyes to each as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) spoke, as though there were no knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) might hear from each.
<p/>Were you a cavalry officer? '' put in Kalganov at once. '' Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) a cavalry officer indeed? Ha ha! ''
<p/>What I mean is that those pretty Polish ladies ... when they danced the mazurka with our Uhlans ... when one of them dances a mazurka with a Uhlan she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) jumps on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) knee like a kitten ... a little white one ... and the pan -father
<p/>No, you see,'' Maximov turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>). '' and pan -mother look on and allow it.... They allow it ... and next day the Uhlan comes and offers her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) hand....
<p/>The pan is a lajdak !'' the tall Pole on the chair growled suddenly and crossed one leg over the other.
<p/>That's how it is ... offers her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>)!'' Maximov ended, tittering. '' Mitya's eye was caught by his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) huge greased boot, with its thick, dirty sole.
<p/>The dress of both the Poles looked rather greasy. '' Well, now it's lajdak ! What's he (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) scolding about?'' said Grushenka, suddenly vexed.
<p/>Pani Agrippina, what the gentleman saw in Poland were servant girls, and not ladies of good birth,'' the Pole with the pipe observed to Grushenka.
<p/>'' '' You can reckon on that,'' the tall Pole snapped contemptuously. '' What next! Let him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) talk! People talk, why hinder them?
<p/>I'm not hindering them, pani ,'' said the Pole in the wig, with a long look at Grushenka, and relapsing into dignified silence he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sucked his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pipe again.
<p/>It makes it cheerful,'' Grushenka said crossly. '' '' No, no. The Polish gentleman spoke the truth. '' Kalganov got excited again, as though it were a question of vast import.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'s never been in Poland, so how can he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) talk about it? I suppose you weren't married in Poland, were you?''
<p/>Only, a Uhlan had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to Russia before that, my future wife, with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mamma and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) aunt, and another female relation with a grown-up son.
<p/>'' No, in the Province of Smolensk. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) straight from Poland and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) up to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was a lieutenant in our regiment, a very nice young man.
<p/>At first he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) meant to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) himself. But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) didn't marry her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), because she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) turned out to be lame.'' <div class="bookquote">``So you married a lame woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kalganov/Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov</b></font>)</div>cried Kalganov.
<p/>'' Yes. They both deceived me a little bit at the time, and concealed it. I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was hopping; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kept hopping....
<p/>I thought it was for fun.'' '' So pleased she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was going to marry you! '' yelled Kalganov, in a ringing, childish voice.
<p/>'' Yes, so pleased. But it turned out to be quite a different cause. Afterwards, when we were married, after the wedding, that very evening, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) confessed, and very touchingly asked forgiveness. '
<p/>I once jumped over a puddle when I was a child,' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, `and injured my leg.' He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)!'' Kalganov went off into the most childish laughter, almost falling on the sofa.
<p/>Do you know, that's the truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s not lying now,'' exclaimed Kalganov, turning to Mitya; <div class="bookquote">``and do you know, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s been married twice
<p/>Grushenka, too, laughed. Mitya was at the pinnacle of happiness. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>; it's his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) first wife he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s talking about. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) second wife, do you know, ran away, and is alive now.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Is it possible?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>said Mitya, turning quickly to Maximov with an expression of the utmost astonishment. '' Yes. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did run away.
<p/>I've had that unpleasant experience,'' Maximov modestly assented, <div class="bookquote">``with a monsieur . And what was worse, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'d had all my little property transferred to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) beforehand. '
<p/>You're an educated man,' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said to me. ' You can always get your living.' She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) settled my business with that.
<p/>A venerable bishop once said to me: `One of your wives was lame, but the other was too light-footed.' He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Maximov</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen, listen! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Kalganov/Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov</b></font>)</div>cried Kalganov, bubbling over, <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)'s telling lies--and he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) often is--he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)'s only doing it to amuse us all.
<p/>There's no harm in that, is there? You know, I sometimes like him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)'s awfully low, but it's natural to him (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>), eh?
<p/>Don't you think so? Some people are low from self- interest, but he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>)'s simply so, from nature. Only fancy, he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) claims -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was arguing about it all the way yesterday-RRB- that Gogol wrote Dead Souls about him (<font color='blue'><b>Gogol</b></font>).
<p/>Do you remember, there's a landowner called Maximov in it, whom Nozdryov thrashed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) was charged, do you remember, `for inflicting bodily injury with rods on the landowner Maximov in a drunken condition.'
<p/>Would you believe it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) claims that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) was that Maximov and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) was beaten! Now can it be so?
<p/>Tchitchikov made his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) journey, at the very latest, at the beginning of the twenties, so that the dates don't fit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) couldn't have been thrashed then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) couldn't, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>)?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Kalganov/Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov</b></font>)</div>It was difficult to imagine what Kalganov was excited about, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) excitement was genuine. Mitya followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) lead without protest.
<p/>'' Well, but if they did thrash him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cried, laughing. '' It's not that they thrashed me exactly, but what I mean is--'' put in Maximov.
<p/>'' What do you mean? Either they thrashed you or they didn't. '' '' What o'clock is it, panie ?'' the Pole, with the pipe, asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) tall friend, with a bored expression.
<p/>The other shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) shoulders in reply. Neither of them had a watch. '' Why not talk? Let other people talk.
<p/>Mustn't other people talk because you're bored?'' Grushenka flew at him (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) with evident intention of finding fault. Something seemed for the first time to flash upon Mitya's mind.
<p/>This time the Pole answered with unmistakable irritability. '' Pani , I didn't oppose it. I didn't say anything.'' '' All right then.
<p/>Come, tell us your story,'' Grushenka cried to Maximov. '' Why are you all silent?'' '' There's nothing to tell, it's all so foolish,'' answered Maximov at once, with evident satisfaction, mincing a little.
<p/>'' Besides, all that's by way of allegory in Gogol, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gogol</b></font>)'s made all the names have a meaning. Nozdryov was really called Nosov, and Kuvshinikov had quite a different name, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gogol</b></font>) was called Shkvornev.
<p/>Fenardi really was called Fenardi, only he (<font color='blue'><b>Gogol</b></font>) wasn't an Italian but a Russian, and Mamsel Fenardi was a pretty girl with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pretty little legs in tights, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had a little short skirt with spangles, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kept turning round and round, only not for four hours but for four minutes only, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bewitched every one...''
<p/>'' But what were you beaten for? '' cried Kalganov. '' For Piron!'' answered Maximov. '' What Piron?'' cried Mitya. ''
<p/>The famous French writer, Piron. We were all drinking then, a big party of us, in a tavern at that very fair.
<p/>They'd invited me, and first of all I began quoting epigrams. ' Is that you, Boileau? What a funny get-up!' and Boileau answers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boileau</b></font>)'s going to a masquerade
<p/>And they took it to themselves, so I made haste to repeat another, very sarcastic, well known to all educated people:
<p/>, that is to the baths, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boileau</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Boileau</b></font>)! Yes, Sappho and Phaon are we! But one grief is weighing on me.
<p/>You don't know your way to the sea! They were still more offended and began abusing me in the most unseemly way for it.
<p/>And as ill-luck would have it, to set things right, I began telling a very cultivated anecdote about Piron, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Boileau</b></font>) was not accepted into the French Academy, and to revenge himself wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>Boileau</b></font>) own epitaph
<p/>: Ci-gît Piron qui ne fut rien, Pas męme académicien. They seized me and thrashed me.'' '' But what for? What for?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``For my education. People can thrash a man for anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maximov</b></font>)</div>Maximov concluded, briefly and sententiously. '' Eh, that's enough! That's all stupid, I don't want to listen.
<p/>The tall Pole rose upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) feet, and with the haughty air of a man, bored and out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) element, began pacing from corner to corner of the room, his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) hands behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) back.
<p/>I thought it would be amusing,'' Grushenka cut them short, suddenly. Mitya started, and at once left off laughing. '' Ah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) can't sit still,'' said Grushenka, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) contemptuously.
<p/>Mitya began to feel anxious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) noticed besides, that the Pole on the sofa was looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) with an irritable expression.
<p/>'' Panie! '' cried Mitya, <div class="bookquote">``let's drink! and the other pan , too! Let us drink. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>In a flash he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had pulled three glasses towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), and filled them with champagne.
<p/>I shall be delighted, panie ,'' said the Pole on the sofa, with dignity and affable condescension, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) glass.
<p/>'' To Poland, panovie , I drink to your Poland!'' cried Mitya. '' '' And the other pan , what's his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) name?
<p/>Drink, most illustrious, take your glass!'' Mitya urged. '' Pan Vrublevsky,'' put in the Pole on the sofa. Pan Vrublevsky came up to the table, swaying as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) walked.
<p/>'' To Poland, panovie! '' cried Mitya, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) glass. <div class="bookquote">``Hurrah!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>All three drank. Mitya seized the bottle and again poured out three glasses.
<p/>'' Now to Russia, panovie , and let us be brothers!'' <div class="bookquote">``Pour out some for us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>said Grushenka; <div class="bookquote">``I'll drink to Russia, too!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So will I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kalganov/Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov</b></font>)</div>said Kalganov. '' And I would, too ... to Russia, the old grandmother! '' tittered Maximov. '' All!
<p/>All!'' cried Mitya. '' Trifon Borissovitch, some more bottles!'' The other three bottles Mitya had brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) were put on the table.
<p/>Mitya filled the glasses. '' To Russia! Hurrah! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shouted again. All drank the toast except the Poles, and Grushenka tossed off her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) whole glass at once.
<p/>The Poles did not touch theirs. '' How's this, panovie ? '' cried Mitya, <div class="bookquote">``won't you drink it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Pan Vrublevsky took the glass, raised it and said with a resonant voice:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To Russia as she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) was before 1772.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pan Vrublevsky/Vrublevsky</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come, that's better!''  (<font color='red'><b>the Pole</b></font>)</div>cried the other Pole, and they both emptied their glasses at once.
<p/>'' You're fools, you panovie ,'' broke suddenly from Mitya. '' Panie! '' shouted both the Poles, menacingly, setting on Mitya like a couple of cocks.
<p/>Pan Vrublevsky was specially furious. '' Can one help loving one's own country? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shouted. '' Be silent! Don't quarrel!
<p/>I won't have any quarreling! '' cried Grushenka imperiously, and she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) stamped her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) foot on the floor. Her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) face glowed, her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) eyes were shining.
<p/>The effects of the glass she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) had just drunk were apparent. Mitya was terribly alarmed. '' Panovie , forgive me! It was my fault, I'm sorry.
<p/>Vrublevsky, panie Vrublevsky, I'm sorry.'' <div class="bookquote">``Hold your tongue, you, anyway! Sit down, you stupid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>Grushenka scolded with angry annoyance. Every one sat down, all were silent, looking at one another.
<p/>'' Gentlemen, I was the cause of it all,'' Mitya began again, unable to make anything of Grushenka's words. '' Come, why are we sitting here?
<p/>What shall we do ... to amuse ourselves again?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ach, it's certainly anything but amusing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kalganov/Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov</b></font>)</div>Kalganov mumbled lazily. <div class="bookquote">``Let's play faro again, as we did just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maximov</b></font>)</div>Maximov tittered suddenly.
<p/>'' Faro? Splendid! '' cried Mitya. '' If only the panovie --'' <div class="bookquote">``It's lite, panovie ,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Pole</b></font>)</div>the Pole on the sofa responded, as it were unwillingly.
<p/>'' That's true,'' assented Pan Vrublevsky. '' Lite? What do you mean by `lite'?'' asked Grushenka. '' Late, pani ! '
<p/>a late hour' I mean,'' the Pole on the sofa explained. '' It's always late with them. They can never do anything!''
<p/>Grushenka almost shrieked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pole</b></font>) anger. '' They're dull themselves, so they want others to be dull. Before you came, Mitya, they were just as silent and kept turning up their noses at me.''
<p/>'' My goddess!'' cried the Pole on the sofa, <div class="bookquote">``I see you're not well-disposed to me, that's why I'm gloomy. I'm ready, panie ,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Pole</b></font>)</div>added he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), addressing Mitya.
<p/>'' Begin, panie ,'' Mitya assented, pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) notes out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pocket, and laying two hundred-rouble notes on the table.
<p/>'' I want to lose a lot to you. Take your cards. Make the bank.'' <div class="bookquote">``We'll have cards from the landlord, panie ,''  (<font color='red'><b>the Pole</b></font>)</div>said the little Pole, gravely and emphatically.
<p/>'' That's much the best way,'' chimed in Pan Vrublevsky. '' From the landlord? Very good, I understand, let's get them from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>The landlord brought in a new, unopened pack, and informed Mitya that the girls were getting ready, and that the Jews with the cymbals would most likely be here soon; but the cart with the provisions had not yet arrived.
<p/>Mitya jumped up from the table and ran into the next room to give orders, but only three girls had arrived, and Marya was not there yet.
<p/>Cards! '' Mitya shouted to the landlord. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) did not know himself what orders to give and why he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had run out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) only told them to take out of the box the presents for the girls, the sweets, the toffee and the fondants.
<p/>'' And vodka for Andrey, vodka for Andrey! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) cried in haste. '' I was rude to Andrey!'' Suddenly Maximov, who had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) out, touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) on the shoulder.
<p/>'' Give me five roubles,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) whispered to Mitya. '' I'll stake something at faro, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)!'' <div class="bookquote">``Capital! Splendid! Take ten, here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) took all the notes out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pocket and picked out one for ten roubles. '' And if you lose that, come again, come again.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maximov</b></font>)</div>Maximov whispered joyfully, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) ran back again. Mitya, too, returned, apologizing for having kept them waiting. The Poles had already sat down, and opened the pack.
<p/>They looked much more amiable, almost cordial. The Pole on the sofa had lighted another pipe and was preparing to throw.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wore an air of solemnity. '' To your places, gentlemen,'' cried Pan Vrublevsky. '' No, I'm not going to play any more,'' observed Kalganov, <div class="bookquote">``I've lost fifty roubles to them just now.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Kalganov/Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov</b></font>)</div>'' The pan had no luck, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'ll be lucky this time,'' the Pole on the sofa observed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) direction.
<p/>'' How much in the bank? To correspond? '' asked Mitya. '' That's according, panie , maybe a hundred, maybe two hundred, as much as you will stake.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``A million!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>laughed Mitya. '' The Pan Captain has heard of Pan Podvysotsky, perhaps?'' <div class="bookquote">``What Podvysotsky?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In Warsaw there was a bank and any one comes and stakes against it.
<p/>The banker says, ' Panie Podvysotsky, are you laying down the gold, or must we trust to your honor?' `To my honor, panie ,' says Podvysotsky. '
<p/>Podvysotsky comes, sees a thousand gold pieces, stakes against the bank. So much the better.' The banker throws the dice. Podvysotsky wins. '
<p/>Take it, panie ,' says the banker, and pulling out the drawer he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) gives him (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) a million. ' Take it, panie , this is your gain.'
<p/>There was a million in the bank. ' I didn't know that,' says Podvysotsky. ' Panie Podvysotsky,' said the banker, `you pledged your honor and we pledged ours.'
<p/>Podvysotsky took the million.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kalganov/Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov</b></font>)</div>'' That's not true,'' said Kalganov. '' Panie Kalganov, in gentlemanly society one doesn't say such things.
<p/>Forgive me, panie , it's my fault again, he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) would, he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) would give away a million, for honor, for Polish honor.
<p/>'' '' As if a Polish gambler would give away a million!'' cried Mitya, but checked himself at once. '' You see how I talk Polish, ha ha!
<p/>And I put a rouble on the queen, the queen of hearts, the pretty little panienotchka , he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)!'' laughed Maximov, pulling out his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) queen, and, as though trying to conceal it from every one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) moved right up and crossed himself hurriedly under the table.
<p/>Here, I stake ten roubles, the knave leads.'' '' Mitya won. The rouble won, too. '' A corner!'' cried Mitya. ''
<p/>I'll bet another rouble, a `single' stake,'' Maximov muttered gleefully, hugely delighted at having won a rouble. <div class="bookquote">``Lost!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>shouted Mitya. ''
<p/>A `double' on the seven!'' The seven too was trumped. <div class="bookquote">``Stop! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Kalganov/Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov</b></font>)</div>cried Kalganov suddenly. '' Double! Double! '' Mitya doubled his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) stakes, and each time he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) doubled the stake, the card he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) doubled was trumped by the Poles.
<p/>The rouble stakes kept winning. '' On the double!'' shouted Mitya furiously. '' You've lost two hundred, panie . Will you stake another hundred?
<p/>And pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) money out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pocket, Mitya was about to fling two hundred roubles on the queen, but Kalganov covered it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hand.
<p/>'' the Pole on the sofa inquired. '' What? Lost two hundred already? Then another two hundred! All doubles!'' '' That's enough!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shouted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) ringing voice. '' What's the matter? '' Mitya stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). '' That's enough! I don't want you to play any more.
<p/>Don't!'' <div class="bookquote">``Why? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Because I don't. Hang it, come away. That's why. I won't let you go on playing. ''
<p/>Mitya gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) in astonishment. <div class="bookquote">``Give it up, Mitya. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) may be right. You've lost a lot as it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>said Grushenka, with a curious note in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) voice.
<p/>Both the Poles rose from their seats with a deeply offended air. '' Are you joking, panie ? '' said the short man, looking severely at Kalganov.
<p/>'' How dare you!'' Pan Vrublevsky, too, growled at Kalganov. '' Don't dare to shout like that,'' cried Grushenka. '' Ah, you turkey-cocks!
<p/>But something in Grushenka's face suddenly struck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and at the same instant something new flashed into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind--a strange new thought! ''
<p/>Pani Agrippina,'' the little Pole was beginning, crimson with anger, when Mitya suddenly went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) and slapped him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) on the shoulder.
<p/>'' Mitya looked at each of them in turn. '' Most illustrious, two words with you. '' '' What do you want?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In the next room, I've two words to say to you, something pleasant, very pleasant. You'll be glad to hear it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>The little pan was taken aback and looked apprehensively at Mitya. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) agreed at once, however, on condition that Pan Vrublevsky went with them.
<p/>'' The bodyguard? Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) come, and I want him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), too. I must have him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)! '' cried Mitya. '' March, panovie !''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where are you going? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>asked Grushenka, anxiously. '' We'll be back in one moment,'' answered Mitya. There was a sort of boldness, a sudden confidence shining in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) led the Poles, not into the large room where the chorus of girls was assembling and the table was being laid, but into the bedroom on the right, where the trunks and packages were kept, and there were two large beds, with pyramids of cotton pillows on each.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face had looked very different when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) entered the room an hour before. There was a lighted candle on a small deal table in the corner.
<p/>The small man and Mitya sat down to this table, facing each other, while the huge Vrublevsky stood beside them, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) back.
<p/>The Poles looked severe but were evidently inquisitive. '' What can I do for you, panie ? '' lisped the little Pole.
<p/>'' Well, look here, panie , I won't keep you long. There's money for you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) notes. ''
<p/>Would you like three thousand? Take it and go your way. '' The Pole gazed open-eyed at Mitya, with a searching look.
<p/>'' Three thousand, panie ? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) exchanged glances with Vrublevsky. '' Three, panovie , three! Listen, panie , I see you're a sensible man.
<p/>Take three thousand and go to the devil, and Vrublevsky with you--d'you hear? But, at once, this very minute, and for ever.
<p/>You understand that, panie , for ever. Here's the door, you go out of it. What have you got there, a great-coat, a fur coat?
<p/>I'll bring it out to you. They'll get the horses out directly, and then--good-by, panie ! '' Mitya awaited an answer with assurance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had no doubts. An expression of extraordinary resolution passed over the Pole's face. '' And the money, panie ?'' ''
<p/>I'll give you this moment for the journey, and as a first installment, and two thousand five hundred to- morrow, in the town--I swear on my honor, I'll get it, I'll get it at any cost!
<p/>The money, panie ? Five hundred roubles '' cried Mitya. The Poles exchanged glances again. The short man's face looked more forbidding.
<p/>'' Seven hundred, seven hundred, not five hundred, at once, this minute, cash down!'' Mitya added, feeling something wrong. '' What's the matter, panie ?
<p/>Don't you trust me? I can't give you the whole three thousand straight off. If I give it, you may come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to-morrow....
<p/>Besides, I haven't the three thousand with me. I've got it at home in the town,'' faltered Mitya, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) spirit sinking at every word he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) uttered.
<p/>'' Upon my word, the money's there, hidden. '' In an instant an extraordinary sense of personal dignity showed itself in the little man's face.
<p/>You do that, panie ,'' said Mitya, recognizing with despair that all was over, <div class="bookquote">``because you hope to make more out of Grushenka?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>What next?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) asked ironically. '' For shame!'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) spat on the floor. Pan Vrublevsky spat too. '' You're a couple of capons, that's what you are!''
<p/>The little Pole turned as red as a crab, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went out of the room, briskly, as though unwilling to hear another word.
<p/>'' This is a mortal insult!'' Vrublevsky swung out after him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), and Mitya followed, confused and crestfallen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was afraid of Grushenka, afraid that the pan would at once raise an outcry.
<p/>And so indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) did. The Pole walked into the room and threw himself in a theatrical attitude before Grushenka. ''
<p/>Pani Agrippina, I have received a mortal insult! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) exclaimed. But Grushenka suddenly lost all patience, as though they had wounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Pole</b></font>) in the tenderest spot.
<p/>'' Speak Russian! Speak Russian!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Pole</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``not another word of Polish! You used to talk Russian. You can't have forgotten it in five years.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pole</b></font>) was red with passion. '' Pani Agrippina--'' '' My name's Agrafena, Grushenka, speak Russian or I won't listen!'' The Pole gasped with offended dignity, and quickly and pompously delivered himself in broken Russian:
<p/>'' Pani Agrafena, I came here to forget the past and forgive it, to forget all that has happened till to-day--
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Forgive? Came here to forgive me? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Grushenka cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) short, jumping up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Pole</b></font>) seat. '' Just so, pani , I'm not pusillanimous
<p/>, I'm magnanimous. But I was astounded when I saw your lovers. Pan Mitya offered me three thousand, in the other room to depart.
<p/>I spat in the pan's face.'' <div class="bookquote">``What? He (<font color='blue'><b>Russian</b></font>) offered you money for me? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>cried Grushenka, hysterically. '' Is it true, Mitya?
<p/>How dare you? Am I for sale?'' '' Panie, panie! '' yelled Mitya, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Pole</b></font>)'s pure and shining, and I have never been her (<font color='blue'><b>Pole</b></font>) lover!
<p/>It wasn't virtue kept me pure, and it wasn't that I was afraid of Kuzma, but that I might hold up my head when I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>), and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>)'s a scoundrel.
<p/>That's a lie...''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How dare you defend me to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>shrieked Grushenka. '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) did actually refuse the money?''
<p/>'' cried Mitya; <div class="bookquote">``only he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wanted to get the whole three thousand at once, and I could only give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seven hundred straight off.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) took it! He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) took it! '' <div class="bookquote">``I see: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heard I had money, and came here to marry me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pani Agrippina</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Pani Agrippina!'' cried the little Pole. <div class="bookquote">``I'm--a knight, I'm--a nobleman, and not a lajdak . I came here to make you my wife
<p/>and I find you a different woman, perverse and shameless. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, go back where you came from! I'll tell them to turn you out and you'll be turned out,'' cried Grushenka, furious.
<p/>'' I've been a fool, a fool, to have been miserable these five years! And it wasn't for his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) sake, it was my anger made me miserable.
<p/>And this isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) at all! Was he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) like this? It might be his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) father! Where did you get your wig from?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was a falcon, but this is a gander. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) used to laugh and sing to me.... And I've been crying for five years, damned fool, abject, shameless
<p/>I was! '' She (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) sank back in her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) low chair and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) hands. At that instant the chorus of Mokroe began singing in the room on the left--a rollicking dance song.
<p/>The landlord, who had been for some time past inquisitively peeping in at the door, hearing shouts and guessing that his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) guests were quarreling, at once entered the room.
<p/>'' A regular Sodom!'' Vrublevsky roared suddenly. '' Landlord, send the shameless hussies away! '' '' What are you shouting for?
<p/>D'you want to split your throat? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) said, addressing Vrublevsky, with surprising rudeness. <div class="bookquote">``Animal!''  (<font color='red'><b>Pan Vrublevsky/Vrublevsky</b></font>)</div>bellowed Pan Vrublevsky. <div class="bookquote">``Animal? And what sort of cards were you playing with just now?
<p/>I could send you to Siberia for playing with false cards, d'you know that, for it's just the same as false banknotes...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And going up to the sofa he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) fingers between the sofa back and the cushion, and pulled out an unopened pack of cards.
<p/>I gave you a pack and you hid it. You played with marked cards! '' Here's my pack unopened! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) held it up and showed it to all in the room.
<p/>From where I stood I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) slip my pack away, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) in place of it--you're a cheat and not a gentleman!''
<p/>'' '' And I twice saw the pan change a card!'' cried Kalganov. '' How shameful! How shameful! '' exclaimed Grushenka, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) hands, and blushing for genuine shame.
<p/>But before he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had uttered the words, Vrublevsky, with a confused and infuriated face, shook his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) fist at Grushenka, shouting: <div class="bookquote">``You low harlot!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pan Vrublevsky/Vrublevsky</b></font>)</div><p/>Mitya flew at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) at once, clutched him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) in both hands, lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) in the air, and in one instant had carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) into the room on the right, from which they had just come.
<p/>'' Good Lord, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s come to that!'' <div class="bookquote">``I thought so, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>said Mitya. '' I've laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) on the floor, there,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) announced, returning at once, gasping with excitement.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) closed one half of the folding doors, and holding the other ajar called out to the little Pole: <div class="bookquote">``Most illustrious, will you be pleased to retire as well?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Pole</b></font>)</div><p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s struggling, the scoundrel! But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) won't come back, no fear of that!... '' '' My dear Dmitri Fyodorovitch,'' said Trifon Borissovitch, <div class="bookquote">``make them give you back the money you lost.
<p/>It's as good as stolen from you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Trifon Borissovitch/Trifon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't want my fifty roubles back,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kalganov/Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov</b></font>)</div>Kalganov declared suddenly. '' I don't want my two hundred, either,'' cried Mitya, <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't take it for anything!
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) keep it as a consolation.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bravo, Mitya! You're a trump, Mitya!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>cried Grushenka, and there was a note of fierce anger in the exclamation.
<p/>The little pan , crimson with fury but still mindful of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) dignity, was making for the door, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) stopped short and said suddenly, addressing Grushenka: '' Pani , if you want to come with me, come.
<p/>This was a man of character: he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had so good an opinion of himself that after all that had passed, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) still expected that she (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>) would marry him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).
<p/>If not, good-by. '' And swelling with indignation and importance he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) went to the door. Mitya slammed the door after him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>'' Lock it,'' said Kalganov. But the key clicked on the other side, they had locked it from within. '' That's capital!
<p/>'' exclaimed Grushenka relentlessly. '' Serve them right!'' Chapter VIII. Delirium What followed was almost an orgy, a feast to which all were welcome.
<p/>Grushenka was the first to call for wine. '' I want to drink. I want to be quite drunk, as we were before.
<p/>Do you remember, Mitya, do you remember how we made friends here last time!'' Mitya himself was almost delirious, feeling that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) happiness was at hand.
<p/>Tell them to dance, to make merry, `let the stove and cottage dance'; as we had it last time,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) kept exclaiming.
<p/>But Grushenka was continually sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) away from her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>). ``Go and enjoy yourself. She (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) was tremendously excited. And Mitya hastened to obey her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>).
<p/>The room in which they had been sitting till that moment was too small, and was divided in two by cotton curtains, behind which was a huge bed with a puffy feather mattress and a pyramid of cotton pillows.
<p/>The chorus were in the next room. In the four rooms for visitors there were beds. Grushenka settled herself just at the door.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) had sat in the same place to watch the dancing and singing <div class="bookquote">``the time before,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>when they had made merry there.
<p/>All the girls who had come had been there then; the Jewish band with fiddles and zithers had come, too, and at last the long expected cart had arrived with the wines and provisions.
<p/>All sorts of people began coming into the room to look on, peasants and their women, who had been roused from sleep and attracted by the hopes of another marvelous entertainment such as they had enjoyed a month before.
<p/>Mitya set an easy chair for her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>). Mitya bustled about. Mitya remembered their faces, greeting and embracing every one he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) knew.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) uncorked bottles and poured out wine for every one who presented himself. Only the girls were very eager for the champagne.
<p/>Mitya had chocolate made for all the girls, and ordered that three samovars should be kept boiling all night to provide tea and punch for everyone to help himself.
<p/>An absurd chaotic confusion followed, but Mitya was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) natural element, and the more foolish it became, the more his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) spirits rose.
<p/>If the peasants had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) for money at that moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would have pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) notes and given them away right and left.
<p/>The men preferred rum, brandy, and, above all, hot punch. This was probably why the landlord, Trifon Borissovitch, kept hovering about Mitya to protect him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seemed to have given up all idea of going to bed that night; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) drank little, only one glass of punch, and kept a sharp look-out on Mitya's interests after his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) own fashion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) intervened in the nick of time, civilly and obsequiously persuading Mitya not to give away <div class="bookquote">``cigars and Rhine wine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>and, above all, money to the peasants as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had done before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was very indignant, too, at the peasant girls drinking liqueur, and eating sweets. '' They're a lousy lot, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' I'd give them a kick, every one of them, and they'd take it as an honor --that's all they're worth!''
<p/>Mitya remembered Andrey again, and ordered punch to be sent out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). '' I was rude to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) just now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) repeated with a sinking, softened voice.
<p/>Kalganov did not want to drink, and at first did not care for the girls' singing; but after he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had drunk a couple of glasses of champagne
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) became extraordinarily lively, strolling about the room, laughing and praising the music and the songs, admiring every one and everything.
<p/>Maximov, blissfully drunk, never left his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) side. Grushenka, too, was beginning to get drunk. Pointing to Kalganov, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) said to Mitya: <div class="bookquote">``What a dear, charming boy he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div><p/>And Mitya, delighted, ran to kiss Kalganov and Maximov. Oh, great were his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hopes! She (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) had said nothing yet, and seemed, indeed, purposely to refrain from speaking.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) from time to time with caressing and passionate eyes. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) suddenly gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hand and drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) vigorously to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) was sitting at the moment in the low chair by the door. '' How was it you came just now, eh?
<p/>Have you walked in! ... I was frightened. So you wanted to give me up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), did you? Did you really want to?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't want to spoil your happiness!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya faltered blissfully. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) did not need his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) answer. '' Well, go and enjoy yourself ...
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would run away, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) listened to the singing and looked at the dancing, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) eyes followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went.
<p/>But in another quarter of an hour she (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) would call him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) once more and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would run back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>).
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) away once more. '' Don't cry, I'll call you back again. '' '' Come, sit beside me, tell me, how did you hear about me, and my coming here yesterday?
<p/>From whom did you first hear it?'' And Mitya began telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) all about it, disconnectedly, incoherently, feverishly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) spoke strangely, often frowning, and stopping abruptly.
<p/>'' What are you frowning at? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) asked. '' Nothing.... I left a man ill there. I'd give ten years of my life for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to get well, to know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was all right!''
<p/>'' Well, never mind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s ill. So you meant to shoot yourself to- morrow! What a silly boy! What for?
<p/>I like such reckless fellows as you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) lisped, with a rather halting tongue. '' So you would go any length for me, eh?
<p/>Did you really mean to shoot yourself to-morrow, you stupid? No, wait a little. To-morrow I may have something to say to you....
<p/>I won't say it to-day, but to-morrow. You'd like it to be to-day? No, I don't want to to-day. Come, go along now, go and amuse yourself.
<p/>'' Once, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>fellows</b></font>), as it were, puzzled and uneasy. '' Why are you sad? I see you're sad....
<p/>Yes, I see it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) added, looking intently into his (<font color='blue'><b>fellows</b></font>) eyes. '' Though you keep kissing the peasants and shouting, I see something.
<p/>No, be merry. I'm merry; you be merry, too.... I love somebody here. Guess who it is. Ah, look, my boy has fallen asleep, poor dear, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s drunk.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) meant Kalganov. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was, in fact, drunk, and had dropped asleep for a moment, sitting on the sofa. But he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was not merely drowsy from drink; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) felt suddenly dejected, or, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``bored.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was intensely depressed by the girls' songs, which, as the drinking went on, gradually became coarse and more reckless.
<p/>Two girls dressed up as bears, and a lively girl, called Stepanida, with a stick in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand, acted the part of keeper, and began to <div class="bookquote">``show them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>keeper</b></font>)</div><p/>The bears rolled on the ground at last in the most unseemly fashion, amid roars of laughter from the closely-packed crowd of men and women.
<p/>And the dances were as bad. <div class="bookquote">``Look alive, Marya, or you'll get the stick! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well, let them! Let them!'' said Grushenka sententiously, with an ecstatic expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marya</b></font>) face.
<p/>'' When they do get a day to enjoy themselves, why shouldn't folks be happy?'' Kalganov looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had been besmirched with dirt.
<p/>It's swinish, all this peasant foolery,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) murmured, moving away; <div class="bookquote">``it's the game they play when it's light all night in summer.
<p/>It described how a gentleman came and tried his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) luck with the girls, to see whether they would love him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>): The master came to try the girls: Would they love him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), would they not?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) particularly disliked one <div class="bookquote">``new''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>song to a jaunty dance-tune. But the girls could not love the master: He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would beat me cruelly And such love won't do for me.
<p/>Then a gypsy comes along and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), too, tries: The gypsy came to try the girls: Would they love him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), would they not?
<p/>But they couldn't love the gypsy either: He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would be a thief, I fear, And would cause me many a tear.
<p/>And many more men come to try their luck, among them a soldier: The soldier came to try the girls: Would they love him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>), would they not?
<p/>But the soldier is rejected with contempt, in two indecent lines, sung with absolute frankness and producing a furore in the audience.
<p/>The song ends with a merchant: The merchant came to try the girls: Would they love him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>), would they not? And it appears that he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) wins their love because: The merchant will make gold for me
<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) queen I'll gladly be. Kalvanov was positively indignant. '' That's just a song of yesterday,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) said aloud. ''
<p/>They might just as well have had a railwayman or a Jew come to try his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) luck with the girls; they'd have carried all before them.
<p/>And, almost as though it were a personal affront, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) declared, on the spot, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was bored, sat down on the sofa and immediately fell asleep.
<p/>Who writes such things for them? '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) pretty little face looked rather pale, as it fell back on the sofa cushion.
<p/>'' Look how pretty he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) is,'' said Grushenka, taking Mitya up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). '' I was combing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hair just now; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hair's like flax, and so thick...
<p/>'' And, bending over him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) tenderly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) forehead. Kalganov instantly opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) eyes, looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), stood up, and with the most anxious air inquired where was Maximov?
<p/>'' So that's who it is you want. '' Grushenka laughed. '' Stay with me a minute. Mitya, run and find his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) Maximov.
<p/>Maximov, it appeared, could not tear himself away from the girls, only running away from time to time to pour himself out a glass of liqueur.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) had drunk two cups of chocolate. His (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) face was red, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) nose was crimson; his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) eyes were moist and mawkishly sweet.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) ran up and announced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) was going to dance the <div class="bookquote">``sabotičre.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They taught me all those well-bred, aristocratic dances when I was little...''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>No, no, I'm coming to look on, too,'' exclaimed Kalganov, brushing aside in the most naďve way Grushenka's offer to sit with him (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go, go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>), Mitya, and I'll watch from here how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) dances,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>said Grushenka. '' They all went to look on.
<p/>It consisted of nothing but skipping and hopping, kicking up the feet, and at every skip Maximov slapped the upturned sole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) foot.
<p/>Maximov danced his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) dance. But it roused no great admiration in any one but Mitya. Kalganov did not like it at all, but Mitya kissed the dancer.
<p/>'' Thanks. You're tired perhaps? What are you looking for here? Would you like some sweets? A cigar, perhaps?'' <div class="bookquote">``A cigarette.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't you want a drink?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll just have a liqueur.... Have you any chocolates?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, there's a heap of them on the table there.
<p/>Choose one, my dear soul!'' '' I like one with vanilla ... for old people. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)!'' <div class="bookquote">``No, brother, we've none of that special sort.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the old man bent down to whisper in Mitya's ear. '' That girl there, little Marya, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)!
<p/>How would it be if you were to help me make friends with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marya</b></font>)?'' '' So that's what you're after! No, brother, that won't do!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd do no harm to any one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maximov</b></font>)</div>Maximov muttered disconsolately. '' Oh, all right, all right. They only come here to dance and sing, you know, brother.
<p/>But damn it all, wait a bit!... Eat and drink and be merry, meanwhile. Don't you want money?'' <div class="bookquote">``Later on, perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Maximov</b></font>)</div>smiled Maximov.
<p/>'' All right, all right... '' Mitya's head was burning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went outside to the wooden balcony which ran round the whole building on the inner side, overlooking the courtyard.
<p/>The fresh air revived him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) stood alone in a dark corner, and suddenly clutched his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head in both hands. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) scattered thoughts came together; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sensations blended into a whole and threw a sudden light into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mind.
<p/>A fearful and terrible light! '' If I'm to shoot myself, why not now?'' passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mind. '' Why not go for the pistols, bring them here, and here, in this dark dirty corner, make an end?
<p/>A few hours earlier, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had been dashing here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was pursued by disgrace, by the theft he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had committed, and that blood, that blood!...
<p/>'' Almost a minute he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) stood, undecided. But yet it was easier for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) then. Then everything was over: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), given her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) up.
<p/>oh, then his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) death sentence had been easier for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>); at least it had seemed necessary, inevitable, for what had he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to stay on earth for?
<p/>Now one phantom, one terror at least was at an end: that first, rightful lover, that fateful figure had vanished, leaving no trace.
<p/>The terrible phantom had turned into something so small, so comic; it had been carried into the bedroom and locked in.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was gone, for him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)-- But now? Was it the same as then? It would never return. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was ashamed, and from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could see now whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) loved.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had everything to make life happy ... but he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could not go on living , he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could not; oh, damnation!
<p/>'' O God! restore to life the man I knocked down at the fence! Let this fearful cup pass from me!
<p/>Lord, thou hast wrought miracles for such sinners as me! But what, what if the old man's alive? Oh, then the shame of the other disgrace I would wipe away.
<p/>I would restore the stolen money. I'd give it back; I'd get it somehow.... No trace of that shame will remain except in my heart for ever!
<p/>But no, no; oh, impossible cowardly dreams! Oh, damnation! '' Yet there was a ray of light and hope in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) darkness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jumped up and ran back to the room--to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) queen for ever! Was not one moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) love worth all the rest of life, even in the agonies of disgrace?
<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) alone, to see her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), to think of nothing, to forget everything, if only for that night, for an hour, for a moment!''
<p/>This wild question clutched at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart. '' Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned from the balcony into the passage, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came upon the landlord, Trifon Borissovitch.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked gloomy and worried, and fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come to find him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' What is it, Trifon Borissovitch? are you looking for me?''
<p/>'' No, sir. '' The landlord seemed disconcerted. '' Why should I be looking for you? Where have you been?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why do you look so glum?
<p/>You're not angry, are you? Wait a bit, you shall soon get to bed.... What's the time?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' It'll be three o'clock.
<p/>Past three, it must be. '' '' We'll leave off soon. We'll leave off.'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't mention it; it doesn't matter. Keep it up as long as you like...''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What's the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)? '' Mitya wondered for an instant, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) ran back to the room where the girls were dancing.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was not there. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was not in the blue room either; there was no one but Kalganov asleep on the sofa.
<p/>Bent forward, with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head and arms on the bed close by, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was crying bitterly, doing her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) utmost to stifle her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sobs that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) might not be heard.
<p/>Mitya peeped behind the curtain--she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was there. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was sitting in the corner, on a trunk. Seeing Mitya, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) beckoned him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hand tightly.
<p/>'' Mitya, Mitya, I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), you know. How I have loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) these five years, all that time! Did I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) or only my own anger?
<p/>No, him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)! It's a lie that it was my anger I loved and not him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). Mitya, I was only seventeen then; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was so kind to me, so merry; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) used to sing to me....
<p/>Or so it seemed to a silly girl like me.... And now, O Lord, it's not the same man. Even his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) face is not the same; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s different altogether.
<p/>I drove here with Timofey, and all the way I was thinking how I should meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), what I should say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), how we should look at one another.
<p/>My soul was faint, and all of a sudden it was just as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had emptied a pail of dirty water over me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) talked to me like a schoolmaster, all so grave and learned; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) met me so solemnly that I was struck dumb.
<p/>I shouldn't have known him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>). I couldn't get a word in. At first I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was ashamed to talk before his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) great big Pole.
<p/>I sat staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) and wondering why I couldn't say a word to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) now. It must have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wife that ruined him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>); you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) threw me up to get married.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must have changed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) like that. Mitya, how shameful it is! Oh, Mitya, I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed for all my life.
<p/>Curse it, curse it, curse those five years! '' And again she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) burst into tears, but clung tight to Mitya's hand and did not let it go.
<p/>'' Mitya, darling, stay, don't go away. I want to say one word to you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) whispered, and suddenly raised her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>'' Listen, tell me who it is I love? I love one man here. Who is that man? That's what you must tell me.
<p/>'' A smile lighted up her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face that was swollen with weeping, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes shone in the half darkness. ''
<p/>A falcon flew in, and my heart sank. ' Fool! that's the man you love!' That was what my heart whispered to me at once.
<p/>You came in and all grew bright. What's he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) afraid of? I wondered. For you were frightened; you couldn't speak. It's not them
<p/>So Fenya told you, you little stupid, how I called to Alyosha out of the window that I'd loved Mityenka for one hour, and that I was going now to love ... another.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s afraid of-- could you be frightened of any one? It's me he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s afraid of , I thought, only me. Mitya, Mitya, how could I be such a fool as to think I could love any one after you?
<p/>Do you forgive me, Mitya? Do you forgive me or not? Do you love me? Do you love me?'' She (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) jumped up and held him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) with both hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shoulders.
<p/>Mitya, dumb with rapture, gazed into her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) eyes, at her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) face, at her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) smile, and suddenly clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) tightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) arms and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) passionately.
<p/>'' You will forgive me for having tormented you? It was through spite I tormented you all. It was for spite I drove the old man out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind....
<p/>Do you remember how you drank at my house one day and broke the wine-glass? I remembered that and I broke a glass to-day and drank `to my vile heart.'
<p/>Mitya, my falcon, why don't you kiss me? He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) kissed me once, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) draws back and looks and listens.
<p/>Why listen to me? Kiss me, kiss me hard , that's right. If you love, well, then, love! I'll be your slave now, your slave for the rest of my life.
<p/>It's sweet to be a slave. Kiss me! Beat me, ill-treat me, do what you will with me.... And I do deserve to suffer.
<p/>Go along, Mitya, I'll come and have some wine, I want to be drunk, I'm going to get drunk and dance; I must, I must!
<p/>Stay, wait, afterwards, I won't have that... '' she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) suddenly thrust him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) away. '' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) tore herself away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) and disappeared behind the curtain.
<p/>Mitya followed like a drunken man. '' Yes, come what may--whatever may happen now, for one minute I'd give the whole world,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) thought.
<p/>Grushenka did, in fact, toss off a whole glass of champagne at one gulp, and became at once very tipsy. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sat down in the same chair as before, with a blissful smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) face.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) cheeks were glowing, her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lips were burning, her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) flashing eyes were moist; there was passionate appeal in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) eyes. Even Kalganov felt a stir at the heart and went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).
<p/>'' Did you feel how I kissed you when you were asleep just now? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said thickly. '' I'm drunk now, that's what it is....
<p/>And aren't you drunk? And why isn't Mitya drinking? Why don't you drink, Mitya? I'm drunk, and you don't drink...'' <div class="bookquote">``I am drunk!
<p/>I'm drunk as it is ... drunk with you ... and now I'll be drunk with wine, too. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) drank off another glass, and--he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) thought it strange himself--
<p/>that glass made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) completely drunk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was suddenly drunk, although till that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had been quite sober, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) remembered that.
<p/>From that moment everything whirled about him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) were delirious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) walked, laughed, talked to everybody, without knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was doing.
<p/>Only one persistent burning sensation made itself felt continually, <div class="bookquote">``like a red-hot coal in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), sat beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)....
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) became very talkative, kept calling every one to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), and beckoned to different girls out of the chorus. When the girl came up, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) either kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), or made the sign of the cross over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) ran up every minute to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands, <div class="bookquote">``each little finger,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) danced another dance to an old song, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sang himself.
<p/>In another minute she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might have cried. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was greatly amused by the <div class="bookquote">``little old man,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) called Maximov. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) danced with special vigor to the refrain: The little pig says--umph!
<p/>umph! umph! The little calf says--moo, moo, moo, The little duck says--quack, quack, quack, The little goose says--ga, ga, ga.. The hen goes strutting through the porch; Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll say,
<p/>Troo-roo-roo-roo-roo, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll say! '' Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) something, Mitya,'' said Grushenka. <div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) a present, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s poor, you know. Ah, the poor, the insulted!...
<p/>Do you know, Mitya, I shall go into a nunnery. No, I really shall one day, Alyosha said something to me to-day that I shall remember all my life....
<p/>Yes.... But to-day let us dance. To-morrow to the nunnery, but to-day we'll dance. I want to play to-day, good people, and what of it?
<p/>God will forgive us. If I were God, I'd forgive every one: `My dear sinners, from this day forth I forgive you.'
<p/>I'm going to beg forgiveness: `Forgive me, good people, a silly wench.' I'm a beast, that's what I am. But I want to pray.
<p/>I gave a little onion. Wicked as I've been, I want to pray. Mitya, let them dance, don't stop them. Every one in the world is good.
<p/>Every one--even the worst of them. The world's a nice place. Though we're bad the world's all right. We're good and bad, good and bad....
<p/>Come, tell me, I've something to ask you: come here every one, and I'll ask you: Why am I so good?
<p/>You know I am good. I'm very good.... Come, why am I so good? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>So Grushenka babbled on, getting more and more drunk.
<p/>At last she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) announced that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was going to dance, too. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) got up from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) chair, staggering. '' Mitya, don't give me any more wine--if I ask you, don't give it to me.
<p/>Wine doesn't give peace. Everything's going round, the stove, and everything. I want to dance. Let every one see how I dance ... let them see how beautifully I dance....
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pulled a white cambric handkerchief out of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pocket, and took it by one corner in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) right hand, to wave it in the dance.
<p/>Mitya ran to and fro, the girls were quiet, and got ready to break into a dancing song at the first signal.
<p/>Maximov, hearing that Grushenka wanted to dance, squealed with delight, and ran skipping about in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), humming: With legs so slim and sides so trim And its little tail curled tight.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) really meant it. But Grushenka waved her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) handkerchief at him (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) and drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) away. '' Sh-h! Mitya, why don't they come?
<p/>Let every one come ... to look on. Call them in, too, that were locked in.... Why did you lock them in?
<p/>Tell them I'm going to dance. Let them look on, too... '' Mitya walked with a drunken swagger to the locked door, and began knocking to the Poles with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) fist.
<p/>'' Hi, you ... Podvysotskys! Come, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s going to dance. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) calls you.'' '' Lajdak! '' one of the Poles shouted in reply.
<p/>'' You're a lajdak yourself! You're a little scoundrel, that's what you are.'' <div class="bookquote">``Leave off laughing at Poland,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kalganov/Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov</b></font>)</div>said Kalganov sententiously.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) too was drunk. '' Be quiet, boy! If I call him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) a scoundrel, it doesn't mean that I called all Poland so.
<p/>One lajdak doesn't make a Poland. Be quiet, my pretty boy, eat a sweetmeat.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ach, what fellows! As though they were not men.
<p/>Why won't they make friends?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>said Grushenka, and went forward to dance. The chorus broke into <div class="bookquote">``Ah, my porch, my new porch!
<p/>Grushenka flung back her (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>) head, half opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>) lips, smiled, waved her (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>) handkerchief, and suddenly, with a violent lurch, stood still in the middle of the room, looking bewildered.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I'm weak... '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>) said in an exhausted voice. <div class="bookquote">``Forgive me.... I'm weak, I can't.... I'm sorry. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>) bowed to the chorus, and then began bowing in all directions.
<p/>'' I'm sorry.... Forgive me...'' '' The lady's been drinking. The pretty lady has been drinking,'' voices were heard saying. ''
<p/>The lady's drunk too much,'' Maximov explained to the girls, giggling. '' Mitya, lead me away ... take me,'' said Grushenka helplessly.
<p/>Well, now I'll go,'' thought Kalganov, and walking out of the blue room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) closed the two halves of the door after him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>Mitya pounced on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), snatched her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) arms, and carried the precious burden through the curtains. '' But the orgy in the larger room went on and grew louder and louder.
<p/>Mitya laid Grushenka on the bed and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) on the lips. '' Don't touch me... '' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) faltered, in an imploring voice. ''
<p/>Don't touch me, till I'm yours.... I've told you I'm yours, but don't touch me ... spare me.... With them here, with them close, you mustn't.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s here. It's nasty here...'' <div class="bookquote">``I'll obey you! I won't think of it ... I worship you! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>muttered Mitya. ''
<p/>Yes, it's nasty here, it's abominable. '' And still holding her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) arms, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sank on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) knees by the bedside.
<p/>It must be honorable ... it shall be honorable for the future ... and let us be honest, let us be good, not brutes, but good ... take me away, take me far away, do you hear?
<p/>'' I know, though you're a brute, you're generous,'' Grushenka articulated with difficulty. '' I don't want it to be here, but far, far away...''
<p/>'' Oh, yes, yes, it must be!'' said Mitya, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) arms. '' I'll take you and we'll fly away....
<p/>Oh, I'd give my whole life for one year only to know about that blood!'' <div class="bookquote">``What blood? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>asked Grushenka, bewildered.
<p/>'' Nothing,'' muttered Mitya, through his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) teeth. '' Grusha, you wanted to be honest, but I'm a thief. But I've stolen money from Katya....
<p/>Disgrace, a disgrace!'' <div class="bookquote">``From Katya, from that young lady? No, you didn't steal it. Give it her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) back, take it from me....
<p/>Why make a fuss? Now everything of mine is yours. What does money matter? We shall waste it anyway.... Folks like us are bound to waste money.
<p/>But we'd better go and work the land. I want to dig the earth with my own hands. We must work, do you hear?
<p/>Alyosha said so. I won't be your mistress, I'll be faithful to you, I'll be your slave, I'll work for you.
<p/>We'll go to the young lady and bow down to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) together, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may forgive us, and then we'll go away.
<p/>And if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) won't forgive us, we'll go, anyway. Take her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) money and love me.... Don't love her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).... Don't love her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) any more.
<p/>If you love her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), I shall strangle her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).... I'll put out both her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes with a needle...''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I love you. I love only you.
<p/>I'll love you in Siberia... ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why Siberia? Never mind, Siberia, if you like. I don't care ... we'll work ... there's snow in Siberia....
<p/>I love driving in the snow ... and must have bells.... Do you hear, there's a bell ringing? Where is that bell ringing?
<p/>There are people coming.... Now it's stopped. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes, exhausted, and suddenly fell asleep for an instant. There had certainly been the sound of a bell in the distance, but the ringing had ceased.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not notice that the bell had ceased ringing, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) notice that the songs had ceased, and that instead of singing and drunken clamor there was absolute stillness in the house.
<p/>Mitya let his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head sink on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) breast. Grushenka opened her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes. '' What's the matter? Was I asleep? Yes ... a bell ...
<p/>I've been asleep and dreamt I was driving over the snow with bells, and I dozed. I was with some one I loved, with you.
<p/>And far, far away. I was holding you and kissing you, nestling close to you. I was cold, and the snow glistened....
<p/>You know how the snow glistens at night when the moon shines. It was as though I was not on earth.
<p/>I woke up, and my dear one is close to me. How sweet that is!...'' <div class="bookquote">``Close to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>murmured Mitya, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) dress, her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) bosom, her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) hands.
<p/>And suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had a strange fancy: it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was looking straight before her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), not at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), not into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face, but over his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head, with an intent, almost uncanny fixity.
<p/>An expression of wonder, almost of alarm, came suddenly into her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) face. '' Mitya, who is that looking at us? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) whispered.
<p/>Mitya turned, and saw that some one had, in fact, parted the curtains and seemed to be watching them. And not one person alone, it seemed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) jumped up and walked quickly to the intruder. '' Here, come to us, come here,'' said a voice, speaking not loudly, but firmly and peremptorily.
<p/>Mitya passed to the other side of the curtain and stood stock still. The room was filled with people, but not those who had been there before.
<p/>An instantaneous shiver ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) back, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shuddered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) recognized all those people instantly. That tall, stout old man in the overcoat and forage-cap with a cockade--was the police captain, Mihail Makarovitch.
<p/>And that <div class="bookquote">``consumptive-looking''  (<font color='red'><b>deputy</b></font>)</div>trim dandy, <div class="bookquote">``who always has such polished boots'' (<font color='red'><b>deputy</b></font>)</div>--that was the deputy prosecutor. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) has a chronometer worth four hundred roubles; he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) showed it to me.
<p/>Mitya forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) surname though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was the <div class="bookquote">``investigating lawyer,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>from the <div class="bookquote">``school of jurisprudence,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>who had only lately come to the town.
<p/>'' And that small young man in spectacles.... And this man--the inspector of police, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, a man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew well.
<p/>And those fellows with the brass plates on, why are they here? And those other two ... peasants.... And there at the door Kalganov with Trifon Borissovitch... <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen!
<p/>What's this for, gentlemen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Trifon Borissovitch/Trifon</b></font>)</div>began Mitya, but suddenly, as though beside himself, not knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was doing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cried aloud, at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) voice:
<p/>The young man in spectacles moved forward suddenly, and stepping up to Mitya, began with dignity, though hurriedly: ``We have to make ... in brief, I beg you to come this way, this way to the sofa...
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I un--der--stand! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It is absolutely imperative that you should give an explanation.'' <div class="bookquote">``The old man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>cried Mitya frantically. '' The old man and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) blood!...
<p/>I understand. '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sank, almost fell, on a chair close by, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had been mown down by a scythe.
<p/>'' You understand? He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) understands it! Monster and parricide! Your father's blood cries out against you! '' the old captain of police roared suddenly, stepping up to Mitya.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was beside himself, crimson in the face and quivering all over. '' This is impossible!'' cried the small young man.
<p/>'' Mihail Makarovitch, Mihail Makarovitch, this won't do! ... I beg you'll allow me to speak. I should never have expected such behavior from you....
<p/>This is delirium, gentlemen, raving delirium,'' cried the captain of police; ``look at him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>): drunk, at this time of night, in the company of a disreputable woman, with the blood of his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) father on his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) hands...
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg you most earnestly, dear Mihail Makarovitch, to restrain your feelings,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>the prosecutor said in a rapid whisper to the old police captain, <div class="bookquote">``or I shall be forced to resort to--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the police captain</b></font>)</div>'' It's delirium!...'' '' But the little lawyer did not allow him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) to finish. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) turned to Mitya, and delivered himself in a loud, firm, dignified voice:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ex-Lieutenant Karamazov, it is my duty to inform you that you are charged with the murder of your father, Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, perpetrated this night...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) said something more, and the prosecutor, too, put in something, but though Mitya heard them he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) did not understand them.
<p/>The Beginning Of Perhotin's Official Career Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, whom we left knocking at the strong locked gates of the widow Morozov's house, ended, of course, by making himself heard.
<p/>Fenya, who was still excited by the fright she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had had two hours before, and too much <div class="bookquote">``upset''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>to go to bed, was almost frightened into hysterics on hearing the furious knocking at the gate.
<p/>Though she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had herself seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Morozov</b></font>) drive away, she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) fancied that it must be Dmitri Fyodorovitch knocking again, no one else could knock so savagely.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) ran to the house-porter, who had already waked up and gone out to the gate, and began imploring him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) not to open it.
<p/>But having questioned Pyotr Ilyitch, and learned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) wanted to see Fenya on very <div class="bookquote">``important business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Fenya</b></font>)</div>the man made up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind at last to open.
<p/>Pyotr Ilyitch was admitted into Fenya's kitchen, but the girl begged him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to allow the house-porter to be present, <div class="bookquote">``because of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) misgivings.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began questioning her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and at once learnt the most vital fact, that is, that when Dmitri Fyodorovitch had run out to look for Grushenka, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had snatched up a pestle from the mortar, and that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) returned, the pestle was not with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) hands were smeared with blood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) stared at them all with wild eyes. Book IX. The Preliminary Investigation Chapter I. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' And the blood was simply flowing, dripping from him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), dripping!''
<p/>Fenya kept exclaiming. This horrible detail was simply the product of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) disordered imagination. But although not <div class="bookquote">``dripping,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Ilyitch/Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin/Perhotin</b></font>)</div>Pyotr Ilyitch had himself seen those hands stained with blood, and had helped to wash them.
<p/>Moreover, the question he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had to decide was not how soon the blood had dried, but where Dmitri Fyodorovitch had run with the pestle, or rather, whether it really was to Fyodor Pavlovitch's, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) could satisfactorily ascertain.
<p/>Pyotr Ilyitch persisted in returning to this point, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) found out nothing conclusive, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) carried away a conviction that Dmitri Fyodorovitch could have gone nowhere but to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) father's house, and that therefore something must have happened there.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) came back,'' Fenya added with excitement, <div class="bookquote">``I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) the whole story, and then I began asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), `Why have you got blood on your hands, Dmitri Fyodorovitch?' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) answered that that was human blood, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had just killed some one.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Fenya</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) confessed it all to me, and suddenly ran off like a madman. I sat down and began thinking, where's he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) run off to now like a madman?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>)'ll go to Mokroe, I thought, and kill my mistress there. I ran out to beg him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) not to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).
<p/>I was running to his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) lodgings, but I looked at Plotnikov's shop, and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) just setting off, and there was no blood on his (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) hands then.
<p/>After asking some further questions, Pyotr Ilyitch left the house, even more upset and uneasy than he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) had been when he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) entered it.
<p/>The most direct and the easiest thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) to do would have been to go straight to Fyodor Pavlovitch's, to find out whether anything had happened there, and if so, what; and only to go to the police captain, as Pyotr Ilyitch firmly intended doing, when he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had satisfied himself of the fact.
<p/>'' -LRB-Fenya had noticed this and remembered it.-RRB- Fenya's old grandmother confirmed her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) evidence as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) was capable. But the night was dark, Fyodor Pavlovitch's gates were strong, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) would have to knock again.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) acquaintance with Fyodor Pavlovitch was of the slightest, and what if, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had been knocking, they opened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), and nothing had happened?
<p/>Then Fyodor Pavlovitch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) jeering way would go telling the story all over the town, how a stranger, called Perhotin, had broken in upon him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) at midnight to ask if any one had killed him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).
<p/>Yet the feeling that possessed him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was so strong, that though he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) stamped his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) foot angrily and swore at himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) set off again, not to Fyodor Pavlovitch's but to Madame Hohlakov's.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) decided that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) denied having just given Dmitri Fyodorovitch three thousand roubles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) would go straight to the police captain, but if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) admitted having given him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) the money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) would go home and let the matter rest till next morning.
<p/>It is, of course, perfectly evident that there was even more likelihood of causing scandal by going at eleven o'clock at night to a fashionable lady, a complete stranger, and perhaps rousing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bed to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) an amazing question, than by going to Fyodor Pavlovitch.
<p/>But that is just how it is, sometimes, especially in cases like the present one, with the decisions of the most precise and phlegmatic people.
<p/>It would make a scandal. And scandal was what Pyotr Ilyitch dreaded more than anything in the world. Pyotr Ilyitch was by no means phlegmatic at that moment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) remembered all his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) life how a haunting uneasiness gradually gained possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), growing more and more painful and driving him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) on, against his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) will.
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) kept cursing himself, of course, all the way for going to this lady, but <div class="bookquote">``I will get to the bottom of it, I will!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>this lady</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) repeated for the tenth time, grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) teeth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) carried out his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) intention. It was exactly eleven o'clock when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) entered Madame Hohlakov's house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was admitted into the yard pretty quickly, but, in response to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) inquiry whether the lady was still up, the porter could give no answer, except that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was usually in bed by that time.
<p/>'' Ask at the top of the stairs. If the lady wants to receive you, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'ll receive you. If she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) won't, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) won't.
<p/>'' Pyotr Ilyitch went up, but did not find things so easy here. The footman was unwilling to take in his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) name, but finally called a maid.
<p/>Pyotr Ilyitch politely but insistently begged her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) to inform her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) lady that an official, living in the town, called Perhotin, had called on particular business, and that if it were not of the greatest importance he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) would not have ventured to come.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) in those words, in those words exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) asked the girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went away. He (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) remained waiting in the entry.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had felt upset ever since Mitya's visit, and had a presentiment that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would not get through the night without the sick headache which always, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), followed such excitement.
<p/>Madame Hohlakov herself was already in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bedroom, though not yet asleep. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was surprised on hearing the announcement from the maid.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) irritably declined to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), however, though the unexpected visit at such an hour, of an <div class="bookquote">``official living in the town,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>who was a total stranger, roused her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feminine curiosity intensely.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) begged the maid most earnestly to take another message in these very words: <div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had come on business of the greatest importance, and that Madame Hohlakov might have cause to regret it later, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) refused to see him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the maid</b></font>)</div><p/>But this time Pyotr Ilyitch was as obstinate as a mule. <div class="bookquote">``I plunged headlong,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) described it afterwards. The maid, gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) in amazement, went to take his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) message again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) thought a little, asked what he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) looked like, and learned that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``very well dressed, young and so polite.
<p/>Madame Hohlakov was impressed. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>We may note, parenthetically, that Pyotr Ilyitch was a rather good-looking young man, and well aware of the fact.
<p/>Madame Hohlakov made up her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) mind to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) dressing-gown and slippers, but she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) flung a black shawl over her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) shoulders.
<p/>'' The official'' was asked to walk into the drawing-room, the very room in which Mitya had been received shortly before.
<p/>The lady came to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) visitor, with a sternly inquiring countenance, and, without asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to sit down, began at once with the question: <div class="bookquote">``What do you want?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have ventured to disturb you, madam, on a matter concerning our common acquaintance, Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Perhotin began. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) had hardly uttered the name, when the lady's face showed signs of acute irritation.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) almost shrieked, and interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) in a fury: <div class="bookquote">``How much longer am I to be worried by that awful man?
<p/>How dare you, sir, how could you venture to disturb a lady who is a stranger to you, in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own house at such an hour!...
<p/>And to force yourself upon her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to talk of a man who came here, to this very drawing-room, only three hours ago, to murder me, and went stamping out of the room, as no one would go out of a decent house.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cried hysterically. '' Let me tell you, sir, that I shall lodge a complaint against you, that I will not let it pass.
<p/>Kindly leave me at once.... I am a mother.... I ... I-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Murder! then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried to murder you, too?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>If you would kindly listen, madam, for half a moment, I'll explain it all in a couple of words,'' answered Perhotin, firmly.
<p/>At five o'clock this afternoon Dmitri Fyodorovitch borrowed ten roubles from me, and I know for a fact he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had no money.
<p/>Yet at nine o'clock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) came to see me with a bundle of hundred-rouble notes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) hand, about two or three thousand roubles.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) killed somebody else? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Hohlakov</b></font>)</div>Madame Hohlakov asked impulsively. '' '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) hands and face were all covered with blood, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) looked like a madman.
<p/>When I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had got so much money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had just received it from you, that you had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) a sum of three thousand to go to the gold-mines...
<p/>'' Madame Hohlakov's face assumed an expression of intense and painful excitement. '' Good God! He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) must have killed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) old father!
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) cried, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) hands. '' I have never given him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) money, never! Oh, run, run!... Don't say another word!
<p/>Save the old man ... run to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father ... run!'' <div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, madam, then you did not give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money?

I refused to give it him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not appreciate it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran out in a fury, stamping. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rushed at me, but I slipped away.... And let me tell you, as I wish to hide nothing from you now, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) positively spat at me.
<p/>Can you fancy that! But why are we standing? Ah, sit down.'' '' Excuse me, I....'' <div class="bookquote">``Or better run, run, you must run and save the poor old man from an awful death!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has killed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) already?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, good heavens, yes! Then what are we to do now? What do you think we must do now?
<p/>Briefly, but fairly clearly, Pyotr Ilyitch told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ilyitch</b></font>) the history of the affair, that part of it at least which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had himself witnessed.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Meantime she (<font color='blue'><b>Ilyitch</b></font>) had made Pyotr Ilyitch sit down and sat down herself, facing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) described, too, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) visit to Fenya, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ilyitch</b></font>) about the pestle.
<p/>All these details produced an overwhelming effect on the distracted lady, who kept uttering shrieks, and covering her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands...
<p/>'' Would you believe it, I foresaw all this! I have that special faculty, whatever I imagine comes to pass. And how often I've looked at that awful man and always thought, that man will end by murdering me.
<p/>if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hasn't murdered me, but only his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own father, it's only because the finger of God preserved me, and what's more, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was ashamed to murder me because, in this very place, I put the holy ikon from the relics of the holy martyr, Saint Varvara, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) neck....
<p/>And to think how near I was to death at that minute, I went close up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) neck to me!...
<p/>Do you know, Pyotr Ilyitch -LRB-I think you said your name was Pyotr Ilyitch-RRB-, I don't believe in miracles, but that ikon and this unmistakable miracle with me now--that shakes me, and I'm ready to believe in anything you like.
<p/>But I don't know what I'm saying ... and only fancy, with the ikon on his (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) neck he (<font color='blue'><b>Saint</b></font>) spat at me....
<p/>And now it's happened ... that is, Have you heard about Father Zossima?... He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) only spat, it's true, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) didn't murder me and ... he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) dashed away!
<p/>Pyotr Ilyitch got up, and announced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was going straight to the police captain, to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) all about it, and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) thought fit.
<p/>But what shall we do, what must we do now? What do you think? '' '' Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'s an excellent man, excellent!
<p/>Mihail Makarovitch, I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>). Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'s the person to go to. How practical you are, Pyotr Ilyitch! How well you've thought of everything!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Especially as I know the police captain very well, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pyotr Ilyitch/Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin/Perhotin</b></font>)</div>observed Pyotr Ilyitch, who still continued to stand, and was obviously anxious to escape as quickly as possible from the impulsive lady, who would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) say good-by and go away.
<p/>And be sure, be sure,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) prattled on, <div class="bookquote">``to come back and tell me what you see there, and what you find out ... what comes to light ... how they'll try him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) ... and what he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'s condemned to....

<p/>But if you would write three lines with your own hand, stating that you did not give Dmitri Fyodorovitch money, it might, perhaps, be of use ...
<p/>But wait, hadn't I better come with you?'' '' N--no. in case it's needed... '' '' To be sure! '' Madame Hohlakov skipped, delighted, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) bureau.
<p/>'' And you know I'm simply struck, amazed at your resourcefulness, your good sense in such affairs. Are you in the service here?
<p/>I'm delighted to think that you're in the service here!'' And still speaking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) scribbled on half a sheet of notepaper the following lines:

<p/>'' Go, save him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>). It's a noble deed on your part!'' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) made the sign of the cross three times over him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) ran out to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) to the passage. '' How grateful I am to you! You can't think how grateful I am to you for having come to me, first.
<p/>How is it I haven't met you before? I shall feel flattered at seeing you at my house in the future.
<p/>How delightful it is that you are living here!... Such precision! Such practical ability! ... They must appreciate you, they must understand you.
<p/>If there's anything I can do, believe me ... oh, I love young people! I'm in love with young people! The younger generation are the one prop of our suffering country.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) one hope.... Oh, go, go!... '' But Pyotr Ilyitch had already run away or she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would not have let him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) go so soon.
<p/>Yet Madame Hohlakov had made a rather agreeable impression on him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), which had somewhat softened his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) anxiety at being drawn into such an unpleasant affair.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s by no means so elderly,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) thought, feeling pleased, <div class="bookquote">``on the contrary I should have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) daughter.
<p/>Tastes differ, as we all know. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' As for Madame Hohlakov, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was simply enchanted by the young man. ''
<p/>Such sense! such exactness! in so young a man! in our day! and all that with such manners and appearance! People say the young people of to-day are no good for anything, but here's an example!
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) simply forgot this <div class="bookquote">``dreadful affair,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and it was only as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was getting into bed, that, suddenly recalling <div class="bookquote">``how near death she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had been,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) exclaimed: <div class="bookquote">``Ah, it is awful, awful!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I would not, however, have dwelt on such trivial and irrelevant details, if this eccentric meeting of the young official with the by no means elderly widow had not subsequently turned out to be the foundation of the whole career of that practical and precise young man.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) story is remembered to this day with amazement in our town, and I shall perhaps have something to say about it, when I have finished my long history of the Brothers Karamazov.
<p/>'' etc.. But she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) fell at once into a sound, sweet sleep. Chapter II. The Alarm Our police captain, Mihail Makarovitch Makarov, a retired lieutenant- colonel, was a widower and an excellent man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had only come to us three years previously, but had won general esteem, chiefly because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``knew how to keep society together.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was never without visitors, and could not have got on without them. Some one or other was always dining with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never sat down to table without guests.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave regular dinners, too, on all sorts of occasions, sometimes most surprising ones. Though the fare was not recherché , it was abundant.
<p/>The first room his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guests entered was a well-fitted billiard-room, with pictures of English race-horses, in black frames on the walls, an essential decoration, as we all know, for a bachelor's billiard-room.
<p/>The fish-pies were excellent, and the wine made up in quantity for what it lacked in quality. There was card-playing every evening at his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) house, if only at one table.
<p/>But at frequent intervals, all the society of our town, with the mammas and young ladies, assembled at his (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) house to dance.
<p/>Though Mihail Makarovitch was a widower, he (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) did not live alone. His (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>) widowed daughter lived with him (<font color='blue'><b>bachelor</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) two unmarried daughters, grown-up girls, who had finished their education.
<p/>They were of agreeable appearance and lively character, and though every one knew they would have no dowry, they attracted all the young men of fashion to their grandfather's house.
<p/>Mihail Makarovitch was by no means very efficient in his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) work, though he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) performed his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) duties no worse than many others.
<p/>To speak plainly, he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was a man of rather narrow education. His (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) understanding of the limits of his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) administrative power could not always be relied upon.
<p/>It was not so much that he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) failed to grasp certain reforms enacted during the present reign, as that he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) made conspicuous blunders in his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) interpretation of them.
<p/>This was not from any special lack of intelligence, but from carelessness, for he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was always in too great a hurry to go into the subject.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) had not even formed a definite idea of the fundamental principles of the reforms connected with the emancipation of the serfs, and only picked it up, so to speak, from year to year, involuntarily increasing his (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) knowledge by practice.
<p/>'' I have the heart of a soldier rather than of a civilian,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) used to say of himself. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) was himself a landowner.
<p/>Pyotr Ilyitch knew for certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) would meet some of Mihail Makarovitch's visitors there that evening, but he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) didn't know which.
<p/>As it happened, at that moment the prosecutor, and Varvinsky, our district doctor, a young man, who had only just come to us from Petersburg after taking a brilliant degree at the Academy of Medicine, were playing whist at the police captain's.
<p/>Ippolit Kirillovitch, the prosecutor -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was really the deputy prosecutor, but we always called him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) the prosecutor-RRB-, was rather a peculiar man, of about five and thirty, inclined to be consumptive, and married to a fat and childless woman.
<p/>It seemed that all that was wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a better opinion of himself than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ability warranted.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was vain and irritable, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a good intellect, and even a kind heart. And that made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seem constantly uneasy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, moreover, certain higher, even artistic, leanings, towards psychology, for instance, a special study of the human heart, a special knowledge of the criminal and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crime.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cherished a grievance on this ground, considering that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been passed over in the service, and being firmly persuaded that in higher spheres he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not been properly appreciated, and had enemies.
<p/>In gloomy moments he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even threatened to give up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) post, and practice as a barrister in criminal cases. The unexpected Karamazov case agitated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) profoundly:
<p/>Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov, the young investigating lawyer, who had only come from Petersburg two months before, was sitting in the next room with the young ladies.
<p/>People talked about it afterwards and wondered that all the gentlemen should, as though intentionally, on the evening of <div class="bookquote">``the crime''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div>have been gathered together at the house of the executive authority.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a case that might well be talked about all over Russia. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But I am anticipating. Yet it was perfectly simple and happened quite naturally.
<p/>Ippolit Kirillovitch's wife had had toothache for the last two days, and he (<font color='blue'><b>executive</b></font>) was obliged to go out to escape from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) groans.
<p/>Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov had been intending for three days past to drop in that evening at Mihail Makarovitch's, so to speak casually, so as slyly to startle the eldest granddaughter, Olga Mihailovna, by showing that he (<font color='blue'><b>executive</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) secret, that he (<font color='blue'><b>executive</b></font>) knew it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) birthday, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) was trying to conceal it on purpose, so as not to be obliged to give a dance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>executive</b></font>) anticipated a great deal of merriment, many playful jests about her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) age, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) being afraid to reveal it, about his (<font color='blue'><b>executive</b></font>) knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Olga</b></font>) secret and telling everybody, and so on.
<p/>The charming young man was a great adept at such teasing; the ladies had christened him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``the naughty man,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to be delighted at the name.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was extremely well-bred, however, of good family, education and feelings, and, though leading a life of pleasure, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sallies were always innocent and in good taste.
<p/>The doctor, from the very nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being, could not spend an evening except at cards. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was short, and delicate-looking.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was engaged in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) official duties, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always became extraordinarily grave, as though realizing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position and the sanctity of the obligations laid upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a special gift for mystifying murderers and other criminals of the peasant class during interrogation, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not win their respect, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) certainly succeeded in arousing their wonder.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) white, slender, little fingers he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always wore a number of big, glittering rings. Pyotr Ilyitch was simply dumbfounded when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went into the police captain's.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw instantly that every one knew. They had positively thrown down their cards, all were standing up and talking. Even Nikolay Parfenovitch had left the young ladies and run in, looking strenuous and ready for action.
<p/>Pyotr Ilyitch was met with the astounding news that old Fyodor Pavlovitch really had been murdered that evening in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) own house, murdered and robbed.
<p/>Marfa Ignatyevna, the wife of old Grigory, who had been knocked senseless near the fence, was sleeping soundly in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) bed and might well have slept till morning after the draught she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had taken.
<p/>But, all of a sudden she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) waked up, no doubt roused by a fearful epileptic scream from Smerdyakov, who was lying in the next room unconscious.
<p/>The news had only just reached them in the following manner. That scream always preceded his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) fits, and always terrified and upset Marfa Ignatyevna.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could never get accustomed to it. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) jumped up and ran half-awake to Smerdyakov's room. But it was dark there, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could only hear the invalid beginning to gasp and struggle.
<p/>Then Marfa Ignatyevna herself screamed out and was going to call her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, but suddenly realized that when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had got up, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was not beside her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in bed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ran back to the bedstead and began groping with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands, but the bed was really empty. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) must have gone out--where?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) got no answer, of course, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) caught the sound of groans far away in the garden in the darkness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ran to the steps and timidly called him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) listened. The groans were repeated, and it was evident they came from the garden.
<p/>'' Good Lord! Just as it was with Lizaveta Smerdyastchaya! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thought distractedly. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went timidly down the steps and saw that the gate into the garden was open.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) must be out there, poor dear,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thought. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went up to the gate and all at once she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) distinctly heard Grigory calling her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) by name, <div class="bookquote">``Marfa!
<p/>Marfa! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Grigory/Grigory Vassilyevitch</b></font>)</div>in a weak, moaning, dreadful voice. '' Lord, preserve us from harm! '' Marfa Ignatyevna murmured, and ran towards the voice, and that was how she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) found Grigory.
<p/>It appeared later, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had crawled away on coming to himself, and probably had been a long time getting so far, losing consciousness several times.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) not by the fence where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had been knocked down, but about twenty paces off. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) noticed at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was covered with blood, and screamed at the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) voice.
<p/>Grigory was muttering incoherently: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) has murdered ... his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) father murdered.... Why scream , silly ... run ... fetch some one....
<p/>But Marfa continued screaming, and seeing that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) master's window was open and that there was a candle alight in the window, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ran there and began calling Fyodor Pavlovitch.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Grigory/Grigory Vassilyevitch</b></font>)</div>But peeping in at the window, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) saw a fearful sight. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) master was lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) back, motionless, on the floor.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) light-colored dressing-gown and white shirt were soaked with blood. The candle on the table brightly lighted up the blood and the motionless dead face of Fyodor Pavlovitch.
<p/>Terror-stricken, Marfa rushed away from the window, ran out of the garden, drew the bolt of the big gate and ran headlong by the back way to the neighbor, Marya Kondratyevna.
<p/>Both mother and daughter were asleep, but they waked up at Marfa's desperate and persistent screaming and knocking at the shutter.
<p/>Marfa, shrieking and screaming incoherently, managed to tell them the main fact, and to beg for assistance. It happened that Foma had come back from his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) wanderings and was staying the night with them.
<p/>On the way, Marya Kondratyevna remembered that at about eight o'clock she (<font color='blue'><b>Kondratyevna</b></font>) heard a dreadful scream from their garden, and this was no doubt Grigory's scream, <div class="bookquote">``Parricide!
<p/>They got him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) up immediately and all three ran to the scene of the crime. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Grigory scream Parricide</b></font>)</div>uttered when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) caught hold of Mitya's leg.
<p/>'' Some one person screamed out and then was silent,'' Marya Kondratyevna explained as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kondratyevna</b></font>) ran. Running to the place where Grigory lay, the two women with the help of Foma carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) to the lodge.
<p/>They lighted a candle and saw that Smerdyakov was no better, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was writhing in convulsions, his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) eyes fixed in a squint, and that foam was flowing from his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) lips.
<p/>They moistened Grigory's forehead with water mixed with vinegar, and the water revived him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) asked immediately: <div class="bookquote">``Is the master murdered?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Then Foma and both the women ran to the house and saw this time that not only the window, but also the door into the garden was wide open, though Fyodor Pavlovitch had for the last week locked himself in every night and did not allow even Grigory to come in on any pretext.
<p/>Seeing that door open, they were afraid to go in to Fyodor Pavlovitch <div class="bookquote">``for fear anything should happen afterwards. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div>And when they returned to Grigory, the old man told them to go straight to the police captain.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) arrived only five minutes before Pyotr Ilyitch, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) story came, not as his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) own surmise and theory, but as the direct confirmation, by a witness, of the theory held by all, as to the identity of the criminal -LRB-a theory he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had in the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) heart refused to believe till that moment-RRB-.
<p/>Marya Kondratyevna ran there and gave the alarm to the whole party at the police captain's. It was resolved to act with energy.
<p/>The deputy police inspector of the town was commissioned to take four witnesses, to enter Fyodor Pavlovitch's house and there to open an inquiry on the spot, according to the regular forms, which I will not go into here.
<p/>The district doctor, a zealous man, new to his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) work, almost insisted on accompanying the police captain, the prosecutor, and the investigating lawyer.
<p/>I will note briefly that Fyodor Pavlovitch was found to be quite dead, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) skull battered in. But with what?
<p/>And immediately that weapon was found, Grigory, to whom all possible medical assistance was at once given, described in a weak and breaking voice how he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had been knocked down.
<p/>They began looking with a lantern by the fence and found the brass pestle dropped in a most conspicuous place on the garden path.
<p/>Most likely with the same weapon with which Grigory had been attacked. There were no signs of disturbance in the room where Fyodor Pavlovitch was lying.
<p/>But by the bed, behind the screen, they picked up from the floor a big and thick envelope with the inscription: <div class="bookquote">``A present of three thousand roubles for my angel Grushenka, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) is willing to come.
<p/>There were three seals of red sealing-wax on the envelope, but it had been torn open and was empty: the money had been removed.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div>And below had been added by Fyodor Pavlovitch, <div class="bookquote">``For my little chicken. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div>They found also on the floor a piece of narrow pink ribbon, with which the envelope had been tied up.
<p/>One piece of Pyotr Ilyitch's evidence made a great impression on the prosecutor and the investigating magistrate, namely, his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) idea that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would shoot himself before daybreak, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had resolved to do so, had spoken of it to Ilyitch, had taken the pistols, loaded them before him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), written a letter, put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) pocket, etc..
<p/>When Pyotr Ilyitch, though still unwilling to believe in it, threatened to tell some one so as to prevent the suicide, Mitya had answered grinning: <div class="bookquote">``You'll be too late.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>So they must make haste to Mokroe to find the criminal, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) really did shoot himself. '' That's clear, that's clear!
<p/>That's just the way with mad fellows like that: 'I shall kill myself to- morrow, so I'll make merry till I die!'
<p/>'' repeated the prosecutor in great excitement. '' '' The story of how he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had bought the wine and provisions excited the prosecutor more than ever.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) stole fifteen hundred, went at once to have his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) hair curled, and then, without even hiding the money, carrying it almost in his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) hand in the same way, he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) went off to the girls.
<p/>'' Do you remember the fellow that murdered a merchant called Olsufyev, gentlemen? '' All were delayed, however, by the inquiry, the search, and the formalities, etc., in the house of Fyodor Pavlovitch.
<p/>It all took time and so, two hours before starting, they sent on ahead to Mokroe the officer of the rural police, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch Schmertsov, who had arrived in the town the morning before to get his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) pay.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was instructed to avoid raising the alarm when he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) reached Mokroe, but to keep constant watch over the <div class="bookquote">``criminal''  (<font color='red'><b>Mokroe</b></font>)</div>till the arrival of the proper authorities, to procure also witnesses for the arrest, police constables, and so on.
<p/>Mavriky Mavrikyevitch did as he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was told, preserving his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) incognito, and giving no one but his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) old acquaintance, Trifon Borissovitch, the slightest hint of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) secret business.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) just before Mitya met the landlord in the balcony, looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) in the dark, and noticed at once a change in Trifon Borissovitch's face and voice.
<p/>So neither Mitya nor any one else knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was being watched. The box with the pistols had been carried off by Trifon Borissovitch and put in a suitable place.
<p/>Only after four o'clock, almost at sunrise, all the officials, the police captain, the prosecutor, the investigating lawyer, drove up in two carriages, each drawn by three horses.
<p/>The doctor remained at Fyodor Pavlovitch's to make a post-mortem next day on the body. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was particularly interested in the condition of the servant, Smerdyakov.
<p/>Such violent and protracted epileptic fits, recurring continually for twenty-four hours, are rarely to be met with, and are of interest to science,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) declared enthusiastically to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) companions, and as they left they laughingly congratulated him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) find.
<p/>After these long, but I think necessary explanations, we will return to that moment of our tale at which we broke off.
<p/>'' The prosecutor and the investigating lawyer distinctly remembered the doctor's saying that Smerdyakov could not outlive the night. Chapter III.
<p/>The Sufferings Of A Soul, The First Ordeal And so Mitya sat looking wildly at the people round him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), not understanding what was said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) got up, flung up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands, and shouted aloud: <div class="bookquote">``I'm not guilty! I'm not guilty of that blood! I'm not guilty of my father's blood...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had hardly said this, before Grushenka rushed from behind the curtain and flung herself at the police captain's feet.
<p/>I meant to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>). But I'm not guilty. Not I. '' It was my fault! Mine! My wickedness! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) cried, in a heartrending voice, bathed in tears, stretching out her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) clasped hands towards them.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) did it through me. I tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) and drove him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) to it. I tortured that poor old man that's dead, too, in my wickedness, and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to this!
<p/>It's my fault, mine first, mine most, my fault!'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it's your fault! You're the chief criminal! You fury! You harlot!
<p/>You're the most to blame!''  (<font color='red'><b>police</b></font>)</div>shouted the police captain, threatening her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) hand. But he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was quickly and resolutely suppressed.
<p/>The prosecutor positively seized hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>). '' This is absolutely irregular, Mihail Makarovitch! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) cried. '' You are positively hindering the inquiry....
<p/>You're ruining the case... '' he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) almost gasped. <div class="bookquote">``Follow the regular course! Follow the regular course! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Nikolay Parfenovitch/Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov/Nikolay</b></font>)</div>cried Nikolay Parfenovitch, fearfully excited too, <div class="bookquote">``otherwise it's absolutely impossible!...''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nikolay Parfenovitch/Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov/Nikolay</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Judge us together!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>Grushenka cried frantically, still kneeling. <div class="bookquote">``Punish us together. I will go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) now, if it's to death!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Grusha, my life, my blood, my holy one!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) knees beside her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and held her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) tight in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) arms.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) remembered afterwards that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was forcibly dragged away from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) by several men, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was led out, and that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) recovered himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was sitting at the table.
<p/>'' Don't believe her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s not guilty of anything, of any blood, of anything!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) and behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) stood the men with metal plates.
<p/>Facing him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) on the other side of the table sat Nikolay Parfenovitch, the investigating lawyer. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) kept persuading him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) to drink a little water out of a glass that stood on the table.
<p/>Mitya -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) remembered it afterwards-RRB- became suddenly intensely interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) big rings, one with an amethyst, and another with a transparent bright yellow stone, of great brilliance.
<p/>And long afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) remembered with wonder how those rings had riveted his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) attention through all those terrible hours of interrogation, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was utterly unable to tear himself away from them and dismiss them, as things that had nothing to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) position.
<p/>On Mitya's left side, in the place where Maximov had been sitting at the beginning of the evening, the prosecutor was now seated, and on Mitya's right hand, where Grushenka had been, was a rosy-cheeked young man in a sort of shabby hunting-jacket, with ink and paper before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' That will refresh you, that will calm you. Be calm, don't be frightened,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, extremely politely. This was the secretary of the investigating lawyer, who had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) with him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>).
<p/>The police captain was now standing by the window at the other end of the room, beside Kalganov, who was sitting there.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Drink some water,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>said the investigating lawyer softly, for the tenth time. '' I have drunk it, gentlemen, I have ...
<p/>but ... come, gentlemen, crush me, punish me, decide my fate! '' cried Mitya, staring with terribly fixed wide- open eyes at the investigating lawyer.
<p/>'' So you positively declare that you are not guilty of the death of your father, Fyodor Pavlovitch? '' asked the investigating lawyer, softly but insistently.
<p/>'' I am not guilty. I am guilty of the blood of another old man but not of my father's. And I weep for it!
<p/>But it's hard to have to answer for that murder with another, a terrible murder of which I am not guilty....
<p/>I killed, I killed the old man and knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down.... It's a terrible accusation, gentlemen, a knock-down blow. But who has killed my father, who has killed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?
<p/>Who can have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) if I didn't? It's marvelous, extraordinary, impossible.'' '' Yes, who can have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)? '' the investigating lawyer was beginning, but Ippolit Kirillovitch, the prosecutor, glancing at him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>), addressed Mitya.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is alive, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) has recovered, and in spite of the terrible blows inflicted, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) own and your evidence, by you, there seems no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) will live, so the doctor says, at least.''
<p/>'' You need not worry yourself about the old servant, Grigory Vassilyevitch. <div class="bookquote">``Alive? He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)'s alive? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>cried Mitya, flinging up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face beamed. '' Lord, I thank Thee for the miracle Thou has wrought for me, a sinner and evildoer. That's an answer to my prayer.
<p/>I've been praying all night. '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) crossed himself three times. He (<font color='blue'><b>sinner</b></font>) was almost breathless. '' So from this Grigory we have received such important evidence concerning you, that--
<p/>'' The prosecutor would have continued, but Mitya suddenly jumped up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) chair. '' One minute, gentlemen, for God's sake, one minute; I will run to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)--''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, at this moment it's quite impossible,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Nikolay Parfenovitch almost shrieked. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), too, leapt to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) feet. Mitya was seized by the men with the metal plates, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sat down of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) own accord....
<p/>I wanted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) for one minute only; I wanted to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) that it has been washed away, it has gone, that blood that was weighing on my heart all night, and that I am not a murderer now!
<p/>'' Gentlemen, what a pity! Gentlemen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is my betrothed! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) said ecstatically and reverently, looking round at them all.
<p/>'' Oh, thank you, gentlemen! Oh, in one minute you have given me new life, new heart!... That old man used to carry me in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms, gentlemen.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used to wash me in the tub when I was a baby three years old, abandoned by every one, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was like a father to me!...''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Allow me, gentlemen, allow me one minute more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>interposed Mitya, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) elbows on the table and covering his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands.
<p/>'' And so you--'' the investigating lawyer began. '' Let me have a moment to think, let me breathe, gentlemen. All this is horribly upsetting, horribly.
<p/>A man is not a drum, gentlemen!'' <div class="bookquote">``Drink a little more water,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nikolay Parfenovitch/Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov/Nikolay</b></font>)</div>murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch. Mitya took his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face and laughed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) whole bearing was changed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was once more the equal of these men, with all of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was acquainted, as though they had all met the day before, when nothing had happened, at some social gathering.
<p/>We may note in passing that, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) first arrival, Mitya had been made very welcome at the police captain's, but later, during the last month especially, Mitya had hardly called at all, and when the police captain met him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), in the street, for instance, Mitya noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) frowned and only bowed out of politeness.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) acquaintance with the prosecutor was less intimate, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sometimes paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wife, a nervous and fanciful lady, visits of politeness, without quite knowing why, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) always received him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) graciously and had, for some reason, taken an interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) up to the last.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had not had time to get to know the investigating lawyer, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had met him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) and talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) twice, each time about the fair sex.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) eyes were confident. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seemed completely transformed in a moment. '' You're a most skillful lawyer, I see, Nikolay Parfenovitch,'' cried Mitya, laughing gayly, <div class="bookquote">``but I can help you now.
<p/>Oh, gentlemen, I feel like a new man, and don't be offended at my addressing you so simply and directly. I'm rather drunk, too, I'll tell you that frankly.
<p/>I believe I've had the honor and pleasure of meeting you, Nikolay Parfenovitch, at my kinsman Miüsov's. Gentlemen, gentlemen, I don't pretend to be on equal terms with you.
<p/>I understand, of course, in what character I am sitting before you. Oh, of course, there's a horrible suspicion ... hanging over me ... if Grigory has given evidence....
<p/>But to business, gentlemen, I am ready, and we will make an end of it in one moment; for, listen, listen, gentlemen!
<p/>A horrible suspicion! It's awful, awful, I understand that! Since I know I'm innocent, we can put an end to it in a minute.

<p/>Before we go on with our inquiry, I should like, if you will consent to answer, to hear you confirm the statement that you disliked your father, Fyodor Pavlovitch, that you were involved in continual disputes with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Here at least, a quarter of an hour ago, you exclaimed that you wanted to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>): 'I didn't kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>),' you said, '

 (<font color='red'><b>gentlemen</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What is there to explain, gentlemen? '' Mitya shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shoulders sullenly, looking down. '' I have never concealed my feelings.
<p/>All the town knows about it--every one knows in the tavern. Only lately I declared them in Father Zossima's cell.... And the very same day, in the evening I beat my father.
<p/>I nearly killed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and I swore I'd come again and kill him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), before witnesses.... Oh, a thousand witnesses! I've been shouting it aloud for the last month, any one can tell you that!...
<p/>The fact stares you in the face, it speaks for itself, it cries aloud, but feelings, gentlemen, feelings are another matter.
<p/>I know that you are bound by your office, I quite understand that, but that's my affair, my private, intimate affair, yet ... since I haven't concealed my feelings in the past ... in the tavern, for instance, I've talked to every one,
<p/>You see, gentlemen''--Mitya frowned--<div class="bookquote">``it seems to me that about feelings you've no right to question me. so ... so I won't make a secret of it now.
<p/>You see, I understand, gentlemen, that there are terrible facts against me in this business. I told every one that I'd kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), and now, all of a sudden, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s been killed.
<p/>So it must have been me! Ha ha! I can make allowances for you, gentlemen, I can quite make allowances. I'm struck all of a heap myself, for who can have murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), if not I?
<p/>That's what it comes to, isn't it? If not I, who can it be, who? Gentlemen, I want to know , I insist on knowing!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) exclaimed suddenly. '' Where was he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) murdered? How was he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) murdered? How, and with what? Tell me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) asked quickly, looking at the two lawyers.
<p/>We found him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) study, lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) back on the floor, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head battered in,'' said the prosecutor.
<p/>'' '' That's horrible!'' Mitya shuddered and, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) elbows on the table, hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) right hand. ''
<p/>We will continue,'' interposed Nikolay Parfenovitch. '' So what was it that impelled you to this sentiment of hatred? You have asserted in public, I believe, that it was based upon jealousy?''
<p/>'' Well, yes, jealousy. And not only jealousy.'' <div class="bookquote">``Disputes about money?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, about money, too.'' '' There was a dispute about three thousand roubles, I think, which you claimed as part of your inheritance?
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Three thousand! More, more,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>cried Mitya hotly; <div class="bookquote">``more than six thousand, more than ten, perhaps. I told every one so, shouted it at them.
<p/>But I made up my mind to let it go at three thousand. I was desperately in need of that three thousand ...
<p/>so the bundle of notes for three thousand that I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) kept under his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pillow, ready for Grushenka, I considered as simply stolen from me.
<p/>Yes, gentlemen, I looked upon it as mine, as my own property... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>The prosecutor looked significantly at the investigating lawyer, and had time to wink at him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) on the sly.
<p/>You will allow us to note that point and write it down; that you looked upon that money as your own property?''
<p/>I know that's another fact that tells against me, but I'm not afraid of facts and I tell them against myself.
<p/>'' We will return to that subject later,'' said the lawyer promptly. '' <div class="bookquote">``Write it down, by all means. Do you hear?
<p/>Do you know, gentlemen, you take me for a different sort of man from what I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, suddenly gloomy and dejected.
<p/>You have to deal with a man of honor, a man of the highest honor; above all--don't lose sight of it--a man who's done a lot of nasty things, but has always been, and still is, honorable at bottom, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inner being.
<p/>, that I yearned to be honorable, that I was, so to say, a martyr to a sense of honor, seeking for it with a lantern, with the lantern of Diogenes, and yet all my life

<p/>that is like me alone. That was a mistake, like me alone, me alone!... Gentlemen, my head aches ... '' His (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) brows contracted with pain.
<p/>You see, gentlemen, I couldn't bear the look of him (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>), there was something in him (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) ignoble, impudent, trampling on everything sacred, something sneering and irreverent, loathsome, loathsome.
<p/>'' But now that he (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>)'s dead, I feel differently. '' <div class="bookquote">``How do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't feel differently, but I wish I hadn't hated him (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) so.''

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, not penitent, don't write that.

<p/>That's what I mean. Write that down, if you like. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Saying this Mitya became very mournful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had grown more and more gloomy as the inquiry continued.
<p/>Though Grushenka had been removed, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had not been taken far away, only into the room next but one from the blue room, in which the examination was proceeding.
<p/>It was a little room with one window, next beyond the large room in which they had danced and feasted so lavishly.
<p/>At that moment another unexpected scene followed. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was sitting there with no one by her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) but Maximov, who was terribly depressed, terribly scared, and clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) side, as though for security.
<p/>At their door stood one of the peasants with a metal plate on his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) breast. Grushenka was crying, and suddenly her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) grief was too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
<p/>, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) jumped up, flung up her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) arms and, with a loud wail of sorrow, rushed out of the room to him (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>), to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) Mitya, and so unexpectedly that they had not time to stop her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>Mitya, hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cry, trembled, jumped up, and with a yell rushed impetuously to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), not knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was doing.
<p/>But they were not allowed to come together, though they saw one another. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was seized by the arms. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) struggled, and tried to tear himself away.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was seized too, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stretching out her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) arms to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), crying aloud as they carried her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) away.
<p/>When the scene was over, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) came to himself again, sitting in the same place as before, opposite the investigating lawyer, and crying out to them: <div class="bookquote">``What do you want with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?
<p/>It took three or four men to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>). Why do you torment her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s done nothing, nothing!... ''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>The lawyers tried to soothe him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>).
<p/>At last Mihail Makarovitch, who had been absent, came hurriedly into the room, and said in a loud and excited voice to the prosecutor: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s been removed, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s downstairs.
<p/>About ten minutes passed like this. Will you allow me to say one word to this unhappy man, gentlemen? In your presence, gentlemen, in your presence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, my dear fellow,''  (<font color='red'><b>police</b></font>)</div>began the police captain, and there was a look of warm, almost fatherly, feeling for the luckless prisoner on his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) excited face.
<p/>'' By all means, Mihail Makarovitch,'' answered the investigating lawyer. '' In the present case we have nothing against it.'' ''
<p/>I took your Agrafena Alexandrovna downstairs myself, and confided her (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) to the care of the landlord's daughters, and that old fellow Maximov is with her (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) all the time.
<p/>I impressed on her (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) that you have to clear yourself, so she (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) mustn't hinder you, must not depress you, or you may lose your head and say the wrong thing in your evidence.
<p/>And I soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>), do you hear? I soothed and calmed her (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>). In fact, I talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) understood.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>)'s a sensible girl, my boy, a good-hearted girl, she (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) would have kissed my old hands, begging help for you. She (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) sent me herself, to tell you not to worry about her (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>).
<p/>And I must go, my dear fellow, I must go and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) that you are calm and comforted about her (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>).
<p/>I was unfair to her (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) is a Christian soul, gentlemen, yes, I tell you, she (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>)'s a gentle soul, and not to blame for anything.
<p/>And so you must be calm, do you understand? So what am I to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>), Dmitri Fyodorovitch? Will you sit quiet or not?
<p/>The good-natured police captain said a great deal that was irregular, but Grushenka's suffering, a fellow creature's suffering, touched his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) good- natured heart, and tears stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' Mitya jumped up and rushed towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). '' Forgive me, gentlemen, oh, allow me, allow me! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cried. ''
<p/>You've the heart of an angel, an angel, Mihail Makarovitch, I thank you for her (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>). I will, I will be calm, cheerful, in fact.
<p/>Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>), in the kindness of your heart, that I am cheerful, quite cheerful, that I shall be laughing in a minute, knowing that she (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) has a guardian angel like you.
<p/>I shall have done with all this directly, and as soon as I'm free, I'll be with her (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) , she (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>)'ll see, let her (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) wait.
<p/>Gentlemen,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) said, turning to the two lawyers, <div class="bookquote">``now I'll open my whole soul to you; I'll pour out everything. We'll finish this off directly, finish it off gayly.
<p/>We shall laugh at it in the end, shan't we? But, gentlemen, that woman is the queen of my heart. Oh, let me tell you that.
<p/>That one thing I'll tell you now.... I see I'm with honorable men. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is my light, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is my holy one, and if only you knew!
<p/>Did you hear her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cry, `I'll go to death with you'? And what have I, a penniless beggar, done for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?
<p/>How can a clumsy, ugly brute like me, with my ugly face, deserve such love, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is ready to go to exile with me?
<p/>Why such love for me? And how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fell down at your feet for my sake, just now! ... and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s proud and has done nothing!
<p/>How can I help adoring her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), how can I help crying out and rushing to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as I did just now?
<p/>Gentlemen, forgive me! But now, now I am comforted. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyers</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) sank back in his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) chair and, covering his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) hands, burst into tears.
<p/>But they were happy tears. He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) recovered himself instantly. The old police captain seemed much pleased, and the lawyers also. They felt that the examination was passing into a new phase.
<p/>When the police captain went out, Mitya was positively gay. '' Now, gentlemen, I am at your disposal, entirely at your disposal.
<p/>And if it were not for all these trivial details, we should understand one another in a minute. I'm at those details again.
<p/>I'm at your disposal, gentlemen, but I declare that we must have mutual confidence, you in me and I in you, or there'll be no end to it.
<p/>To business, gentlemen, to business, and don't rummage in my soul; don't tease me with trifles, but only ask me about facts and what matters, and I will satisfy you at once.
<p/>I speak in your interests. And damn the details! '' So spoke Mitya. The interrogation began again. Chapter IV. The Second Ordeal
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know how you encourage us, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, by your readiness to answer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nikolay Parfenovitch/Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov/Nikolay</b></font>)</div>said Nikolay Parfenovitch, with an animated air, and obvious satisfaction beaming in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) very prominent, short-sighted, light gray eyes, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had removed his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) spectacles a moment before.
<p/>And you have made a very just remark about the mutual confidence, without which it is sometimes positively impossible to get on in cases of such importance, if the suspected party really hopes and desires to defend himself and is in a position to do so.
<p/>We, on our side, will do everything in our power, and you can see for yourself how we are conducting the case.
<p/>'' You approve, Ippolit Kirillovitch?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) turned to the prosecutor. '' Oh, undoubtedly,'' replied the prosecutor. His (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) tone was somewhat cold, compared with Nikolay Parfenovitch's impulsiveness.
<p/>I will note once for all that Nikolay Parfenovitch, who had but lately arrived among us, had from the first felt marked respect for Ippolit Kirillovitch, our prosecutor, and had become almost his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) bosom friend.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was almost the only person who put implicit faith in Ippolit Kirillovitch's extraordinary talents as a psychologist and orator and in the justice of his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) grievance.
<p/>On the other hand, young Nikolay Parfenovitch was the only person in the whole world whom our <div class="bookquote">``unappreciated''  (<font color='red'><b>Parfenovitch the person</b></font>)</div>prosecutor genuinely liked.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) in Petersburg. On their way to Mokroe they had time to come to an understanding about the present case.
<p/>And now as they sat at the table, the sharp-witted junior caught and interpreted every indication on his (<font color='blue'><b>junior</b></font>) senior colleague's face--half a word, a glance, or a wink.
<p/>'' Gentlemen, only let me tell my own story and don't interrupt me with trivial questions and I'll tell you everything in a moment,'' said Mitya excitedly.
<p/>But before we proceed to listen to your communication, will you allow me to inquire as to another little fact of great interest to us?
<p/>I mean the ten roubles you borrowed yesterday at about five o'clock on the security of your pistols, from your friend, Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin.''
<p/>``Excellent! Thank you. <div class="bookquote">``I pledged them, gentlemen. I pledged them for ten roubles. What more? That's all about it. As soon as I got back to town I pledged them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You got back to town? Then you had been out of town?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>``Yes, I went a journey of forty versts into the country.
<p/>Well, how would it be if you began your story with a systematic description of all you did yesterday, from the morning onwards?
<p/>Allow us, for instance, to inquire why you were absent from the town, and just when you left and when you came back--all those facts.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have asked me like that from the beginning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>cried Mitya, laughing aloud, <div class="bookquote">``and, if you like, we won't begin from yesterday, but from the morning of the day before; then you'll understand
<p/>I went the day before yesterday, gentlemen, to a merchant of the town, called Samsonov, to borrow three thousand roubles from him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) on safe security.
<p/>Didn't you know? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>The prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch exchanged glances. '' '' how, why, and where I went. It was a pressing matter, gentlemen, it was a sudden necessity.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Allow me to interrupt you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div>the prosecutor put in politely. '' Why were you in such pressing need for just that sum, three thousand?''
<p/>Oh, gentlemen, you needn't go into details, how, when and why, and why just so much money, and not so much, and all that rigmarole.
<p/>Mitya said all this with the good-natured but impatient familiarity of a man who is anxious to tell the whole truth and is full of the best intentions.
<p/>'' Why, it'll run to three volumes, and then you'll want an epilogue!'' '' Gentlemen!''--he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) corrected himself hurriedly--<div class="bookquote">``don't be vexed with me for my restiveness, I beg you again.
<p/>Believe me once more, I feel the greatest respect for you and understand the true position of affairs. Don't think I'm drunk.
<p/>It's with me, you know, like the saying: `When he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is sober, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is a fool; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is drunk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is a wise man.'
<p/>But I see, gentlemen, it's not the proper thing to make jokes to you, till we've had our explanation, I mean.
<p/>I'm quite sober now. And, besides, being drunk would be no hindrance. Ha ha! And I've my own dignity to keep up, too.
<p/>I quite understand the difference for the moment. I am, after all, in the position of a criminal, and so, far from being on equal terms with you.
<p/>I can't expect you to pat me on the head for what I did to Grigory, for one can't break old men's heads with impunity.
<p/>And it's your business to watch me. I suppose you'll put me away for him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) for six months, or a year perhaps, in a house of correction.
<p/>I don't know what the punishment is--but it will be without loss of the rights of my rank, without loss of my rank, won't it?
<p/>So you see, gentlemen, I understand the distinction between us.... But you must see that you could puzzle God Himself with such questions. '
<p/>How did you step? Where did you step? When did you step? And on what did you step?' I shall get mixed up, if you go on like this, and you will put it all down against me.
<p/>And even if it's nonsense I'm talking now, let me finish, and you, gentlemen, being men of honor and refinement, will forgive me!
<p/>And what will that lead to? To nothing! I'll finish by asking you, gentlemen, to drop that conventional method of questioning.
<p/>I mean, beginning from some miserable trifle, how I got up, what I had for breakfast, how I spat, and where I spat, and so distracting the attention of the criminal
<p/>, suddenly stun him (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) with an overwhelming question, ' Whom did you murder? Whom did you rob?' Ha ha! That's your regulation method
<p/>, that's where all your cunning comes in. You can put peasants off their guard like that, but not me. I know the tricks.
<p/>I've been in the service, too. Ha ha ha! You're not angry, gentlemen? You forgive my impertinence? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) cried, looking at them with a good-nature that was almost surprising.
<p/>'' It's only Mitya Karamazov, you know, so you can overlook it. It would be inexcusable in a sensible man; but you can forgive it in Mitya.
<p/>Though the prosecutor did not laugh, he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) eyes fixed keenly on Mitya, as though anxious not to miss the least syllable, the slightest movement, the smallest twitch of any feature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face.
<p/>Ha ha!'' Nikolay Parfenovitch listened, and laughed too. '' That's how we have treated you from the beginning,'' said Nikolay Parfenovitch, still laughing.
<p/>We haven't tried to put you out by asking how you got up in the morning and what you had for breakfast.
<p/>I saw it and appreciated it, and I appreciate still more your present kindness to me, an unprecedented kindness, worthy of your noble hearts.
<p/>We three here are gentlemen, and let everything be on the footing of mutual confidence between educated, well-bred people, who have the common bond of noble birth and honor.
<p/>In any case, allow me to look upon you as my best friends at this moment of my life, at this moment when my honor is assailed.
<p/>'' We began, indeed, with questions of the greatest importance.'' <div class="bookquote">``I understand. That's no offense to you, gentlemen, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary.
<p/>You've expressed all that so well, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nikolay Parfenovitch/Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov/Nikolay</b></font>)</div>Nikolay Parfenovitch answered with dignified approbation. '' And enough of those trivial questions, gentlemen, all those tricky questions!'' cried Mitya enthusiastically.
<p/>'' Or there's simply no knowing where we shall get to! Is there?'' <div class="bookquote">``I will follow your sensible advice entirely,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div>the prosecutor interposed, addressing Mitya.
<p/>'' I don't withdraw my question, however. It is now vitally important for us to know exactly why you needed that sum, I mean precisely three thousand.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why I needed it?... Oh, for one thing and another.... Well, it was to pay a debt.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' A debt to whom?''
<p/>Not because I couldn't, or because I shouldn't dare, or because it would be damaging, for it's all a paltry matter and absolutely trifling, but--I won't, because it's a matter of principle: that's my private life, and I won't allow any intrusion into my private life.
<p/>Your question has no bearing on the case, and whatever has nothing to do with the case is my private affair.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That I absolutely refuse to answer, gentlemen. That's my principle. I wanted to pay a debt. I wanted to pay a debt of honor but to whom I won't say.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Allow me to make a note of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div>said the prosecutor. '' By all means. Write down that I won't say, that I won't.
<p/>Write that I should think it dishonorable to say. Ech! you can write it; you've nothing else to do with your time.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Allow me to caution you, sir, and to remind you once more, if you are unaware of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div>the prosecutor began, with a peculiar and stern impressiveness, <div class="bookquote">``that you have a perfect right not to answer the questions put to you now, and we on our side have no right to extort an answer from you, if you decline to give it for one reason or another.
<p/>But it is our duty, on the other hand, in such cases as the present, to explain and set before you the degree of injury you will be doing yourself by refusing to give this or that piece of evidence.
<p/>That is entirely a matter for your personal decision. After which I will beg you to continue.''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen, I'm not angry ...
<p/>I ... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya muttered in a rather disconcerted tone. '' Well, gentlemen, you see, that Samsonov to whom I went then ...
<p/>'' We will, of course, not reproduce his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) account of what is known to the reader already. Mitya was impatiently anxious not to omit the slightest detail.
<p/>At the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was in a hurry to get it over. But as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) evidence it was written down, and therefore they had continually to pull him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) up.
<p/>Mitya disliked this, but submitted; got angry, though still good-humoredly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) did, it is true, exclaim, from time to time, <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen, that's enough to make an angel out of patience!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Or, <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen, it's no good your irritating me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But even though he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) exclaimed he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) still preserved for a time his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) genially expansive mood.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) told them how Samsonov had made a fool of him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) two days before. -LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) had completely realized by now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) had been fooled.-RRB-
<p/>They were at once greatly interested, and even, to Mitya's intense indignation, thought it necessary to write the fact down as a secondary confirmation of the circumstance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had hardly a farthing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pocket at the time.
<p/>The sale of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) watch for six roubles to obtain money for the journey was something new to the lawyers. Little by little Mitya began to grow surly.
<p/>Then, after describing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) journey to see Lyagavy, the night spent in the stifling hut, and so on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) return to the town.
<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) began, without being particularly urged, to give a minute account of the agonies of jealousy he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) endured on Grushenka's account.
<p/>They inquired particularly into the circumstance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) having a place of ambush in Marya Kondratyevna's house at the back of Fyodor Pavlovitch's garden to keep watch on Grushenka, and of Smerdyakov's bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) information.
<p/>Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) jealousy he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) spoke warmly and at length, and though inwardly ashamed at exposing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) most intimate feelings to <div class="bookquote">``public ignominy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>so to speak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) evidently overcame his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shame in order to tell the truth.
<p/>The frigid severity, with which the investigating lawyer, and still more the prosecutor, stared intently at him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) story, disconcerted him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) at last considerably.
<p/>That boy, Nikolay Parfenovitch, to whom I was talking nonsense about women only a few days ago, and that sickly prosecutor are not worth my telling this to,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) reflected mournfully.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was heard with silent attention. They laid particular stress on this, and noted it down. '' '' It's ignominious. '
<p/>Be patient, humble, hold thy peace.' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) wound up his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) reflections with that line. But he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) pulled himself together to go on again.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) came to telling of his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) visit to Madame Hohlakov, he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) regained his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) spirits and even wished to tell a little anecdote of that lady which had nothing to do with the case.
<p/>At last, when he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) described his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) despair and told them how, when he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) left Madame Hohlakov's, he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>)'d <div class="bookquote">``get three thousand if he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had to murder some one to do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>they stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) again and noted down that he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had ``meant to murder some one.
<p/>But the investigating lawyer stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>), and civilly suggested that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) should pass on to <div class="bookquote">``more essential matters. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Mitya let them write it without protest.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) reached the point in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) story when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) learned that Grushenka had deceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) and had returned from Samsonov's as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) there, though she (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) had said that she (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) would stay there till midnight.
<p/>If I didn't kill Fenya then, gentlemen, it was only because I hadn't time,'' broke from him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) suddenly at that point in his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) story.
<p/>Mitya waited gloomily, and was beginning to tell how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) ran into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father's garden when the investigating lawyer suddenly stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>), and opening the big portfolio that lay on the sofa beside him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) brought out the brass pestle.
<p/>'' That, too, was carefully written down. '' Do you recognize this object? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) asked, showing it to Mitya. ''
<p/>Oh, yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) laughed gloomily. '' Of course I recognize it. Let me have a look at it.... Damn it, never mind!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have forgotten to mention it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>observed the investigating lawyer. '' Hang it all, I shouldn't have concealed it from you.
<p/>Do you suppose I could have managed without it? It simply escaped my memory.'' <div class="bookquote">``Be so good as to tell us precisely how you came to arm yourself with it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I will be so good, gentlemen. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>And Mitya described how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) took the pestle and ran. '' But what object had you in view in arming yourself with such a weapon?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What object? No object. I just picked it up and ran off. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What for, if you had no object?''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was feeling more and more ashamed at having told <div class="bookquote">``such people''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) jealousy so sincerely and spontaneously.
<p/>Mitya's wrath flared up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) looked intently at <div class="bookquote">``the boy''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and smiled gloomily and malignantly. '' Bother the pestle! '' broke from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) suddenly.
<p/>But have you ever on previous occasions taken a weapon with you when you went out, since you're afraid of the dark?''
<p/>'' But still--'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, to keep off dogs.... Oh, because it was dark.... In case anything turned up.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Ugh! damn it all, gentlemen!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>cried Mitya, exasperated beyond endurance, and turning to the secretary, crimson with anger, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said quickly, with a note of fury in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) voice: <div class="bookquote">``Write down at once ... at once ... `that I snatched up the pestle to go and kill my father ...
<p/>There's positively no talking to you! Fyodor Pavlovitch ... by hitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) on the head with it!' Well, now are you satisfied, gentlemen?
<p/>We quite understand that you made that statement just now through exasperation with us and the questions we put to you, which you consider trivial, though they are, in fact, essential,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the prosecutor remarked dryly in reply.
<p/>Are your minds relieved? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) said, glaring defiantly at the lawyers. '' '' Well, upon my word, gentlemen! Yes, I took the pestle....
<p/>What does one pick things up for at such moments? I don't know what for. I snatched it up and ran--that's all.
<p/>For to me, gentlemen, passons , or I declare I won't tell you any more. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) elbows on the table and his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) hand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had, in fact, an awful inclination to get up and declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) wouldn't say another word, <div class="bookquote">``not if you hang me for it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) sat sideways to them and gazed at the wall, struggling against a feeling of nausea. <div class="bookquote">``You see, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) said at last, with difficulty controlling himself, <div class="bookquote">``you see.
<p/>I listen to you and am haunted by a dream.... It's a dream I have sometimes, you know.... I often dream it--it's always the same ... that some one is hunting me,
<p/>some one I'm awfully afraid of ... that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>)'s hunting me in the dark, in the night ... tracking me, and I hide somewhere from him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>), behind a door or cupboard, hide in a degrading way, and the worst of it is, he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) always knows where I am,
<p/>but he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) pretends not to know where I am on purpose, to prolong my agony, to enjoy my terror.... That's just what you're doing now.
<p/>It's just like that!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is that the sort of thing you dream about?''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div>inquired the prosecutor. '' Yes, it is. Don't you want to write it down?'' said Mitya, with a distorted smile.
<p/>'' No; no need to write it down. But still you do have curious dreams. '' '' It's not a question of dreams now, gentlemen--this is realism, this is real life!
<p/>I'm a wolf and you're the hunters. Well, hunt him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) down!'' <div class="bookquote">``You are wrong to make such comparisons ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Nikolay Parfenovitch/Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov/Nikolay</b></font>)</div>began Nikolay Parfenovitch, with extraordinary softness.
<p/>'' No, I'm not wrong, not at all!'' Mitya flared up again, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) outburst of wrath had obviously relieved his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heart.
<p/>You may not trust a criminal or a man on trial tortured by your questions, but an honorable man, the honorable impulses of the heart -LRB-I say that boldly!-RRB---no!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grew more good- humored at every word. '' That you must believe you have no right indeed ... but-- Be silent, heart, Be patient, humble, hold thy peace.
<p/>Well, shall I go on? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) broke off gloomily. '' If you'll be so kind,'' answered Nikolay Parfenovitch. Chapter V.
<p/>Though Mitya spoke sullenly, it was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was trying more than ever not to forget or miss a single detail of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) story.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) told them how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had leapt over the fence into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father's garden; how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had gone up to the window; told them all that had passed under the window.
<p/>Clearly, precisely, distinctly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) described the feelings that troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) during those moments in the garden when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) longed so terribly to know whether Grushenka was with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father or not.
<p/>But, strange to say, both the lawyers listened now with a sort of awful reserve, looked coldly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), asked few questions.
<p/>The Third Ordeal Mitya could gather nothing from their faces. '' They're angry and offended,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) thought. '' Well, bother them!
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) described how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mind at last to make the <div class="bookquote">``signal''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father that Grushenka had come, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) should open the window, the lawyers paid no attention to the word <div class="bookquote">``signal,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyers</b></font>)</div>as though they entirely failed to grasp the meaning of the word in this connection: so much so, that Mitya noticed it.
<p/>'' Coming at last to the moment when, seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father peering out of the window, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hatred flared up and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pulled the pestle out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pocket, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) suddenly, as though of design, stopped short.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sat gazing at the wall and was aware that their eyes were fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). '' Well?'' said the investigating lawyer.
<p/>'' You pulled out the weapon and ... and what happened then?'' '' Then? Why, then I murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) ... hit him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) on the head and cracked his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) skull....
<p/>I suppose that's your story. That's it! '' His (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) eyes suddenly flashed. All his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) smothered wrath suddenly flamed up with extraordinary violence in his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) soul.
<p/>'' Our story?'' repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch. '' Well--and yours? '' Mitya dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) eyes and was a long time silent. ''
<p/>Whether it was some one's tears, or my mother prayed to God, or a good angel kissed me at that instant, I don't know.
<p/>My story, gentlemen? Well, it was like this,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) began softly. '' But the devil was conquered. I rushed from the window and ran to the fence.
<p/>My father was alarmed and, for the first time, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saw me then, cried out, and sprang back from the window.
<p/>I ran across the garden to the fence ... and there Grigory caught me, when I was sitting on the fence.
<p/>I remember that very well. '' At that point he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes at last and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) listeners. They seemed to be staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with perfectly unruffled attention.
<p/>A sort of paroxysm of indignation seized on Mitya's soul. '' Why, you're laughing at me at this moment, gentlemen! ''
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) broke off suddenly. '' What makes you think that?'' observed Nikolay Parfenovitch. '' You don't believe one word--that's why! I understand, of course, that I have come to the vital point.
<p/>The old man's lying there now with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) skull broken, while I--after dramatically describing how I wanted to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and how I snatched up the pestle--I suddenly run away from the window.
<p/>A romance! Poetry! As though one could believe a fellow on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) word. Ha ha! You are scoffers, gentlemen! '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) swung round on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) chair so that it creaked.
<p/>And did you notice,'' asked the prosecutor suddenly, as though not observing Mitya's excitement, <div class="bookquote">``did you notice when you ran away from the window, whether the door into the garden was open?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' No, it was not open.'' '' It was not?'' '' It was shut. And who could open it? Bah! the door.
<p/>Wait a bit! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seemed suddenly to bethink himself, and almost with a start: <div class="bookquote">``Why, did you find the door open?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it was open.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, who could have opened it if you did not open it yourselves? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>cried Mitya, greatly astonished.
<p/>The door stood open, and your father's murderer undoubtedly went in at that door, and, having accomplished the crime, went out again by the same door,'' the prosecutor pronounced deliberately, as though chiseling out each word separately.
<p/>The murder was committed in the room and not through the window ; that is absolutely certain from the examination that has been made, from the position of the body and everything.
<p/>'' '' That is perfectly clear. There can be no doubt of that circumstance. '' Mitya was absolutely dumbfounded. '' But that's utterly impossible!''
<p/>I tell you positively, definitely, the door was shut the whole time I was in the garden, and when I ran out of the garden.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cried, completely at a loss. '' I ... I didn't go in.... I only stood at the window and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) through the window.
<p/>That's all, that's all.... I remember to the last minute. And if I didn't remember, it would be just the same.
<p/>I know it, for no one knew the signals except Smerdyakov, and me, and the dead man. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't have opened the door to any one in the world without the signals.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Signals? What signals?''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div>asked the prosecutor, with greedy, almost hysterical, curiosity. He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) instantly lost all trace of his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) reserve and dignity.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) scented an important fact of which he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had known nothing, and was already filled with dread that Mitya might be unwilling to disclose it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) asked the question with a sort of cringing timidity. '' So you didn't know!'' Mitya winked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) with a malicious and mocking smile.
<p/>'' What if I won't tell you? From whom could you find out? No one knew about the signals except my father, Smerdyakov, and me: that was all.
<p/>Heaven knew, too, but it won't tell you. But it's an interesting fact. There's no knowing what you might build on it.
<p/>Ha ha! Take comfort, gentlemen, I'll reveal it. You've some foolish idea in your hearts. You don't know the man you have to deal with!
<p/>You have to do with a prisoner who gives evidence against himself, to his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own damage! Yes, for I'm a man of honor and you--are not.
<p/>'' The prosecutor swallowed this without a murmur. He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was trembling with impatience to hear the new fact. Minutely and diffusely Mitya told them everything about the signals invented by Fyodor Pavlovitch for Smerdyakov.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) told them exactly what every tap on the window meant, tapped the signals on the table, and when Nikolay Parfenovitch said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), Mitya, had tapped the signal
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Grushenka has come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) tapped to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) answered precisely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had tapped that signal, that <div class="bookquote">``Grushenka had come.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So now you can build up your tower,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya broke off, and again turned away from them contemptuously. '' So no one knew of the signals but your dead father, you, and the valet Smerdyakov?
<p/>And no one else? '' Nikolay Parfenovitch inquired once more. '' Yes. The valet Smerdyakov, and Heaven. Write down about Heaven.
<p/>That may be of use. Besides, you will need God yourselves. '' And they had already, of course, begun writing it down.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But if Smerdyakov also knew of these signals and you absolutely deny all responsibility for the death of your father, was it not he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), perhaps, who knocked the signal agreed upon, induced your father to open to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and then ... committed the crime?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div><p/>But while they wrote, the prosecutor said suddenly, as though pitching on a new idea: Mitya turned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) a look of profound irony and intense hatred.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) silent stare lasted so long that it made the prosecutor blink. '' You've caught the fox again,'' commented Mitya at last; <div class="bookquote">``you've got the beast by the tail.
<p/>You thought, of course, that I should jump at that, catch at your prompting, and shout with all my might, `Aie!
<p/>Ha ha! I see through you, Mr. Prosecutor. it's Smerdyakov; he (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>)'s the murderer.' Confess that's what you thought. Confess, and I'll go on.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>But the prosecutor did not confess. He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) tongue and waited. '' You're mistaken. I'm not going to shout '
<p/>It's Smerdyakov,' '' said Mitya. '' And you don't even suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, do you suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is suspected, too.''
<p/>From the very beginning, almost from the moment when I ran out to you from behind the curtain, I've had the thought of Smerdyakov in my mind.
<p/>Mitya fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) eyes on the floor. '' Joking apart,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) brought out gloomily. <div class="bookquote">``Listen. I've been sitting here, shouting that I'm innocent and thinking all the time `Smerdyakov!'
<p/>I can't get Smerdyakov out of my head. In fact, I, too, thought of Smerdyakov just now; but only for a second.
<p/>Almost at once I thought, `No, it's not Smerdyakov.' It's not his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) doing, gentlemen.''  (<font color='red'><b>anybody</b></font>)</div>'' In that case is there anybody else you suspect?
<p/>I don't know any one it could be, whether it's the hand of Heaven or Satan, but ... not Smerdyakov,'' Mitya jerked out with decision.
<p/>'' Nikolay Parfenovitch inquired cautiously. '' '' But what makes you affirm so confidently and emphatically that it's not he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``From my conviction--my impression.
<p/>Because Smerdyakov is a man of the most abject character and a coward. He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>)'s not a coward, he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>)'s the epitome of all the cowardice in the world walking on two legs.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) talked to me, he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) was always trembling for fear I should kill him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>), though I never raised my hand against him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) has the heart of a chicken. He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) fell at my feet and blubbered; he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) has kissed these very boots, literally, beseeching me `not to frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>).'
<p/>Do you hear? ' Not to frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>).' What a thing to say! Why, I offered him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) money. He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>)'s a puling chicken--sickly, epileptic, weak-minded--a child of eight could thrash him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) has no character worth talking about. It's not Smerdyakov, gentlemen. He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) doesn't care for money; he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) wouldn't take my presents.
<p/>Besides, what motive had he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) for murdering the old man? Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>)'s very likely his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) son, you know--his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) natural son. Do you know that?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We have heard that legend. But you are your father's son, too, you know; yet you yourself told every one you meant to murder him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' That's a thrust! And a nasty, mean one, too! I'm not afraid! Oh, gentlemen, isn't it too base of you to say that to my face?
<p/>It's base, because I told you that myself. I not only wanted to murder him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), but I might have done it.
<p/>And, what's more, I went out of my way to tell you of my own accord that I nearly murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>But, you see, I didn't murder him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); you see, my guardian angel saved me--that's what you've not taken into account. And that's why it's so base of you.
<p/>For I didn't kill him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>), I didn't kill him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>)! Do you hear, I did not kill him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>). '' He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) was almost choking.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) had not been so moved before during the whole interrogation. '' And what has he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) told you, gentlemen--Smerdyakov, I mean?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You may ask any question,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div>the prosecutor replied with frigid severity, <div class="bookquote">``any question relating to the facts of the case, and we are, I repeat, bound to answer every inquiry you make.
<p/>We found the servant Smerdyakov, concerning whom you inquire, lying unconscious in his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) bed, in an epileptic fit of extreme severity, that had recurred, possibly, ten times.

The doctor who was with us told us, after seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) may possibly not outlive the night.''
<p/>Well, if that's so, the devil must have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>),'' broke suddenly from Mitya, as though until that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had been asking himself:

<p/>Mitya asked for a rest. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) request was courteously granted. After resting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) story. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was evidently depressed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was exhausted, mortified and morally shaken. To make things worse the prosecutor exasperated him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>), as though intentionally, by vexatious interruptions about <div class="bookquote">``trifling points.
<p/>Scarcely had Mitya described how, sitting on the wall, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had struck Grigory on the head with the pestle, while the old man had hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left leg, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had then jumped down to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), when the prosecutor stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) to describe exactly how he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was sitting on the wall.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Mitya was surprised. '' Oh, I was sitting like this, astride, one leg on one side of the wall and one on the other.''
<p/>'' And the pestle?'' '' The pestle was in my hand. '' ``Not in your pocket? Do you remember that precisely?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you mind sitting on the chair just as you sat on the wall then and showing us just how you moved your arm, and in what direction?''

<p/>You're making fun of me, aren't you? '' asked Mitya, looking haughtily at the speaker; but the latter did not flinch.
<p/>Mitya turned abruptly, sat astride on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) chair, and swung his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) arm. '' This was how I struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)! That's how I knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) down!
<p/>What more do you want?'' <div class="bookquote">``Thank you. May I trouble you now to explain why you jumped down, with what object, and what you had in view?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, hang it!... I jumped down to look at the man I'd hurt ... I don't know what for!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Though you were so excited and were running away?''
<p/>'' Yes, though I was excited and running away.'' <div class="bookquote">``You wanted to help him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Help!... Yes, perhaps I did want to help him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)....

<p/>I jumped down to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face with my handkerchief.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We have seen your handkerchief. Did you hope to restore him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to consciousness?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether I hoped it.

<p/>Well, what then?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I'm not a doctor. I couldn't decide. I ran away thinking I'd killed him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). And now he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s recovered.
<p/>it never entered Mitya's head to tell them, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) remembered it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had jumped back from pity, and standing over the prostrate figure had even uttered some words of regret: <div class="bookquote">``You've come to grief, old man--there's no help for it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Excellent,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div>commented the prosecutor. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you. That's all I wanted. Kindly proceed. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Alas! Well, there you must lie. ''
<p/>The prosecutor could only draw one conclusion: that the man had jumped back <div class="bookquote">``at such a moment and in such excitement simply with the object of ascertaining whether the only witness of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) crime were dead; that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) must therefore have been a man of great strength, coolness, decision and foresight even at such a moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>... and so on.
<p/>The prosecutor was satisfied: <div class="bookquote">``I've provoked the nervous fellow by `trifles' and he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) has said more than he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) meant to. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>The prosecutor</b></font>)</div><p/>How came you to run to the servant, Fedosya Markovna, with your hands so covered with blood, and, as it appears, your face, too?''
<p/>With painful effort Mitya went on. But this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was pulled up immediately by Nikolay Parfenovitch. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why, I didn't notice the blood at all at the time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>answered Mitya.
<p/>'' That's quite likely. It does happen sometimes. '' The prosecutor exchanged glances with Nikolay Parfenovitch. '' I simply didn't notice.
<p/>You're quite right there, prosecutor,'' Mitya assented suddenly. Next came the account of Mitya's sudden determination to <div class="bookquote">``step aside''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>and make way for their happiness.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) could not make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mind to open his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heart to them as before, and tell them about ``the queen of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) soul.
<p/>And so in response to their reiterated questions he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) answered briefly and abruptly: <div class="bookquote">``Well, I made up my mind to kill myself.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) disliked speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) before these chilly persons <div class="bookquote">``who were fastening on him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) like bugs. ''  (<font color='red'><b>these persons</b></font>)</div>What had I left to live for?
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) first rightful lover had come back, the man who wronged her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) but who'd hurried back to offer his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love, after five years, and atone for the wrong with marriage....
<p/>That question stared me in the face. So I knew it was all over for me.... And behind me disgrace, and that blood--Grigory's....
<p/>So I went to redeem the pistols I had pledged, to load them and put a bullet in my brain to-morrow.''
<p/>What had I to live for? <div class="bookquote">``And a grand feast the night before?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, a grand feast the night before. Damn it all, gentlemen!
<p/>I meant to shoot myself not far from here, beyond the village, and I'd planned to do it at five o'clock in the morning.
<p/>Do make haste and finish it. And I had a note in my pocket already. I wrote it at Perhotin's when I loaded my pistols.
<p/>Here's the letter. Read it! It's not for you I tell it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) added contemptuously. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) took it from his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) waistcoat pocket and flung it on the table.
<p/>The lawyers read it with curiosity, and, as is usual, added it to the papers connected with the case. '' And you didn't even think of washing your hands at Perhotin's?
<p/>Suspicion or not, I should have galloped here just the same, and shot myself at five o'clock, and you wouldn't have been in time to do anything.
<p/>If it hadn't been for what's happened to my father, you would have known nothing about it, and wouldn't have come here.
<p/>You were not afraid then of arousing suspicion?'' <div class="bookquote">``What suspicion? Oh, it's the devil's doing. It was the devil murdered father, it was through the devil that you found it out so soon.
<p/>Mr. Perhotin informed us that when you came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Perhotin</b></font>), you held in your hands ... your blood-stained hands ... your money ... a lot of money ... a bundle of hundred-rouble notes, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Perhotin</b></font>) servant-boy saw it too.''

<p/>Can you inform us,'' Nikolay Parfenovitch began, with extreme gentleness, <div class="bookquote">``where did you get so much money all of a sudden, when it appears from the facts, from the reckoning of time, that you had not been home?''

<p/>'' '' Yes, gentlemen, I was in want of it, and suddenly thousands turned up, eh? Do you know, gentlemen, you're both afraid now `what if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) won't tell us where he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) got it?'
<p/>That's just how it is. I'm not going to tell you, gentlemen. You've guessed right. You'll never know,'' said Mitya, chipping out each word with extraordinary determination.
<p/>You must understand, Mr. Karamazov, that it is of vital importance for us to know,'' said Nikolay Parfenovitch, softly and suavely.
<p/>The prosecutor, too, intervened, and again reminded the prisoner that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was at liberty to refuse to answer questions, if he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) thought it to his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) interest, and so on.
<p/>But in view of the damage he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) might do himself by his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) silence, especially in a case of such importance as--
<p/>The lawyers were silent for a moment. '' '' I understand; but still I won't tell you. '' <div class="bookquote">``And so on, gentlemen, and so on.

<p/>Enough! I've heard that rigmarole before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya interrupted again. '' '' '' What is it to us? It's not our business, but yours.
<p/>You see, gentlemen, joking apart''--Mitya lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) eyes and looked firmly at them both--<div class="bookquote">``I had an inkling from the first that we should come to loggerheads at this point.
<p/>But at first when I began to give my evidence, it was all still far away and misty; it was all floating, and I was so simple that I began with the supposition of mutual confidence existing between us.
<p/>Now I can see for myself that such confidence is out of the question, for in any case we were bound to come to this cursed stumbling- block.
<p/>You are doing yourself harm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>observed Nikolay Parfenovitch nervously. '' And now we've come to it! It's impossible and there's an end of it!
<p/>But I don't blame you. You can't believe it all simply on my word. I understand that, of course. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>yourself</b></font>) relapsed into gloomy silence.
<p/>Couldn't you, without abandoning your resolution to be silent about the chief point, could you not, at the same time, give us some slight hint as to the nature of the motives which are strong enough to induce you to refuse to answer, at a crisis so full of danger to you?
<p/>'' '' Mitya smiled mournfully, almost dreamily. '' I'm much more good-natured than you think, gentlemen. I'll tell you the reason why and give you that hint, though you don't deserve it.
<p/>The answer to the question where I got the money would expose me to far greater disgrace than the murder and robbing of my father, if I had murdered and robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>I won't speak of that, gentlemen, because it would be a stain on my honor. That's why I can't tell you.
<p/>I can't for fear of disgrace. What, gentlemen, are you going to write that down?'' '' Yes, we'll write it down,'' lisped Nikolay Parfenovitch.
<p/>'' You ought not to write that down about `disgrace.' I only told you that in the goodness of my heart.
<p/>I needn't have told you. I made you a present of it, so to speak, and you pounce upon it at once.
<p/>Oh, well, write--write what you like ,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) concluded, with scornful disgust. '' I'm not afraid of you and I can still hold up my head before you.''
<p/>'' And can't you tell us the nature of that disgrace?'' Nikolay Parfenovitch hazarded. The prosecutor frowned darkly. '' No, no, c'est fini , don't trouble yourselves.
<p/>It's not worth while soiling one's hands. I have soiled myself enough through you as it is. You're not worth it--no one is ...
<p/>Enough, gentlemen. I'm not going on. '' This was said too peremptorily. Nikolay Parfenovitch did not insist further, but from Ippolit Kirillovitch's eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had not given up hope.
<p/>'' Can you not, at least, tell us what sum you had in your hands when you went into Mr. Perhotin's--
<p/>how many roubles exactly?'' <div class="bookquote">``I can't tell you that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You spoke to Mr. Perhotin, I believe, of having received three thousand from Madame Hohlakov.''

<p/>But I'll tell you if you like. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Perhotin</b></font>) proceeded to do so, but we won't repeat his (<font color='blue'><b>Perhotin</b></font>) story. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perhotin</b></font>) told it dryly and curtly.
<p/>Of the raptures of his (<font color='blue'><b>Perhotin</b></font>) love he (<font color='blue'><b>Perhotin</b></font>) said nothing, but told them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Perhotin</b></font>) abandoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Perhotin</b></font>) determination to shoot himself, owing to <div class="bookquote">``new factors in the case.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Perhotin</b></font>) told the story without going into motives or details. And this time the lawyers did not worry him (<font color='blue'><b>Perhotin</b></font>) much.
<p/>We will come back to it during the examination of the witnesses, which will, of course, take place in your presence,'' said Nikolay Parfenovitch in conclusion.
<p/>It was obvious that there was no essential point of interest to them here. '' We shall verify all that. ''
<p/>And now allow me to request you to lay on the table everything in your possession, especially all the money you still have about you.''
<p/>'' My money, gentlemen? Certainly. I understand that that is necessary. I'm surprised, indeed, that you haven't inquired about it before.
<p/>It's true I couldn't get away anywhere. I'm sitting here where I can be seen. But here's my money--count it--take it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) turned it all out of his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) pockets; even the small change--two pieces of twenty copecks--he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) pulled out of his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) waistcoat pocket.
<p/>That's all, I think. '' They counted the money, which amounted to eight hundred and thirty-six roubles, and forty copecks. ''
<p/>And is that all? '' asked the investigating lawyer. '' Yes.'' <div class="bookquote">``You stated just now in your evidence that you spent three hundred roubles at Plotnikovs'.

<p/>They recollected every farthing and included it in the reckoning. Nikolay Parfenovitch hurriedly added up the total. '' With this eight hundred you must have had about fifteen hundred at first?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>snapped Mitya. '' How is it they all assert there was much more?'' <div class="bookquote">``Let them assert it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>''

'' '' As you like,'' Mitya submitted gloomily; <div class="bookquote">``only, please, not here, but behind the curtains.
<p/>Who will search them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Behind the curtains, of course. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Nikolay Parfenovitch/Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov/Nikolay</b></font>)</div>Nikolay Parfenovitch bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head in assent. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) small face wore an expression of peculiar solemnity.
<p/>Chapter VI. The Prosecutor Catches Mitya Something utterly unexpected and amazing to Mitya followed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) could never, even a minute before, have conceived that any one could behave like that to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), Mitya Karamazov.
<p/>It was nothing to take off his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) coat, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was asked to undress further, or rather not asked but <div class="bookquote">``commanded,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) quite understood that.
<p/>What was worst of all, there was something humiliating in it, and on their side something <div class="bookquote">``supercilious and scornful. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>From pride and contempt he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) submitted without a word.
<p/>Several peasants accompanied the lawyers and remained on the same side of the curtain. '' To be ready if force is required,'' thought Mitya, <div class="bookquote">``and perhaps for some other reason, too.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was busily engaged with the prosecutor in examining the coat, the trousers, the waistcoat and the cap; and it was evident that they were both much interested in the scrutiny.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>'' Well, must I take off my shirt, too? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) asked sharply, but Nikolay Parfenovitch did not answer. ''
<p/>They make no bones about it,'' thought Mitya, <div class="bookquote">``they don't keep up the most elementary politeness. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I ask you for the second time--need I take off my shirt or not?
<p/>We will tell you what to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nikolay Parfenovitch/Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov/Nikolay</b></font>)</div>Nikolay Parfenovitch said, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) voice was positively peremptory, or so it seemed to Mitya.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said, still more sharply and irritably. '' Don't trouble yourself. Meantime a consultation was going on in undertones between the lawyers.
<p/>There turned out to be on the coat, especially on the left side at the back, a huge patch of blood, dry, and still stiff.
<p/>Nikolay Parfenovitch, moreover, in the presence of the peasant witnesses, passed his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) fingers along the collar, the cuffs, and all the seams of the coat and trousers, obviously looking for something--money, of course.
<p/>There were bloodstains on the trousers, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) didn't even hide from Mitya his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) suspicion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was capable of sewing money up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) clothes.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) treats me not as an officer but as a thief,'' Mitya muttered to himself. They communicated their ideas to one another with amazing frankness.
<p/>The secretary, for instance, who was also behind the curtain, fussing about and listening, called Nikolay Parfenovitch's attention to the cap, which they were also fingering.
<p/>Last summer he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) received the wages of the whole office, and pretended to have lost the money when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was drunk.
<p/>'' You remember Gridyenko, the copying-clerk,'' observed the secretary. '' And where was it found? Why, in just such pipings in his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) cap.
<p/>Both the lawyers remembered Gridyenko's case perfectly, and so laid aside Mitya's cap, and decided that all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) clothes must be more thoroughly examined later.
<p/>Excuse me,'' cried Nikolay Parfenovitch, suddenly, noticing that the right cuff of Mitya's shirt was turned in, and covered with blood, <div class="bookquote">``excuse me, what's that, blood?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div><p/>The hundred-rouble notes were screwed up in little rolls and sewed in the piping. '' '' '' Yes,'' Mitya jerked out.
<p/>Mitya told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had got the sleeve stained with blood looking after Grigory, and had turned it inside when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was washing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands at Perhotin's.
<p/>'' That is, what blood? ... and why is the cuff turned in?'' '' You must take off your shirt, too.
<p/>That's very important as material evidence. '' Mitya flushed red and flew into a rage. '' What, am I to stay naked?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shouted. '' Don't disturb yourself. We will arrange something. And meanwhile take off your socks.'' '' You're not joking?
<p/>Is that really necessary?'' Mitya's eyes flashed. '' We are in no mood for joking,'' answered Nikolay Parfenovitch sternly. '' Well, if I must--'' muttered Mitya, and sitting down on the bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) socks.
<p/>All were clothed, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was naked, and strange to say, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was undressed he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) felt somehow guilty in their presence, and was almost ready to believe himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was inferior to them, and that now they had a perfect right to despise him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>When all are undressed, one is somehow not ashamed, but when one's the only one undressed and everybody is looking, it's degrading,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) kept repeating to himself, again and again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) felt unbearably awkward. '' '' It's like a dream, I've sometimes dreamed of being in such degrading positions. '' It was a misery to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to take off his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) socks.
<p/>They were very dirty, and so were his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) underclothes, and now every one could see it. And what was worse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) disliked his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) feet.
<p/>All his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had thought both his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) big toes hideous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) particularly loathed the coarse, flat, crooked nail on the right one, and now they would all see it.
<p/>Feeling intolerably ashamed made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), at once and intentionally, rougher. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shirt, himself. '' Would you like to look anywhere else if you're not ashamed to?''
<p/>'' No, there's no need to, at present. '' <div class="bookquote">``Well, am I to stay naked like this? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) added savagely.
<p/>'' Yes, that can't be helped for the time.... Kindly sit down here for a while. You can wrap yourself in a quilt from the bed, and I ...
<p/>The report of the search was drawn up, and at last Nikolay Parfenovitch went out, and the clothes were carried out after him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>I'll see to all this. '' All the things were shown to the witnesses. Ippolit Kirillovitch went out, too. Mitya was left alone with the peasants, who stood in silence, never taking their eyes off him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>Mitya wrapped himself up in the quilt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) felt cold. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) bare feet stuck out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) couldn't pull the quilt over so as to cover them.
<p/>Nikolay Parfenovitch seemed to be gone a long time, <div class="bookquote">``an insufferable time.''  (<font color='red'><b>Nikolay Parfenovitch/Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov/Nikolay</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) thinks of me as a puppy,'' thought Mitya, gnashing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) teeth.
<p/>'' That rotten prosecutor has gone, too, contemptuous no doubt, it disgusts him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to see me naked!'' Mitya imagined, however, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) clothes would be examined and returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>But what was his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) indignation when Nikolay Parfenovitch came back with quite different clothes, brought in behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) by a peasant.
<p/>'' Here are clothes for you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) observed airily, seeming well satisfied with the success of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mission. '' Mr. Kalganov has kindly provided these for this unusual emergency, as well as a clean shirt.
<p/>Luckily he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalganov</b></font>) had them all in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalganov</b></font>) trunk. You can keep your own socks and underclothes. '' Mitya flew into a passion.
<p/>'' I won't have other people's clothes!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shouted menacingly, <div class="bookquote">``give me my own!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' It's impossible!'' <div class="bookquote">``Give me my own.
<p/>Damn Kalganov and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) clothes, too! ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>It was a long time before they could persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). But they succeeded somehow in quieting him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) down.
<p/>They impressed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) clothes, being stained with blood, must be <div class="bookquote">``included with the other material evidence,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and that they ``had not even the right to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) have them now ... taking into consideration the possible outcome of the case.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) merely observed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) put them on, that the clothes were much better than his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) old ones, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) disliked <div class="bookquote">``gaining by the change.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mitya at last understood this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) subsided into gloomy silence and hurriedly dressed himself. '' The coat was, besides, <div class="bookquote">``ridiculously tight.
<p/>They urged upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) again that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was exaggerating, that Kalganov was only a little taller, so that only the trousers might be a little too long.
<p/>Am I to be dressed up like a fool ... for your amusement?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But the coat turned out to be really tight in the shoulders.
<p/>Be so good as to tell Mr. Kalganov from me that I didn't ask for his (<font color='blue'><b>Kalganov</b></font>) clothes, and it's not my doing that they've dressed me up like a clown.''
<p/>'' Damn it all! I can hardly button it,'' Mitya grumbled. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) understands that, and is sorry ... I mean, not sorry to lend you his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) clothes, but sorry about all this business,'' mumbled Nikolay Parfenovitch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Confound his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sorrow! Well, where now? Am I to go on sitting here? ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was asked to go back to the <div class="bookquote">``other room.
<p/>Dressed in another man's clothes he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) felt himself disgraced, even in the eyes of the peasants, and of Trifon Borissovitch, whose face appeared, for some reason, in the doorway, and vanished immediately.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Mitya went in, scowling with anger, and trying to avoid looking at any one. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s come to look at me dressed up,'' thought Mitya.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sat down on the same chair as before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had an absurd nightmarish feeling, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) were out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mind.
<p/>'' Well, what now? Are you going to flog me? That's all that's left for you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said, clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) teeth and addressing the prosecutor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) looked too closely at my socks, and turned them inside out on purpose to show every one how dirty they were--the scoundrel!''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) would not turn to Nikolay Parfenovitch, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) disdained to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>). '' '' Well, now we must proceed to the examination of witnesses,'' observed Nikolay Parfenovitch, as though in reply to Mitya's question.
<p/>We've done what we could in your interest, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,'' Nikolay Parfenovitch went on, <div class="bookquote">``but having received from you such an uncompromising refusal to explain to us the source from which you obtained the money found upon you, we are, at the present moment--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Nikolay Parfenovitch/Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov/Nikolay</b></font>)</div>Yes,'' said the prosecutor thoughtfully, as though reflecting on something. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``What is the stone in your ring? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div><p/>Mitya interrupted suddenly, as though awakening from a reverie. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pointed to one of the three large rings adorning Nikolay Parfenovitch's right hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ring? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Nikolay Parfenovitch/Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov/Nikolay</b></font>)</div>repeated Nikolay Parfenovitch with surprise. '' Yes, that one ... on your middle finger, with the little veins in it, what stone is that?''
<p/>Mitya persisted, like a peevish child. '' That's a smoky topaz,'' said Nikolay Parfenovitch, smiling. '' Would you like to look at it?
<p/>I'll take it off ...'' '' No, don't take it off,'' cried Mitya furiously, suddenly waking up, and angry with himself.
<p/>Can you suppose that I would conceal it from you, if I had really killed my father, that I would shuffle, lie, and hide myself?
<p/>No, that's not like Dmitri Karamazov, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) couldn't do, and if I were guilty, I swear I shouldn't have waited for your coming, or for the sunrise as I meant at first, but should have killed myself before this, without waiting for the dawn!
<p/>'' Don't take it off ... there's no need.... Damn it!... Gentlemen, you've sullied my heart! I know that about myself now.
<p/>And should I have been like this on this night, and at this moment, sitting with you, could I have talked like this, could I have moved like this, could I have looked at you and at the world like this, if I had really been the murderer of my father, when the very thought of having accidentally killed Grigory gave me no peace all night--not from fear--
<p/>I couldn't have learnt so much in twenty years as I've found out in this accursed night!... oh, not simply from fear of your punishment!
<p/>And you expect me to be open with such scoffers as you, who see nothing and believe in nothing, blind moles and scoffers, and to tell you another nasty thing I've done, another disgrace, even if that would save me from your accusation!
<p/>The man who opened the door to my father and went in at that door, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) killed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>But I can tell you it was not Dmitri Karamazov, and that's all I can tell you, and that's enough, enough, leave me alone....
<p/>The disgrace of it! No, better Siberia! Who was he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>)? I'm racking my brains and can't think who. Exile me, punish me, but don't bother me any more.
<p/>I'll say no more. Call your witnesses!'' Mitya uttered his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sudden monologue as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) were determined to be absolutely silent for the future.
<p/>The prosecutor watched him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) the whole time and only when he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had ceased speaking, observed, as though it were the most ordinary thing, with the most frigid and composed air:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, about the open door of which you spoke just now, we may as well inform you, by the way, now, of a very interesting piece of evidence of the greatest importance both to you and to us, that has been given us by Grigory, the old man you wounded.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recovery, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clearly and emphatically stated, in reply to our questions, that when, on coming out to the steps, and hearing a noise in the garden, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind to go into it through the little gate which stood open, before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) noticed you running, as you have told us already, in the dark from the open window where you saw your father, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), Grigory, glanced to the left, and, while noticing the open window, observed at the same time, much nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), the door, standing wide open--that door which you have stated to have been shut the whole time you were in the garden.
<p/>I will not conceal from you that Grigory himself confidently affirms and bears witness that you must have run from that door, though, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) did not see you do so with his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) own eyes, since he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) only noticed you first some distance away in the garden, running towards the fence.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mitya had leapt up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) chair half-way through this speech. <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) yelled, in a sudden frenzy, <div class="bookquote">``it's a barefaced lie.

<p/>'' It's false, false! It's either an attempt to slander me, or the hallucination of a madman,'' Mitya still shouted. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s simply raving, from loss of blood, from the wound. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) must have fancied it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) came to.... He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s raving.''
<p/>Yes, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) noticed the open door, not when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) came to after his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) injuries, but before that, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went into the garden from the lodge.''
<p/>'' '' But it's false, it's false! It can't be so! He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s slandering me from spite.... He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) couldn't have seen it ...

<p/>It ... it must be that envelope of my father's, the envelope that contained the three thousand roubles ... and if there's inscribed on it, allow me, `For my little chicken' ...
<p/>The envelope was empty, and slit open at one end. Mitya stared at it with open eyes. '' yes--three thousand!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shouted, <div class="bookquote">``do you see, three thousand, do you see?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, we see. But we didn't find the money in it. It was empty, and lying on the floor by the bed, behind the screen.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya was completely breathless. '' But you told us yourself that the envelope was under your deceased father's pillow. You especially stated that it was under the pillow, so you must have known it.''

<p/>'' You mean, `steal it'? Speak out plainly now. Yes, I consider that I practically stole it, but, if you prefer, I `appropriated it.'
<p/>I consider I stole it. And last night I stole it finally.'' '' Last night? But you said that it's a month since you ... obtained it?...''
<p/>'' Yes. But not from my father. Not from my father, don't be uneasy. I didn't steal it from my father, but from her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>).
<p/>Let me tell you without interrupting. It's hard to do, you know. You see, a month ago, I was sent for by Katerina Ivanovna, formerly my betrothed.
<p/>Do you know her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)?'' '' Yes, of course. '' <div class="bookquote">``I know you know her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'s a noble creature, noblest of the noble.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Katerina Ivanovna!''  (<font color='red'><b>Nikolay Parfenovitch/Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov/Nikolay</b></font>)</div>Nikolay Parfenovitch exclaimed with wonder. The prosecutor, too, stared. '' Oh, don't take her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) name in vain! I'm a scoundrel to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) into it.
<p/>Yes, I've seen that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hated me ... a long while.... From the very first, even that evening at my lodging ... but enough, enough.
<p/>I need only tell you that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sent for me a month ago, gave me three thousand roubles to send off to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sister and another relation in Moscow -LRB-as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) couldn't have sent it off herself!-RRB-
<p/>... it was just at that fatal moment in my life when I ... well, in fact, when I'd just come to love another, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'s sitting down below now, Grushenka.
<p/>I carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) off here to Mokroe then, and wasted here in two days half that damned three thousand, but the other half I kept on me.
<p/>Well, I've kept that other half, that fifteen hundred, like a locket round my neck, but yesterday I undid it, and spent it.
<p/>You're unworthy even to know of that. No need of that at all.... and I What's left of it, eight hundred roubles, is in your hands now, Nikolay Parfenovitch.
<p/>That's the change out of the fifteen hundred I had yesterday.'' <div class="bookquote">``Excuse me. How's that? Why, when you were here a month ago you spent three thousand, not fifteen hundred, everybody knows that.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who knows it? Who counted the money? Did I let any one count it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, you told every one yourself that you'd spent exactly three thousand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' It's true, I did. I told the whole town so, and the whole town said so. And here, at Mokroe, too, every one reckoned it was three thousand.
<p/>Yet I didn't spend three thousand, but fifteen hundred. And the other fifteen hundred I sewed into a little bag. That's how it was, gentlemen.
<p/>That's where I got that money yesterday...'' '' This is almost miraculous,'' murmured Nikolay Parfenovitch. <div class="bookquote">``Allow me to inquire,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div>observed the prosecutor at last, <div class="bookquote">``have you informed any one whatever of this circumstance before,
<p/>I mean that you had fifteen hundred left about you a month ago?''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I told no one.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' That's strange. Do you mean absolutely no one?
<p/>'' '' Absolutely no one. No one and nobody. '' '' What was your reason for this reticence? What was your motive for making such a secret of it?
<p/>To be more precise: You have told us at last your secret, in your words, so `disgraceful,' though in reality--that is, of course, comparatively speaking--this action, that is, the appropriation of three thousand roubles belonging to some one else, and, of course, only for a time is, in my view at least, only an act of the greatest recklessness and not so disgraceful, when one takes into consideration your character....
<p/>Many people have already guessed, during this last month, about the three thousand of Katerina Ivanovna's, that you have spent, and I heard the legend myself, apart from your confession....
<p/>Mihail Makarovitch, for instance, had heard it, too, so that indeed, it was scarcely a legend, but the gossip of the whole town.
<p/>There are indications, too, if I am not mistaken, that you confessed this yourself to some one, I mean that the money was Katerina Ivanovna's, and so, it's extremely surprising to me that hitherto,
<p/>that is, up to the present moment, you have made such an extraordinary secret of the fifteen hundred you say you put by, apparently connecting a feeling of positive horror with that secret....
<p/>Even admitting that it was an action in the highest degree discreditable, still, discreditable is not `disgraceful.'... It's not easy to believe that it could cost you such distress to confess such a secret....
<p/>You cried out, just now, that Siberia would be better than confessing it ...'' The prosecutor ceased speaking. He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was provoked.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) did not conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) vexation, which was almost anger, and gave vent to all his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) accumulated spleen, disconnectedly and incoherently, without choosing words.
<p/>It's not the fifteen hundred that's the disgrace, but that I put it apart from the rest of the three thousand,'' said Mitya firmly.
<p/>What is there disgraceful, to your thinking, in your having set aside half of the three thousand you had discreditably, if you prefer, `disgracefully,' appropriated?
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Why? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div>smiled the prosecutor irritably. '' Your taking the three thousand is more important than what you did with it.
<p/>And by the way, why did you do that --why did you set apart that half, for what purpose, for what object did you do it?
<p/>I put it aside because I was vile, that is, because I was calculating, and to be calculating in such a case is vile ... and that vileness has been going on a whole month.
<p/>Can you explain that to us?'' '' Oh, gentlemen, the purpose is the whole point! '' cried Mitya. '' '' ''
<p/>It's incomprehensible.'' <div class="bookquote">``I wonder at you. But I'll make it clearer. Perhaps it really is incomprehensible. You see, attend to what I say.
<p/>I appropriate three thousand entrusted to my honor, I spend it on a spree, say I spend it all, and next morning I go to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) and say, `Katya, I've done wrong
<p/>, I've squandered your three thousand,' well, is that right? No, it's not right-- it's dishonest and cowardly , I'm a beast, with no more self-control than a beast, that's so, isn't it?
<p/>But still I'm not a thief? Not a downright thief, you'll admit! I squandered it, but I didn't steal it. Now a second, rather more favorable alternative: follow me carefully, or I may get confused again--
<p/>my head's going round--and so, for the second alternative: I spend here only fifteen hundred out of the three thousand, that is, only half.
<p/>Next day I go and take that half to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>): `Katya, take this fifteen hundred from me, I'm a low beast, and an untrustworthy scoundrel, for I've wasted half the money, and I shall waste this, too, so keep me from temptation!'
<p/>I should be a beast and a scoundrel, and whatever you like; but not a thief, not altogether a thief, or I should not have brought back what was left, but have kept that, too.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) would see at once that since I brought back half, I should pay back what I'd spent, that I should never give up trying to, that I should work to get it and pay it back.
<p/>So in that case I should be a scoundrel, but not a thief, you may say what you like, not a thief!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, what of that alternative? <div class="bookquote">``I admit that there is a certain distinction,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div>said the prosecutor, with a cold smile. ''
<p/>Every man may be a scoundrel, and perhaps every man is a scoundrel, but not every one can be a thief, it takes an arch-scoundrel to be that.
<p/>Oh, of course, I don't know how to make these fine distinctions ... but a thief is lower than a scoundrel, that's my conviction.
<p/>Listen, I carry the money about me a whole month, I may make up my mind to give it back to-morrow, and I'm a scoundrel no longer, but I cannot make up my mind, you see, though I'm making up my mind every day, and every day spurring myself on to do it, and yet for a whole month I can't bring myself to it, you see.
<p/>But it's strange that you see such a vital difference. '' '' Yes, I see a vital difference! Is that right to your thinking, is that right?''
<p/>And let us give up all discussion of these subtleties and distinctions, and, if you will be so kind, get back to the point.
<p/>And the point is, that you have still not told us, altogether we've asked you, why, in the first place, you halved the money, squandering one half and hiding the other?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, that's not right, that I can quite understand, and that I don't dispute,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div>answered the prosecutor with reserve. '' For what purpose exactly did you hide it
<p/>, what did you mean to do with that fifteen hundred? I insist upon that question, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.'' '' Yes, of course!
<p/>'' cried Mitya, striking himself on the forehead; <div class="bookquote">``forgive me, I'm worrying you, and am not explaining the chief point, or you'd understand in a minute, for it's just the motive of it
<p/>that's the disgrace! You see, it was all to do with the old man, my dead father. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was always pestering Agrafena Alexandrovna, and I was jealous
<p/>So I kept thinking every day, suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) were to make up her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mind all of a sudden, suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) were to leave off tormenting me, and were suddenly to say to me, 'I love you, not him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); take me to the other end of the world.'
<p/>; I thought then that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was hesitating between me and him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). And I'd only forty copecks; how could I take her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) away, what could I do?
<p/>Why, I'd be lost. You see, I didn't know her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) then, I didn't understand her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wanted money, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wouldn't forgive my poverty.
<p/>And so I fiendishly counted out the half of that three thousand, sewed it up, calculating on it, sewed it up before I was drunk, and after I had sewn it up, I went off to get drunk on the rest.
<p/>I should have called it sensible and moral on your part not to have squandered it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>chuckled Nikolay Parfenovitch, <div class="bookquote">``for after all what does it amount to?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nikolay Parfenovitch/Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov/Nikolay</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes, that was base. Do you understand now?'' Both the lawyers laughed aloud. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why, that I stole it, that's what it amounts to!
<p/>Oh, God, you horrify me by not understanding! Every day that I had that fifteen hundred sewn up round my neck,
<p/>every day and every hour I said to myself, `You're a thief! you're a thief!' Yes, that's why I've been so savage all this month
<p/>, that's why I fought in the tavern, that's why I attacked my father, it was because I felt I was a thief.
<p/>I couldn't make up my mind, I didn't dare even to tell Alyosha, my brother, about that fifteen hundred: I felt I was such a scoundrel and such a pickpocket.
<p/>But, do you know, while I carried it I said to myself at the same time every hour: `No, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, you may yet not be a thief.'
<p/>And only yesterday I made up my mind to tear my amulet off my neck, on my way from Fenya's to Perhotin.
<p/>Why? Because I might go next day and pay back that fifteen hundred to Katya. I hadn't been able till that moment to bring myself to it.
<p/>And it was only when I tore it off that I became a downright thief, a thief and a dishonest man for the rest of my life.
<p/>Because, with that I destroyed, too, my dream of going to Katya and saying, `I'm a scoundrel, but not a thief!'
<p/>Why? Do you understand now? Do you understand?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What was it made you decide to do it yesterday? '' Nikolay Parfenovitch interrupted.
<p/>'' Why? It's absurd to ask. Because I had condemned myself to die at five o'clock this morning, here, at dawn.
<p/>I thought it made no difference whether I died a thief or a man of honor. But I see it's not so
<p/>what has tortured me most during this night has not been the thought that I'd killed the old servant, and that I was in danger of Siberia just when my love was being rewarded, and Heaven was open to me again.
<p/>Oh, that did torture me, but not in the same way: not so much as the damned consciousness that I had torn that damned money off my breast at last and spent it, and had become a downright thief!
<p/>, it turns out that it does make a difference. Believe me, gentlemen, Oh, gentlemen, I tell you again, with a bleeding heart, I have learnt a great deal this night.
<p/>I have learnt that it's not only impossible to live a scoundrel, but impossible to die a scoundrel.... No, gentlemen, one must die honest...
<p/>'' Mitya was pale. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face had a haggard and exhausted look, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) being intensely excited. '' I am beginning to understand you, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,'' the prosecutor said slowly, in a soft and almost compassionate tone.
<p/>'' But all this, if you'll excuse my saying so, is a matter of nerves, in my opinion ... your overwrought nerves, that's what it is.
<p/>And why, for instance, should you not have saved yourself such misery for almost a month, by going and returning that fifteen hundred to the lady who had entrusted it to you?
<p/>And why could you not have explained things to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and in view of your position, which you describe as being so awful, why could you not have had recourse to the plan which would so naturally have occurred to one's mind, that is, after honorably confessing your errors to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), why could you not have asked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to lend you the sum needed for your expenses, which, with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) generous heart, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would certainly not have refused you in your distress, especially if it had been with some guarantee, or even on the security you offered to the merchant Samsonov, and to Madame Hohlakov?
<p/>I suppose you still regard that security as of value? '' Mitya suddenly crimsoned. '' Surely you don't think me such an out and out scoundrel as that?
<p/>You can't be speaking in earnest? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) said, with indignation, looking the prosecutor straight in the face, and seeming unable to believe his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) ears.
<p/>'' I assure you I'm in earnest.... Why do you imagine I'm not serious? '' It was the prosecutor's turn to be surprised.
<p/>'' Oh, how base that would have been! Gentlemen, do you know, you are torturing me! Let me tell you everything, so be it.
<p/>I'll confess all my infernal wickedness, but to put you to shame, and you'll be surprised yourselves at the depth of ignominy to which a medley of human passions can sink.
<p/>Yes, gentlemen, I, too, have had that thought in my mind all this current month, so that I was on the point of deciding to go to Katya--I was mean enough for that.
<p/>But to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>), to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) of my treachery, and for that very treachery, to carry it out, for the expenses of that treachery, to beg for money from her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>), Katya -LRB-to beg, do you hear, to beg-RRB-, and go straight from her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) to run away with the other, the rival, who hated and insulted her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>)--to think of it!
<p/>You must know that I already had that plan myself , that plan you spoke of, just now, prosecutor! You must be mad, prosecutor!''
<p/>I am not, but I did speak in haste, without thinking ... of that feminine jealousy ... if there could be jealousy in this case, as you assert ...
<p/>'' Mad yes, perhaps there is something of the kind,'' said the prosecutor, smiling. '' But that would have been so infamous!''
<p/>Mitya brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) fist down on the table fiercely. '' That would have been filthy beyond everything! Yes, do you know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mad</b></font>) might have given me that money, yes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mad</b></font>) would have given it, too
<p/>; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mad</b></font>)'d have been certain to give it, to be revenged on me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mad</b></font>)'d have given it to satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Mad</b></font>) vengeance, to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Mad</b></font>) contempt for me, for hers is an infernal nature, too, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mad</b></font>)'s a woman of great wrath.
<p/>I'd have taken the money, too, oh, I should have taken it; I should have taken it, and then, for the rest of my life ...
<p/>Forgive me, gentlemen, I'm making such an outcry because I've had that thought in my mind so lately, only the day before yesterday, that night when I was having all that bother with Lyagavy, and afterwards yesterday, all day yesterday, I remember, till that happened ...''
<p/>oh, God! '' Till what happened?'' put in Nikolay Parfenovitch inquisitively, but Mitya did not hear it. '' I have made you an awful confession,'' Mitya said gloomily in conclusion.
<p/>You must appreciate it, and what's more, you must respect it, for if not, if that leaves your souls untouched, then you've simply no respect for me, gentlemen, I tell you that, and I shall die of shame at having confessed it to men like you!
<p/>'' Oh, I shall shoot myself! Yes, I see, I see already that you don't believe me. What, you want to write that down, too?
<p/>Yes, what you said just now,'' said Nikolay Parfenovitch, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) in surprise, <div class="bookquote">``that is, that up to the last hour you were still contemplating going to Katerina Ivanovna to beg that sum from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)....
<p/>I assure you, that's a very important piece of evidence for us, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I mean for the whole case ... and particularly for you, particularly important for you.''

(<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya flung up his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands. '' Don't write that, anyway; have some shame.
<p/>Here I've torn my heart asunder before you, and you seize the opportunity and are fingering the wounds in both halves....
<p/>Don't worry yourself so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,'' observed the prosecutor, <div class="bookquote">``everything that is written down will be read over to you afterwards, and what you don't agree to we'll alter as you like.
<p/>Oh, my God!''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor everything</b></font>)</div>In despair he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hid his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands. '' But now I'll ask you one little question for the second time.
<p/>Has no one, absolutely no one, heard from you of that money you sewed up? That, I must tell you, is almost impossible to believe.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, this matter is bound to be explained, and there's plenty of time for it, but meantime, consider; we have perhaps a dozen witnesses that you yourself spread it abroad, and even shouted almost everywhere about the three thousand you'd spent here;

<p/>And now, too, when you got hold of the money you had yesterday, you gave many people to understand that you had brought three thousand with you.
<p/>You've got not dozens, but hundreds of witnesses, two hundred witnesses, two hundred have heard it, thousands have heard it!'' cried Mitya.
<p/>'' '' '' Well, you see, all bear witness to it. And the word all means something.'' <div class="bookquote">``It means nothing. I talked rot, and every one began repeating it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But what need had you to `talk rot,' as you call it?'' '' The devil knows. From bravado perhaps ... at having wasted so much money....
<p/>To try and forget that money I had sewn up, perhaps ... yes, that was why ... damn it ... how often will you ask me that question?
<p/>Well, I told a fib, and that was the end of it, once I'd said it, I didn't care to correct it.
<p/>What does a man tell lies for sometimes?'' '' That's very difficult to decide, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, what makes a man tell lies,'' observed the prosecutor impressively.

<p/>I took it without asking, because it was a worthless rag. I tore it up, and I took the notes and sewed them up in it.
<p/>I believe it was in that very rag I sewed them. An old piece of calico, washed a thousand times.'' ''
<p/>And you remember that for certain now?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't know whether for certain. I think it was in the cap. But, hang it, what does it matter?''

(<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' No, she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) won't, she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) didn't miss it.

<p/>'' And where did you get the needle and thread?'' <div class="bookquote">``I'll stop now. I won't say any more. Enough of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>said Mitya, losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) temper at last.
<p/>'' It's strange that you should have so completely forgotten where you threw the pieces in the market-place.'' <div class="bookquote">``Give orders for the market-place to be swept to-morrow, and perhaps you'll find it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>said Mitya, sneering.
<p/>'' Enough, gentlemen, enough! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) decided, in an exhausted voice. '' I see you don't believe me! Not for a moment!
<p/>It's my fault, not yours. I ought not to have been so ready. Why, why did I degrade myself by confessing my secret to you?
<p/>It's a joke to you. I see that from your eyes. You led me on to it, prosecutor? Sing a hymn of triumph if you can....
<p/>Damn you, you torturers!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) head, and hid his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) hands. The lawyers were silent. A minute later he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) head and looked at them almost vacantly.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) face now expressed complete, hopeless despair, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) sat mute and passive as though hardly conscious of what was happening.
<p/>In the meantime they had to finish what they were about. They had immediately to begin examining the witnesses. It was by now eight o'clock in the morning.
<p/>The lights had been extinguished long ago. Mihail Makarovitch and Kalganov, who had been continually in and out of the room
<p/>all the while the interrogation had been going on, had now both gone out again. The lawyers, too, looked very tired.
<p/>It was a wretched morning, the whole sky was overcast, and the rain streamed down in bucketfuls. Mitya gazed blankly out of the window.
<p/>'' May I look out of the window? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) asked Nikolay Parfenovitch, suddenly. '' Oh, as much as you like,'' the latter replied.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) could see the muddy road just below the house, and farther away, in the rain and mist, a row of poor, black, dismal huts, looking even blacker and poorer in the rain.
<p/>Mitya got up and went to the window.... The rain lashed against its little greenish panes. Mitya thought of <div class="bookquote">``Phoebus the golden-haired,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had meant to shoot himself at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) first ray.
<p/>Perhaps it would be even better on a morning like this,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) thought with a smile, and suddenly, flinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hand downwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``torturers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I see that I am lost!

<p/>They decided that if tea were ready downstairs -LRB-Mihail Makarovitch had, no doubt, gone down to get some-RRB- they would have a glass and then <div class="bookquote">``go on and on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mihail Makarovitch/Mihail</b></font>)</div>putting off their proper breakfast until a more favorable opportunity.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Shouldn't we have some tea first?

(<font color='red'><b>Nikolay Parfenovitch/Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov/Nikolay</b></font>)</div>Tea really was ready below, and was soon brought up.
<p/>Mitya at first refused the glass that Nikolay Parfenovitch politely offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), but afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) asked for it himself and drank it greedily.
<p/>It might have been supposed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) Herculean strength that one night of carousing, even accompanied by the most violent emotions, could have had little effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) could hardly hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head up, and from time to time all the objects about him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seemed heaving and dancing before his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) looked surprisingly exhausted. '' A little more and I shall begin raving,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said to himself. Chapter VIII. The Evidence Of The Witnesses.
<p/>And so we will not dwell on how Nikolay Parfenovitch impressed on every witness called that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) must give his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) evidence in accordance with truth and conscience, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) would afterwards have to repeat his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) evidence on oath, how every witness was called upon to sign the protocol of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) evidence, and so on.
<p/>We will only note that the point principally insisted upon in the examination was the question of the three thousand roubles, that is, was the sum spent here, at Mokroe, by Mitya on the first occasion, a month before, three thousand or fifteen hundred?
<p/>The Babe The examination of the witnesses began. But we will not continue our story in such detail as before. And again had he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) spent three thousand or fifteen hundred yesterday?
<p/>There was not one in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) favor, and some witnesses introduced new, almost crushing facts, in contradiction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), Mitya's, story.
<p/>Alas, all the evidence given by every one turned out to be against Mitya. The first witness examined was Trifon Borissovitch.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had, on the contrary, an air of stern and severe indignation with the accused, which gave him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) an appearance of truthfulness and personal dignity.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was not in the least abashed as he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) stood before the lawyers. He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) spoke little, and with reserve, waited to be questioned, answered precisely and deliberately.
<p/>Firmly and unhesitatingly he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) bore witness that the sum spent a month before could not have been less than three thousand, that all the peasants about here would testify that they had heard the sum of three thousand mentioned by Dmitri Fyodorovitch himself.
<p/>'' What a lot of money he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) flung away on the gypsy girls alone! He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) wasted a thousand, I daresay, on them alone.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe I gave them five hundred,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>was Mitya's gloomy comment on this. '' It's a pity I didn't count the money at the time, but I was drunk...
<p/>'' Mitya was sitting sideways with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) back to the curtains. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) listened gloomily, with a melancholy and exhausted air, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would say: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, say what you like.
<p/>It makes no difference now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``More than a thousand went on them, Dmitri Fyodorovitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Trifon Borissovitch/Trifon</b></font>)</div>retorted Trifon Borissovitch firmly. '' You flung it about at random and they picked it up.
<p/>They were a rascally, thievish lot, horse-stealers, they've been driven away from here, or maybe they'd bear witness themselves how much they got from you.
<p/>I didn't, you didn't let me, that's true enough--but by the look of it I should say it was far more than fifteen hundred ...
<p/>I saw the sum in your hands, myself--count it fifteen hundred, indeed! We've seen money too. We can judge of amounts....
<p/>As for the sum spent yesterday he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) asserted that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) arrived, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had brought three thousand with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>).
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Come now, is that so, Trifon Borissovitch? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>replied Mitya. '' Surely I didn't declare so positively that I'd brought three thousand?''
<p/>And in the hall, when you were treating the chorus, you shouted straight out that you would leave your sixth thousand here
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You did say so, Dmitri Fyodorovitch. You said it before Andrey. Andrey himself is still here. Send for him (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>). --that is with what you spent before, we must understand.
<p/>Stepan and Semyon heard it, and Pyotr Fomitch Kalganov, too, was standing beside you at the time. Maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>)'d remember it....
<p/>They were delighted with this new mode of reckoning; three and three made six, three thousand then and three now made six, that was clear.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The evidence as to the <div class="bookquote">``sixth''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyers</b></font>)</div>thousand made an extraordinary impression on the two lawyers. They questioned all the peasants suggested by Trifon Borissovitch, Stepan and Semyon, the driver Andrey, and Kalganov.
<p/>They noted down, with particular care, Andrey's account of the conversation he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>) had had with Mitya on the road: '' `Where,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrey</b></font>), `am I, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, going, to heaven or to hell, and shall I be forgiven in the next world or not?'
<p/>The psychological Ippolit Kirillovitch heard this with a subtle smile, and ended by recommending that these remarks as to where Dmitri Fyodorovitch would go should be <div class="bookquote">``included in the case.
<p/>Kalganov, when called, came in reluctantly, frowning and ill-humored, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) spoke to the lawyers as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had never met them before in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) life, though they were acquaintances whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had been meeting every day for a long time past.
<p/>The peasants and the driver unhesitatingly confirmed Trifon Borissovitch's evidence. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dmitri/Dmitri Fyodorovitch/Dmitri Karamazov</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) began by saying that ``he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) knew nothing about it and didn't want to.
<p/>But it appeared that he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) had heard of the <div class="bookquote">``sixth''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thousand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) admitted that he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) had been standing close by at the moment.
<p/>'' As far as he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) could see he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``didn't know''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>how much money Mitya had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) affirmed that the Poles had cheated at cards.
<p/>In reply to reiterated questions he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) stated that, after the Poles had been turned out, Mitya's position with Agrafena Alexandrovna had certainly improved, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) had said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) spoke of Agrafena Alexandrovna with reserve and respect, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) had been a lady of the best society, and did not once allow himself to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Alexandrovna</b></font>) Grushenka.
<p/>In spite of the young man's obvious repugnance at giving evidence, Ippolit Kirillovitch examined him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at great length, and only from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) learnt all the details of what made up Mitya's <div class="bookquote">``romance,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>so to say, on that night.
<p/>Mitya did not once pull Kalganov up. At last they let the young man go, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left the room with unconcealed indignation.
<p/>Though they had gone to bed in their room, they had not slept all night, and on the arrival of the police officers they hastily dressed and got ready, realizing that they would certainly be sent for.
<p/>The little Pole turned out to be a retired official of the twelfth class, who had served in Siberia as a veterinary surgeon.
<p/>The Poles, too, were examined. They gave their evidence with dignity, though not without some uneasiness. His (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) name was Mussyalovitch. Pan Vrublevsky turned out to be an uncertificated dentist.
<p/>Although Nikolay Parfenovitch asked them questions on entering the room they both addressed their answers to Mihail Makarovitch, who was standing on one side, taking him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) in their ignorance for the most important person and in command, and addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) at every word as ``Pan Colonel.
<p/>Only after several reproofs from Mihail Makarovitch himself, they grasped that they had to address their answers to Nikolay Parfenovitch only.
<p/>Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) relations with Grushenka, past and present, Pan Mussyalovitch spoke proudly and warmly, so that Mitya was roused at once and declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would not allow the <div class="bookquote">``scoundrel''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to speak like that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) presence!
<p/>Pan Mussyalovitch at once called attention to the word <div class="bookquote">``scoundrel''  (<font color='red'><b>Pan Mussyalovitch/Mussyalovitch</b></font>)</div>and begged that it should be put down in the protocol.
<p/>'' It turned out that they could speak Russian quite correctly except for their accent in some words. Mitya fumed with rage.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s a scoundrel! A scoundrel! You can put that down. And put down, too, that, in spite of the protocol I still declare that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s a scoundrel!
<p/>After sternly reprimanding Mitya, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cut short all further inquiry into the romantic aspect of the case, and hastened to pass to what was essential.
<p/>One piece of evidence given by the Poles roused special interest in the lawyers: that was how, in that very room, Mitya had tried to buy off Pan Mussyalovitch, and had offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) three thousand roubles to resign his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) claims, seven hundred roubles down, and the remaining two thousand three hundred <div class="bookquote">``to be paid next day in the town.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cried. Though Nikolay Parfenovitch did insert this in the protocol, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) showed the most praiseworthy tact and management. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had sworn at the time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had not the whole sum with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) at Mokroe, but that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) money was in the town.
<p/>Mitya observed hotly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had not said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would be sure to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) the remainder next day in the town.
<p/>But Pan Vrublevsky confirmed the statement, and Mitya, after thinking for a moment admitted, frowning, that it must have been as the Poles stated, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had been excited at the time, and might indeed have said so.
<p/>It seemed to establish for the prosecution -LRB-and they did, in fact, base this deduction on it-RRB- that half, or a part of, the three thousand that had come into Mitya's hands might really have been left somewhere hidden in the town, or even, perhaps, somewhere here, in Mokroe.
<p/>This would explain the circumstance, so baffling for the prosecution, that only eight hundred roubles were to be found in Mitya's hands.
<p/>This circumstance had been the one piece of evidence which, insignificant as it was, had hitherto told, to some extent, in Mitya's favor.
<p/>The prosecutor positively pounced on this piece of evidence. Now this one piece of evidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) favor had broken down.
<p/>In answer to the prosecutor's inquiry, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would have got the remaining two thousand three hundred roubles, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) himself had denied having more than fifteen hundred, Mitya confidently replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had meant to offer the <div class="bookquote">``little chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>not money, but a formal deed of conveyance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) rights to the village of Tchermashnya, those rights which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had already offered to Samsonov and Madame Hohlakov.
<p/>And you imagine he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would have accepted such a deed as a substitute for two thousand three hundred roubles in cash?''
<p/>The prosecutor positively smiled at the <div class="bookquote">``innocence of this subterfuge.''  (<font color='red'><b>The prosecutor</b></font>)</div>'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) certainly would have accepted it,'' Mitya declared warmly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would have put his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) lawyers, Poles and Jews, on to the job, and might have got, not three thousand, but the whole property out of the old man.
<p/>'' Why, look here, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have grabbed not two thousand, but four or six, for it. '' The evidence of Pan Mussyalovitch was, of course, entered in the protocol in the fullest detail.
<p/>Nikolay Parfenovitch was too well pleased with them, as it was, and did not want to worry them with trifles, moreover, it was nothing but a foolish, drunken quarrel over cards.
<p/>Then they let the Poles go. The incident of the cheating at cards was hardly touched upon. There had been drinking and disorder enough, that night....
<p/>So the two hundred roubles remained in the pockets of the Poles. Then old Maximov was summoned. He (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) came in timidly, approached with little steps, looking very disheveled and depressed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) had, all this time, taken refuge below with Grushenka, sitting dumbly beside her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), and <div class="bookquote">``now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>)'d begin blubbering over her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) and wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) eyes with a blue check handkerchief,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>as Mihail Makarovitch described afterwards.
<p/>The old man at once confessed that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done wrong, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had borrowed <div class="bookquote">``ten roubles in my poverty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>from Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was ready to pay it back.
<p/>To Nikolay Parfenovitch's direct question, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) noticed how much money Dmitri Fyodorovitch held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) hand, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) must have been able to see the sum better than any one when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) took the note from him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), Maximov, in the most positive manner, declared that there was twenty thousand.
<p/>So that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) herself began trying to pacify and comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>). '' Have you ever seen so much as twenty thousand before, then?
<p/>'' inquired Nikolay Parfenovitch, with a smile. '' To be sure I have, not twenty, but seven, when my wife mortgaged my little property.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'d only let me look at it from a distance, boasting of it to me. It was a very thick bundle, all rainbow-colored notes.
<p/>Nikolay Parfenovitch was obviously apprehensive of the effect her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) appearance might have on Mitya, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) muttered a few words of admonition to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), but Mitya bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head in silence, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to understand <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would not make a scene.
<p/>And Dmitri Fyodorovitch's were all rainbow-colored... ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was not kept long. At last it was Grushenka's turn. '' Mihail Makarovitch himself led Grushenka in.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) entered with a stern and gloomy face, that looked almost composed and sat down quietly on the chair offered her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) by Nikolay Parfenovitch.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was very pale, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) seemed to be cold, and wrapped herself closely in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) magnificent black shawl. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was suffering from a slight feverish chill--the first symptom of the long illness which followed that night.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) grave air, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) direct earnest look and quiet manner made a very favorable impression on every one. Nikolay Parfenovitch was even a little bit ``fascinated.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) admitted himself, when talking about it afterwards, that only then had he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) seen <div class="bookquote">``how handsome the woman was,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>for, though he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) several times before, he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had always looked upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as something of a <div class="bookquote">``provincial hetaira.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But this was received with positive indignation by the ladies, who immediately called him (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a <div class="bookquote">``naughty man,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>to his (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) great satisfaction.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has the manners of the best society,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said enthusiastically, gossiping about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in a circle of ladies. As she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) entered the room, Grushenka only glanced for an instant at Mitya, who looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) uneasily.
<p/>After the first inevitable inquiries and warnings, Nikolay Parfenovitch asked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), hesitating a little, but preserving the most courteous manner, on what terms she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was with the retired lieutenant, Dmitri Fyodorovitch Karamazov.
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face reassured him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) at once. To this Grushenka firmly and quietly replied: ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) was an acquaintance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) came to see me as an acquaintance during the last month.
<p/>To further inquisitive questions she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered plainly and with complete frankness, that, though <div class="bookquote">``at times''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) attractive, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>), but had won his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) heart as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) old father's <div class="bookquote">``in my nasty spite,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had seen that Mitya was very jealous of Fyodor Pavlovitch and every one else; but that had only amused her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had never meant to go to Fyodor Pavlovitch, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had simply been laughing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>). '' I had no thoughts for either of them all this last month.
<p/>But I think,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said in conclusion, ``that there's no need for you to inquire about that, nor for me to answer you, for that's my own affair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) again dismissed the <div class="bookquote">``romantic''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>aspect of the case and passed to the serious one, that is, to the question of most importance, concerning the three thousand roubles.
<p/>Grushenka confirmed the statement that three thousand roubles had certainly been spent on the first carousal at Mokroe, and, though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had not counted the money herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had heard that it was three thousand from Dmitri Fyodorovitch's own lips.
<p/>Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) tell you that alone, or before some one else, or did you only hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) speak of it to others in your presence?
<p/>I was expecting another man who had wronged me. '' Nikolay Parfenovitch immediately acted upon this hint. '' '' the prosecutor inquired immediately.
<p/>To which Grushenka replied that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) say so before other people, and had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) say so when they were alone.
<p/>'' Did he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) say it to you alone once, or several times? '' inquired the prosecutor, and learned that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had told Grushenka so several times.
<p/>Further examination elicited that Grushenka knew, too, where that money had come from, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had got it from Katerina Ivanovna.
<p/>And did you never, once, hear that the money spent a month ago was not three thousand, but less, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch had saved half that sum for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) own use?''
<p/>Ippolit Kirillovitch was very well satisfied with this piece of evidence. '' '' No, I never heard that,'' answered Grushenka. It was explained further that Mitya had, on the contrary, often told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hadn't a farthing.
<p/>Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) never say before you ... casually, or in a moment of irritation,'' Nikolay Parfenovitch put in suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) intended to make an attempt on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father's life?''

'' <div class="bookquote">``Ach, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) did say so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>sighed Grushenka.
<p/>'' Once or several times? '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mentioned it several times, always in anger.'' '' And did you believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would do it?''
<p/>'' No, I never believed it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) answered firmly. '' I had faith in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) noble heart.'' <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen, allow me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>cried Mitya suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``allow me to say one word to Agrafena Alexandrovna, in your presence.

(<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) chair, <div class="bookquote">``have faith in God and in me.
<p/>I am not guilty of my father's murder!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Having uttered these words Mitya sat down again on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) chair. Grushenka stood up and crossed herself devoutly before the ikon. ''
<p/>Thanks be to Thee, O Lord,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said, in a voice thrilled with emotion, and still standing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) turned to Nikolay Parfenovitch and added: <div class="bookquote">``As he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) has spoken now, believe it!
<p/>I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'ll say anything as a joke or from obstinacy, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'ll never deceive you against his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) conscience. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s telling the whole truth, you may believe it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Nikolay Parfenovitch/Nikolay Parfenovitch Nelyudov/Nikolay</b></font>)</div><p/>As to the money spent the previous day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) did not know what sum it was, but had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) tell several people that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had three thousand with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>).
<p/>And to the question where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) got the money, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``stolen''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>it from Katerina Ivanovna, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had replied to that that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) hadn't stolen it, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) must pay the money back next day.
<p/>On the prosecutor's asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) emphatically whether the money he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had stolen from Katerina Ivanovna was what he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had spent yesterday, or what he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had squandered here a month ago, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) meant the money spent a month ago, and that that was how she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) understood him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>).
<p/>Grushenka was at last released, and Nikolay Parfenovitch informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) impulsively that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) might at once return to the town and
<p/>that if he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) could be of any assistance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), with horses for example, or if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would care for an escort, he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) ... would be--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank you sincerely,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Grushenka, bowing to him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I'm going with this old gentleman, I am driving him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back to town with me, and meanwhile, if you'll allow me, I'll wait below to hear what you decide about Dmitri Fyodorovitch.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Thanks, Agrafena Alexandrovna, you've given me fresh courage,'' Mitya responded in a quivering voice. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) went out. Mitya was calm, and even looked more cheerful, but only for a moment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) felt more and more oppressed by a strange physical weakness. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) eyes were closing with fatigue. The examination of the witnesses was, at last, over.
<p/>Mitya got up, moved from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) chair to the corner by the curtain, lay down on a large chest covered with a rug, and instantly fell asleep.
<p/>They proceeded to a final revision of the protocol. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had a strange dream, utterly out of keeping with the place and the time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was driving somewhere in the steppes, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had been stationed long ago, and a peasant was driving him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) in a cart with a pair of horses, through snow and sleet.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was cold, it was early in November, and the snow was falling in big wet flakes, melting as soon as it touched the earth.
<p/>And the peasant drove him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) smartly, he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) had a fair, long beard. He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was not an old man, somewhere about fifty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) had on a gray peasant's smock.
<p/>Not far off was a village, he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) could see the black huts, and half the huts were burnt down, there were only the charred beams sticking up.
<p/>And as they drove in, there were peasant women drawn up along the road, a lot of women, a whole row, all thin and wan, with their faces a sort of brownish color, especially one at the edge, a tall, bony woman, who looked forty, but might have been only twenty, with a long thin face.
<p/>And in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms was a little baby crying. And her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breasts seemed so dried up that there was not a drop of milk in them.
<p/>And the child cried and cried, and held out its little bare arms, with its little fists blue from cold. ''
<p/>Why are they crying? Why are they crying? '' Mitya asked, as they dashed gayly by. '' It's the babe,'' answered the driver, ``the babe weeping.
<p/>And Mitya was struck by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) saying, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) peasant way, <div class="bookquote">``the babe,''  (<font color='red'><b>peasant</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) liked the peasant's calling it a <div class="bookquote">``babe.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the peasant</b></font>)</div>'' There seemed more pity in it. '' But why is it weeping? '' Mitya persisted stupidly, <div class="bookquote">``why are its little arms bare?
<p/>Why don't they wrap it up?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>'' The babe's cold, its little clothes are frozen and don't warm it.'' '' But why is it?
<p/>Why? '' foolish Mitya still persisted. '' Why, they're poor people, burnt out. They've no bread. They're begging because they've been burnt out.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya, as it were, still did not understand. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me why it is those poor mothers stand there? Why are people poor?
<p/>Why is the babe poor? Why is the steppe barren? Why don't they hug each other and kiss? Why don't they sing songs of joy?
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) felt that, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) questions were unreasonable and senseless, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wanted to ask just that, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had to ask it just in that way.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) felt that a passion of pity, such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had never known before, was rising in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heart, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wanted to cry, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wanted to do something for them all, so that the babe should weep no more, so that the dark- faced, dried-up mother should not weep, that no one should shed tears again from that moment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wanted to do it at once, at once, regardless of all obstacles, with all the recklessness of the Karamazovs.
<p/>Why are they so dark from black misery? Why don't they feed the babe? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' And I'm coming with you.
<p/>I won't leave you now for the rest of my life, I'm coming with you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heard close beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) Grushenka's tender voice, thrilling with emotion.
<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heart glowed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) struggled forward towards the light, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) longed to live, to live, to go on and on, towards the new, beckoning light, and to hasten, hasten, now, at once!
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) exclaimed opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) eyes, and sitting up on the chest, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had revived from a swoon, smiling brightly.
<p/>'' What! Where? '' Nikolay Parfenovitch was standing over him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), suggesting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) should hear the protocol read aloud and sign it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was suddenly struck by the fact that there was a pillow under his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head, which hadn't been there when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had leant back, exhausted, on the chest.
<p/>Mitya guessed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had been asleep an hour or more, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) did not hear Nikolay Parfenovitch. '' Who put that pillow under my head?
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cried, with a sort of ecstatic gratitude, and tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) voice, as though some great kindness had been shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) never found out who this kind man was; perhaps one of the peasant witnesses, or Nikolay Parfenovitch's little secretary, had compassionately thought to put a pillow under his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) head; but his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) whole soul was quivering with tears.
<p/>I've had a good dream, gentlemen,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) said in a strange voice, with a new light, as of joy, in his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) face.
<p/>Who was so kind? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) went to the table and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) would sign whatever they liked. '' Chapter IX.
<p/>When the protocol had been signed, Nikolay Parfenovitch turned solemnly to the prisoner and read him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) the <div class="bookquote">``Committal,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>setting forth, that in such a year, on such a day, in such a place, the investigating lawyer of such-
<p/>and-such a district court, having examined so-and-so -LRB-to wit, Mitya-RRB- accused of this and of that -LRB-all the charges were carefully written out-RRB- and having considered that the accused, not pleading guilty to the charges made against him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), had brought forward nothing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) defense, while the witnesses, so-and-so, and so-and-so, and the circumstances such-and-such testify against him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), acting in accordance with such-and-such articles of the Statute Book, and so on, has ruled, that, in order to preclude so-and-
<p/>so -LRB-Mitya-RRB- from all means of evading pursuit and judgment he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) be detained in such-and-such a prison, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hereby notifies to the accused and communicates a copy of this same <div class="bookquote">``Committal''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to the deputy prosecutor, and so on, and so on.
<p/>In brief, Mitya was informed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was, from that moment, a prisoner, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would be driven at once to the town, and there shut up in a very unpleasant place.
<p/>They Carry Mitya Away Mitya listened attentively, and only shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shoulders. '' Well, gentlemen, I don't blame you. I'm ready....
<p/>Nikolay Parfenovitch informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) gently that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would be escorted at once by the rural police officer, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, who happened to be on the spot...
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mavriky Mavrikyevitch</b></font>)</div>Mitya interrupted, suddenly, and impelled by uncontrollable feeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pronounced, addressing all in the room: <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen, we're all cruel, we're all monsters, we all make men weep, and mothers, and babes at the breast, but of all, let it be settled here, now, of all I am the lowest reptile!
<p/>I understand that there's nothing else for you to do. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I've sworn to amend, and every day I've done the same filthy things.
<p/>I understand now that such men as I need a blow, a blow of destiny to catch them as with a noose, and bind them by a force from without.
<p/>I accept the torture of accusation, and my public shame, I want to suffer and by suffering I shall be purified.
<p/>Never, never should I have risen of myself! But the thunderbolt has fallen. Perhaps I shall be purified, gentlemen? But listen, for the last time, I am not guilty of my father's blood.
<p/>I accept my punishment, not because I killed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), but because I meant to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and perhaps I really might have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>Still I mean to fight it out with you. I warn you of that. I'll fight it out with you to the end, and then God will decide.
<p/>Good-by, gentlemen, don't be vexed with me for having shouted at you during the examination. Oh, I was still such a fool then....
<p/>In another minute I shall be a prisoner, but now, for the last time, as a free man, Dmitri Karamazov offers you his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) hand.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) voice quivered and he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) hand, but Nikolay Parfenovitch, who happened to stand nearest to him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>), with a sudden, almost nervous movement, hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) hands behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) back.
<p/>Saying good-by to you, I say it to all men. '' Mitya instantly noticed this, and started. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) let his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) outstretched hand fall at once.
<p/>We will continue it in the town, and I, for my part, of course, am ready to wish you all success ... in your defense....
<p/>As a matter of fact, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, I've always been disposed to regard you as, so to speak, more unfortunate than guilty.
<p/>All of us here, if I may make bold to speak for all, we are all ready to recognize that you are, at bottom, a young man of honor, but, alas, one who has been carried away by certain passions to a somewhat excessive degree...
<p/>'' The preliminary inquiry is not yet over,'' Nikolay Parfenovitch faltered, somewhat embarrassed. '' '' Nikolay Parfenovitch's little figure was positively majestic by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had finished speaking.
<p/>It struck Mitya that in another minute this <div class="bookquote">``boy''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>would take his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arm, lead him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to another corner, and renew their conversation about <div class="bookquote">``girls.
<p/>But many quite irrelevant and inappropriate thoughts sometimes occur even to a prisoner when he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) is being led out to execution.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' Gentlemen, you are good, you are humane, may I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Parfenovitch</b></font>) to say `good-by' for the last time? '' asked Mitya.
<p/>'' Certainly, but considering ... in fact, now it's impossible except in the presence of-- '' '' Oh, well, if it must be so, it must!
<p/>Grushenka was brought in, but the farewell was brief, and of few words, and did not at all satisfy Nikolay Parfenovitch.
<p/>'' Grushenka made a deep bow to Mitya. '' I have told you I am yours, and I will be yours.
<p/>I will follow you for ever, wherever they may send you. Farewell; you are guiltless, though you've been your own undoing.
<p/>'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lips quivered, tears flowed from her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) eyes. '' Forgive me, Grusha, for my love, for ruining you, too, with my love.
<p/>'' Mitya would have said something more, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) broke off and went out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was at once surrounded by men who kept a constant watch on him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>At the bottom of the steps to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had driven up with such a dash the day before with Andrey's three horses, two carts stood in readiness.
<p/>Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, a sturdy, thick-set man with a wrinkled face, was annoyed about something, some sudden irregularity. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was shouting angrily.
<p/>When I stood him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drinks in the tavern, the man had quite a different face,'' thought Mitya, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) got in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) asked Mitya to get into the cart with somewhat excessive surliness. '' At the gates there was a crowd of people, peasants, women and drivers.
<p/>Trifon Borissovitch came down the steps too. All stared at Mitya. <div class="bookquote">``Forgive me at parting, good people!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya shouted suddenly from the cart.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive us too! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heard two or three voices. '' Good-by to you, too, Trifon Borissovitch! '' But Trifon Borissovitch did not even turn round.
<p/>It appeared that everything was not yet ready in the second cart, in which two constables were to accompany Mavriky Mavrikyevitch.
<p/>The peasant who had been ordered to drive the second cart was pulling on his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) smock, stoutly maintaining that it was not his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) turn to go, but Akim's.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was, perhaps, too busy. He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>), too, was shouting and fussing about something. But Akim was not to be seen. They ran to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>).
<p/>The peasant persisted and besought them to wait. '' You see what our peasants are, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch. They've no shame! '' exclaimed Trifon Borissovitch.
<p/>'' Akim gave you twenty-five copecks the day before yesterday. You've drunk it all and now you cry out. I'm simply surprised at your good-nature, with our low peasants, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, that's all I can say.
<p/>'' '' But what do we want a second cart for? '' Mitya put in. <div class="bookquote">``Let's start with the one, Mavriky Mavrikyevitch.
<p/>I won't be unruly, I won't run away from you, old fellow. What do we want an escort for?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll trouble you, sir, to learn how to speak to me if you've never been taught.
<p/>I'm not `old fellow' to you, and you can keep your advice for another time!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mavriky Mavrikyevitch</b></font>)</div>Mavriky Mavrikyevitch snapped out savagely, as though glad to vent his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wrath.
<p/>The rain had ceased, but the dull sky was still overcast with clouds, and a keen wind was blowing straight in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) face.
<p/>Mitya was reduced to silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) flushed all over. A moment later he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) felt suddenly very cold. '' I've taken a chill,'' thought Mitya, twitching his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shoulders.
<p/>At last Mavriky Mavrikyevitch, too, got into the cart, sat down heavily, and, as though without noticing it, squeezed Mitya into the corner.
<p/>It is true that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was out of humor and greatly disliked the task that had been laid upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). ''
<p/>Good-by, Trifon Borissovitch!'' Mitya shouted again, and felt himself, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had not called out this time from good-nature, but involuntarily, from resentment.
<p/>But Trifon Borissovitch stood proudly, with both hands behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) back, and staring straight at Mitya with a stern and angry face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) made no reply.
<p/>'' Good-by, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, good-by! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) heard all at once the voice of Kalganov, who had suddenly darted out. Running up to the cart he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) hand to Mitya.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had no cap on. Mitya had time to seize and press his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hand. '' Good-by, dear fellow! I shan't forget your generosity,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cried warmly.
<p/>Kalganov ran back, sat down in a corner, bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head, hid his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands, and burst out crying.
<p/>For a long while he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sat like that, crying as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) were a little boy instead of a young man of twenty.
<p/>But the cart moved and their hands parted. The bell began ringing and Mitya was driven off. Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) believed almost without doubt in Mitya's guilt.
<p/>'' What are these people? What can men be after this? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) exclaimed incoherently, in bitter despondency, almost despair. At that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had no desire to live.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it worth it? Is it worth it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the boy in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) grief. PART IV Book X. The Boys Chapter I. Kolya Krassotkin
<p/>There had been a hard frost, eleven degrees Réaumur, without snow, but a little dry snow had fallen on the frozen ground during the night, and a keen dry wind was lifting and blowing it along the dreary streets of our town, especially about the market-place.
<p/>It was the beginning of November. It was a dull morning, but the snow had ceased. Not far from the market-place, close to Plotnikov's shop, there stood a small house, very clean both without and within.
<p/>It belonged to Madame Krassotkin, the widow of a former provincial secretary, who had been dead for fourteen years. His (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) widow, still a nice-looking woman of thirty-two, was living in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) neat little house on her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) private means.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was about eighteen at the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) husband's death; she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had been married only a year and had just borne him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) a son.
<p/>From the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) death she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had devoted herself heart and soul to the bringing up of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) precious treasure, her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) boy Kolya.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) lived in respectable seclusion; she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was of a soft but fairly cheerful disposition. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) passionately those fourteen years, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had caused her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) far more suffering than happiness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had been trembling and fainting with terror almost every day, afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would fall ill, would catch cold, do something naughty, climb on a chair and fall off it, and so on and so on.
<p/>When Kolya began going to school, the mother devoted herself to studying all the sciences with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) so as to help him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and go through his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lessons with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hastened to make the acquaintance of the teachers and their wives, even made up to Kolya's schoolfellows, and fawned upon them in the hope of thus saving Kolya from being teased, laughed at, or beaten by them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went so far that the boys actually began to mock at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) account and taunt him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with being a ``mother's darling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a resolute boy, <div class="bookquote">``tremendously strong,''  (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div>as was rumored in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) class, and soon proved to be the fact; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was agile, strong-willed, and of an audacious and enterprising temper.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was good at lessons, and there was a rumor in the school that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could beat the teacher, Dardanelov, at arithmetic and universal history.
<p/>'' But the boy could take his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own part. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked down upon every one, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a good comrade and not supercilious.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) schoolfellows' respect as his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) due, but was friendly with them. Above all, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew where to draw the line.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could restrain himself on occasion, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) relations with the teachers he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) never overstepped that last mystic limit beyond which a prank becomes an unpardonable breach of discipline.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was as fond of mischief on every possible occasion as the smallest boy in the school, and not so much for the sake of mischief as for creating a sensation, inventing something, something effective and conspicuous.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew how to make even his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother give way to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was almost despotic in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) control of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was extremely vain. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave way to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had given way to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) for years. The one thought unendurable to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) boy had no great love for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was always fancying that Kolya was <div class="bookquote">``unfeeling''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and at times, dissolving into hysterical tears, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used to reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) coldness.
<p/>The boy disliked this, and the more demonstrations of feeling were demanded of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) the more he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seemed intentionally to avoid them.
<p/>Yet it was not intentional on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) part but instinctive--it was his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) character. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother was mistaken; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) only disliked <div class="bookquote">``sheepish sentimentality,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) expressed it in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) schoolboy language. There was a bookcase in the house containing a few books that had been his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father's.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother did not mind that and only wondered sometimes at seeing the boy stand for hours by the bookcase poring over a book instead of going to play.
<p/>Kolya was fond of reading, and had read several of them by himself. And in that way Kolya read some things unsuitable for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) age.
<p/>Though the boy, as a rule, knew where to draw the line in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mischief, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had of late begun to play pranks that caused his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother serious alarm.
<p/>It happened that July, during the summer holidays, that the mother and son went to another district, forty-five miles away, to spend a week with a distant relation, whose husband was an official at the railway station -LRB-the very station, the nearest one to our town, from which a month later Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov set off for Moscow-RRB-.
<p/>There Kolya began by carefully investigating every detail connected with the railways, knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) could impress his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) schoolfellows when he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) got home with his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) newly acquired knowledge.
<p/>It is true there was nothing vicious in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) did, but a wild mad recklessness. But there happened to be some other boys in the place with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) soon made friends.
<p/>Some of them were living at the station, others in the neighborhood; there were six or seven of them, all between twelve and fifteen, and two of them came from our town.
<p/>The boys played together, and on the fourth or fifth day of Kolya's stay at the station, a mad bet was made by the foolish boys.
<p/>Kolya, who was almost the youngest of the party and rather looked down upon by the others in consequence, was moved by vanity or by reckless bravado to bet them two roubles that he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) would lie down between the rails at night when the eleven o'clock train was due, and would lie there without moving while the train rolled over him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) at full speed.
<p/>It is true they made a preliminary investigation, from which it appeared that it was possible to lie so flat between the rails that the train could pass over without touching, but to lie there was no joke!
<p/>Kolya maintained stoutly that he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) would. At first they laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>), called him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) a little liar, a braggart, but that only egged him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) on.
<p/>What piqued him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) most was that these boys of fifteen turned up their noses at him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) too superciliously, and were at first disposed to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) as <div class="bookquote">``a small boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>not fit to associate with them, and that was an unendurable insult.
<p/>And so it was resolved to go in the evening, half a mile from the station, so that the train might have time to get up full speed after leaving the station.
<p/>The boys assembled. It was a pitch-dark night without a moon. At the time fixed, Kolya lay down between the rails.
<p/>The five others who had taken the bet waited among the bushes below the embankment, their hearts beating with suspense, which was followed by alarm and remorse.
<p/>At last they heard in the distance the rumble of the train leaving the station. Two red lights gleamed out of the darkness; the monster roared as it approached.
<p/>'' Run, run away from the rails,'' the boys cried to Kolya from the bushes, breathless with terror. But it was too late: the train darted up and flew past.
<p/>The boys rushed to Kolya. He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) lay without moving. They began pulling at him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), lifting him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) up. He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) suddenly got up and walked away without a word.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had lain there as though he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) were insensible to frighten them, but the fact was that he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) really had lost consciousness, as he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) confessed long after to his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) mother.
<p/>In this way his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) reputation as <div class="bookquote">``a desperate character,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>was established for ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) returned home to the station as white as a sheet.
<p/>Next day he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had a slight attack of nervous fever, but he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was in high spirits and well pleased with himself.
<p/>The incident did not become known at once, but when they came back to the town it penetrated to the school and even reached the ears of the masters.
<p/>But then Kolya's mother hastened to entreat the masters on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) boy's behalf, and in the end Dardanelov, a respected and influential teacher, exerted himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) favor, and the affair was ignored.
<p/>Dardanelov was a middle-aged bachelor, who had been passionately in love with Madame Krassotkin for many years past, and had once already, about a year previously, ventured, trembling with fear and the delicacy of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sentiments, to offer her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) most respectfully his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand in marriage.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) refused him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) resolutely, feeling that to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would be an act of treachery to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son, though Dardanelov had, to judge from certain mysterious symptoms, reason for believing that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was not an object of aversion to the charming but too chaste and tender-hearted widow.
<p/>Kolya's mad prank seemed to have broken the ice, and Dardanelov was rewarded for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) intercession by a suggestion of hope.
<p/>The suggestion, it is true, was a faint one, but then Dardanelov was such a paragon of purity and delicacy that it was enough for the time being to make him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) perfectly happy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was fond of the boy, though he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would have felt it beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to try and win him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) over, and was severe and strict with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in class.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) learned his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) lessons perfectly; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was second in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) class, was reserved with Dardanelov, and the whole class firmly believed that Kolya was so good at universal history that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could <div class="bookquote">``beat''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>even Dardanelov.
<p/>Kolya did indeed ask him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) the question, <div class="bookquote">``Who founded Troy?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>to which Dardanelov had made a very vague reply, referring to the movements and migrations of races, to the remoteness of the period, to the mythical legends.
<p/>But the question, <div class="bookquote">``Who had founded Troy?''  (<font color='red'><b>individuals</b></font>)</div>that is, what individuals, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could not answer, and even for some reason regarded the question as idle and frivolous.
<p/>Kolya, too, kept him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) at a respectful distance. But the boys remained convinced that Dardanelov did not know who founded Troy.
<p/>In the end all the boys became interested in the question, who it was that had founded Troy, but Krassotkin would not tell his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) secret, and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) reputation for knowledge remained unshaken.
<p/>Kolya had read of the founders of Troy in Smaragdov, whose history was among the books in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father's bookcase. After the incident on the railway a certain change came over Kolya's attitude to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had such terrible attacks of hysterics, lasting with intervals for several days, that Kolya, seriously alarmed at last, promised on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) honor that such pranks should never be repeated.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) swore on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) knees before the holy image, and swore by the memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father, at Madame Krassotkin's instance, and the <div class="bookquote">``manly''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>Kolya burst into tears like a boy of six.
<p/>When Anna Fyodorovna -LRB-Madame Krassotkin-RRB- heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovna</b></font>) son's exploit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovna</b></font>) almost went out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovna</b></font>) mind with horror. And all that day the mother and son were constantly rushing into each other's arms sobbing.
<p/>Next day Kolya woke up as <div class="bookquote">``unfeeling''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>as before, but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had become more silent, more modest, sterner, and more thoughtful.
<p/>Six weeks later, it is true, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) got into another scrape, which even brought his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) name to the ears of our Justice of the Peace, but it was a scrape of quite another kind, amusing, foolish, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did not, as it turned out, take the leading part in it, but was only implicated in it.
<p/>But of this later. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother still fretted and trembled, but the more uneasy she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) became, the greater were the hopes of Dardanelov.
<p/>It must be noted that Kolya understood and divined what was in Dardanelov's heart and, of course, despised him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) profoundly for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``feelings'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had in the past been so tactless as to show this contempt before his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother, hinting vaguely that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) knew what Dardanelov was after.
<p/>But from the time of the railway incident his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) behavior in this respect also was changed; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did not allow himself the remotest allusion to the subject and began to speak more respectfully of Dardanelov before his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother, which the sensitive woman at once appreciated with boundless gratitude.
<p/>But at the slightest mention of Dardanelov by a visitor in Kolya's presence, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would flush as pink as a rose.
<p/>At such moments Kolya would either stare out of the window scowling, or would investigate the state of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) boots, or would shout angrily for <div class="bookquote">``Perezvon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>the big, shaggy, mangy dog, which he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had picked up a month before, brought home, and kept for some reason secretly indoors, not showing him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) to any of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) schoolfellows.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) bullied him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) frightfully, teaching him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) all sorts of tricks, so that the poor dog howled for him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was absent at school, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) came in, whined with delight, rushed about as if he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) were crazy, begged, lay down on the ground pretending to be dead, and so on; in fact, showed all the tricks he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), not at the word of command, but simply from the zeal of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) excited and grateful heart.
<p/>I have forgotten, by the way, to mention that Kolya Krassotkin was the boy stabbed with a penknife by the boy already known to the reader as the son of Captain Snegiryov.
<p/>Ilusha had been defending his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) father when the schoolboys jeered at him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), shouting the nickname <div class="bookquote">``wisp of tow. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Chapter II.
<p/>Children And so on that frosty, snowy, and windy day in November, Kolya Krassotkin was sitting at home. It was Sunday and there was no school.
<p/>It had just struck eleven, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) particularly wanted to go out <div class="bookquote">``on very urgent business,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was left alone in charge of the house, for it so happened that all its elder inmates were absent owing to a sudden and singular event.
<p/>Madame Krassotkin had let two little rooms, separated from the rest of the house by a passage, to a doctor's wife with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) two small children.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, the doctor, had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) departure twelve months before, going first to Orenburg and then to Tashkend, and for the last six months she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had not heard a word from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>Had it not been for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) friendship with Madame Krassotkin, which was some consolation to the forsaken lady, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would certainly have completely dissolved away in tears.
<p/>And now, to add to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) misfortunes, Katerina, her (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) only servant, was suddenly moved the evening before to announce, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) mistress's amazement, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) proposed to bring a child into the world before morning.
<p/>This lady was the same age as Anna Fyodorovna, and a great friend of hers. It seemed almost miraculous to every one that no one had noticed the probability of it before.
<p/>The astounded doctor's wife decided to move Katerina while there was still time to an establishment in the town kept by a midwife for such emergencies.
<p/>By the morning all Madame Krassotkin's friendly sympathy and energy were called upon to render assistance and appeal to some one for help in the case.
<p/>So both the ladies were absent from home, the Krassotkins' servant, Agafya, had gone out to the market, and Kolya was thus left for a time to protect and look after <div class="bookquote">``the kids,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>that is, the son and daughter of the doctor's wife, who were left alone.
<p/>Kolya was not afraid of taking care of the house, besides he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had Perezvon, who had been told to lie flat, without moving, under the bench in the hall.
<p/>Every time Kolya, walking to and fro through the rooms, came into the hall, the dog shook his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head and gave two loud and insinuating taps on the floor with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) tail, but alas!
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) set great store by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) servant, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) promptly carried out this plan and remained there looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). the whistle did not sound to release him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>).
<p/>Kolya looked sternly at the luckless dog, who relapsed again into obedient rigidity. The one thing that troubled Kolya was ``the kids.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) looked, of course, with the utmost scorn on Katerina's unexpected adventure, but he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was very fond of the bereaved <div class="bookquote">``kiddies,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and had already taken them a picture-book.
<p/>Nastya, the elder, a girl of eight, could read, and Kostya, the boy, aged seven, was very fond of being read to by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) could have made them stand side by side and played soldiers with them, or sent them hiding all over the house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) had done so more than once before and was not above doing it, so much so that a report once spread at school that Krassotkin played horses with the little lodgers at home, prancing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) head on one side like a trace-horse.
<p/>But Krassotkin haughtily parried this thrust, pointing out that to play horses with boys of one's own age, boys of thirteen, would certainly be disgraceful <div class="bookquote">``at this date,''  (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div>but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) did it for the sake of <div class="bookquote">``the kids''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>because he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) liked them, and no one had a right to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) to account for his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) feelings.
<p/>'' Krassotkin could, of course, have provided more diverting entertainment for them. The two <div class="bookquote">``kids''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>adored him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>). But on this occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) was in no mood for games.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) had very important business of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) own before him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>), something almost mysterious. Meanwhile time was passing and Agafya, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) could have left the children, would not come back from market.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) had several times already crossed the passage, opened the door of the lodgers' room and looked anxiously at <div class="bookquote">``the kids''  (<font color='red'><b>the lodgers</b></font>)</div>who were sitting over the book, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) had bidden them.
<p/>Every time he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) opened the door they grinned at him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>), hoping he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) would come in and would do something delightful and amusing.
<p/>At last it struck eleven and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) mind, once for all, that if that <div class="bookquote">``damned''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Agafya did not come back within ten minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) should go out without waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>), making <div class="bookquote">``the kids''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>promise, of course, to be brave when he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) was away, not to be naughty, not to cry from fright.
<p/>With this idea he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) wadded winter overcoat with its catskin fur collar, slung his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) satchel round his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) shoulder, and, regardless of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) mother's constantly reiterated entreaties that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) would always put on goloshes in such cold weather, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) looked at them contemptuously as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) crossed the hall and went out with only his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) boots on.
<p/>But Kolya was bothered and did not go in. Perezvon, seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) outdoor clothes, began tapping nervously, yet vigorously, on the floor with his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) tail.
<p/>But Kolya, seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) dog's passionate excitement, decided that it was a breach of discipline, kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) for another minute under the bench, and only when he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) had opened the door into the passage, whistled for him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>).
<p/>Twitching all over, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) even uttered a plaintive whine. The dog leapt up like a mad creature and rushed bounding before him (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) rapturously.
<p/>Kolya opened the door to peep at <div class="bookquote">``the kids. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>They were both sitting as before at the table, not reading but warmly disputing about something.
<p/>The children often argued together about various exciting problems of life, and Nastya, being the elder, always got the best of it.
<p/>If Kostya did not agree with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) almost always appealed to Kolya Krassotkin, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) verdict was regarded as infallible by both of them.
<p/>This time the <div class="bookquote">``kids'''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>discussion rather interested Krassotkin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) stood still in the passage to listen. The children saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) was listening and that made them dispute with even greater energy.
<p/>'' I shall never, never believe,'' Nastya prattled, <div class="bookquote">``that the old women find babies among the cabbages in the kitchen-garden. It's winter now and there are no cabbages,
<p/>and so the old woman couldn't have taken Katerina a daughter.''  (<font color='red'><b>Nastya</b></font>)</div>Kolya whistled to himself. '' Or perhaps they do bring babies from somewhere, but only to those who are married.
<p/>'' Kostya stared at Nastya and listened, pondering profoundly. '' Nastya, how silly you are! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) said at last, firmly and calmly.
<p/>'' How can Katerina have a baby when she (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) isn't married? '' Nastya was exasperated. '' You know nothing about it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) snapped irritably.
<p/>'' Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) has a husband, only he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is in prison, so now she (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>)'s got a baby. '' '' But is her (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) husband in prison?'' the matter-of-fact Kostya inquired gravely.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) hasn't a husband, you are right there, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) wants to be married, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>)'s been thinking of getting married, and thinking and thinking of it till now
<p/>'' Or, I tell you what,'' Nastya interrupted impulsively, completely rejecting and forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) first hypothesis. '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>)'s got it, that is, not a husband but a baby.
<p/>'' '' Well, perhaps so,'' Kostya agreed, entirely vanquished. '' But you didn't say so before. So how could I tell?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, kiddies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>said Kolya, stepping into the room. '' You're terrible people, I see.'' '' And Perezvon with you! '' grinned Kostya, and began snapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) fingers and calling Perezvon.
<p/>'' I am in a difficulty, kids,'' Krassotkin began solemnly, <div class="bookquote">``and you must help me. Agafya must have broken her (<font color='blue'><b>Krassotkin</b></font>) leg, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Krassotkin</b></font>) has not turned up till now, that's certain.
<p/>I must go out. Will you let me go? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>The children looked anxiously at one another. Their smiling faces showed signs of uneasiness, but they did not yet fully grasp what was expected of them.
<p/>'' You won't be naughty while I am gone? You won't climb on the cupboard and break your legs? You won't be frightened alone and cry?
<p/>'' A look of profound despondency came into the children's faces. '' And I could show you something as a reward, a little copper cannon which can be fired with real gunpowder.
<p/>'' The children's faces instantly brightened. <div class="bookquote">``Show us the cannon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kostya</b></font>)</div>said Kostya, beaming all over. Krassotkin put his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) satchel, and pulling out a little bronze cannon stood it on the table.
<p/>'' Ah, you are bound to ask that! Look, it's on wheels. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) rolled the toy on along the table.
<p/>'' And it can be fired off, too. It can be loaded with shot and fired off.'' '' And it could kill any one?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It can kill any one; you've only got to aim at anybody,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>and Krassotkin explained where the powder had to be put, where the shot should be rolled in, showing a tiny hole like a touch-hole, and told them that it kicked when it was fired.
<p/>The children listened with intense interest. What particularly struck their imagination was that the cannon kicked. '' And have you got any powder?''
<p/>Nastya inquired. '' Yes.'' <div class="bookquote">``Show us the powder, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) drawled with a smile of entreaty. Krassotkin dived again into his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) satchel and pulled out a small flask containing a little real gunpowder.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had some shot, too, in a screw of paper. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) even uncorked the flask and shook a little powder into the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hand.
<p/>One has to be careful there's no fire about, or it would blow up and kill us all,'' Krassotkin warned them sensationally.
<p/>'' The children gazed at the powder with an awe-stricken alarm that only intensified their enjoyment. But Kostya liked the shot better.
<p/>'' And does the shot burn? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) inquired. '' No, it doesn't.'' <div class="bookquote">``Give me a little shot,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) asked in an imploring voice.
<p/>I'll give you a little shot; here, take it, but don't show it to your mother till I come back, or she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'ll be sure to think it's gunpowder, and will die of fright and give you a thrashing.''
<p/>'' '' Mother never does whip us,'' Nastya observed at once. '' I know, I only said it to finish the sentence.
<p/>And don't you ever deceive your mother except just this once, until I come back. And so, kiddies, can I go out?
<p/>You won't be frightened and cry when I'm gone?'' <div class="bookquote">``We sha--all cry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kostya</b></font>)</div>drawled Kostya, on the verge of tears already. ''
<p/>We shall cry, we shall be sure to cry,'' Nastya chimed in with timid haste. '' Oh, children, children, how fraught with peril are your years!
<p/>There's no help for it, chickens, I shall have to stay with you I don't know how long. And time is passing, time is passing, oogh!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell Perezvon to pretend to be dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kostya</b></font>)</div>Kostya begged. '' There's no help for it, we must have recourse to Perezvon.
<p/>Ici , Perezvon. '' And Kolya began giving orders to the dog, who performed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) tricks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) was a rough-haired dog, of medium size, with a coat of a sort of lilac- gray color.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) whined and jumped, stood and walked on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) hind legs, lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) back with his (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) paws in the air, rigid as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Kostya</b></font>) were dead.
<p/>While this last performance was going on, the door opened and Agafya, Madame Krassotkin's servant, a stout woman of forty, marked with small-pox, appeared in the doorway.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was blind in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) right eye, and his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) left ear was torn. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had come back from market and had a bag full of provisions in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Though Kolya had been so anxious for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) return, he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) did not cut short the performance, and after keeping Perezvon dead for the usual time, at last he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) whistled to him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>).
<p/>Holding up the bag of provisions in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) left hand she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood still to watch the dog. The dog jumped up and began bounding about in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) joy at having done his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) duty.
<p/>'' Only think, a dog!'' Agafya observed sententiously. '' Why are you late, female? '' asked Krassotkin sternly. '' Female, indeed!
<p/>What is it to you if I'm late; if I'm late, you may be sure I have good reason,'' muttered Agafya, busying herself about the stove, without a trace of anger or displeasure in her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) voice.
<p/>Go on with you, you brat.'' <div class="bookquote">``Brat?''  (<font color='red'><b>a brat</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, a brat. She (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) seemed quite pleased, in fact, to enjoy a skirmish with her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) merry young master.
<p/>Listen, you frivolous young woman,'' Krassotkin began, getting up from the sofa, <div class="bookquote">``can you swear by all you hold sacred in the world and something else besides, that you will watch vigilantly over the kids in my absence?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>I am going out.'' '' And what am I going to swear for? '' laughed Agafya. '' I shall look after them without that.''
<p/>'' No, you must swear on your eternal salvation. Else I shan't go. '' ``Well, don't then. What does it matter to me?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kids,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>Kolya turned to the children, <div class="bookquote">``this woman will stay with you till I come back or till your mother comes, for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ought to have been back long ago.
<p/>It's cold out; stay at home.''  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will give you some lunch, too. You'll give them something, Agafya, won't you?'' <div class="bookquote">``That I can do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>granny</b></font>)</div><p/>And you, granny,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) added gravely, in an undertone, as he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) passed Agafya, ``I hope you'll spare their tender years and not tell them any of your old woman's nonsense about Katerina.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-by, chickens, I go with my heart at rest. Ici , Perezvon!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Get along with you! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Agafya/Agafya Ivanovna</b></font>)</div>retorted Agafya, really angry this time.
<p/>'' Ridiculous boy! You want a whipping for saying such things, that's what you want!'' Chapter III. The Schoolboy But Kolya did not hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>).
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went out at the gate he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked round him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), shrugged up his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shoulders, and saying <div class="bookquote">``It is freezing,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>went straight along the street and turned off to the right towards the market-place.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) reached the last house but one before the market-place he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stopped at the gate, pulled a whistle out of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pocket, and whistled with all his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might as though giving a signal.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had not to wait more than a minute before a rosy-cheeked boy of about eleven, wearing a warm, neat and even stylish coat, darted out to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could go out. This was Smurov, a boy in the preparatory class -LRB-two classes below Kolya Krassotkin-RRB-, son of a well-to-do official.
<p/>Apparently he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) was forbidden by his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) parents to associate with Krassotkin, who was well known to be a desperately naughty boy, so Smurov was obviously slipping out on the sly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was--if the reader has not forgotten--one of the group of boys who two months before had thrown stones at Ilusha.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was the one who told Alyosha Karamazov about Ilusha. '' I've been waiting for you for the last hour, Krassotkin,'' said Smurov stolidly, and the boys strode towards the market-place.
<p/>'' I am late,'' answered Krassotkin. '' I was detained by circumstances. You won't be thrashed for coming with me?'' <div class="bookquote">``Come, I say, I'm never thrashed!
<p/>And you've got Perezvon with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' You're taking him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), too?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! if it were only Zhutchka!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' That's impossible.
<p/>Zhutchka's non-existent. Zhutchka is lost in the mists of obscurity.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! couldn't we do this?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Smurov suddenly stood still. '' You see Ilusha says that Zhutchka was a shaggy, grayish, smoky-looking dog like Perezvon.
<p/>Couldn't you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) this is Zhutchka, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might believe you?'' <div class="bookquote">``Boy, shun a lie, that's one thing; even with a good object--that's another.
<p/>Above all, I hope you've not told them anything about my coming. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Heaven forbid! I know what I am about.
<p/>You know his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father, the captain, `the wisp of tow,' told us that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was going to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a real mastiff pup, with a black nose, to-day.
<p/>But you won't comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with Perezvon,'' said Smurov, with a sigh. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thinks that would comfort Ilusha; but I doubt it.''
<p/>'' And how is Ilusha?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is bad, very bad! I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s in consumption: he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is quite conscious, but his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) breathing!
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) breathing's gone wrong. The other day he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked to have his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) boots on to be led round the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tried to walk, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) couldn't stand. '
<p/>Ah, I told you before, father,' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, `that those boots were no good. I could never walk properly in them.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fancied it was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) boots that made him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stagger, but it was simply weakness, really. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) won't live another week.

<p/>But I allow no one to analyze my actions.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And how pleased Ilusha will be to see you! He (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) has no idea that you are coming.
<p/>Why was it , why was it you wouldn't come all this time?'' Smurov cried with sudden warmth. '' My dear boy, that's my business, not yours.
<p/>I am going of myself because I choose to, but you've all been hauled there by Alexey Karamazov-- there's a difference, you know.
<p/>And how do you know? I may not be going to make it up at all. It's a stupid expression.'' ''
<p/>It's not Karamazov at all; it's not his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) doing. Our fellows began going there of themselves. Of course, they went with Karamazov at first.
<p/>And there's been nothing of that sort--no silliness. First one went, and then another. His (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) father was awfully pleased to see us.
<p/>You know he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) will simply go out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) mind if Ilusha dies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) sees that Ilusha's dying. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) seems so glad we've made it up with Ilusha.
<p/>Ilusha asked after you, that was all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) just asks and says no more. His (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) father will go out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) mind or hang himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) behaved like a madman before. You know he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) is a very decent man. We made a mistake then. It's all the fault of that murderer who beat him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) then.''
<p/>'' Karamazov's a riddle to me all the same. I might have made his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) acquaintance long ago, but I like to have a proper pride in some cases.
<p/>Besides, I have a theory about him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) which I must work out and verify. '' Kolya subsided into dignified silence. Smurov, too, was silent.
<p/>Smurov, of course, worshiped Krassotkin and never dreamed of putting himself on a level with him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>). Now he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was tremendously interested at Kolya's saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``going of himself''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>to see Ilusha.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) felt that there must be some mystery in Kolya's suddenly taking it into his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) head to go to him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) that day.
<p/>They crossed the market-place, in which at that hour were many loaded wagons from the country and a great number of live fowls.
<p/>The market women were selling rolls, cottons and threads, etc., in their booths. These Sunday markets were naďvely called <div class="bookquote">``fairs''  (<font color='red'><b>Perezvon</b></font>)</div>in the town, and there were many such fairs in the year.
<p/>Perezvon ran about in the wildest spirits, sniffing about first one side, then the other. When he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) met other dogs they zealously smelt each other over according to the rules of canine etiquette.
<p/>'' I like to watch such realistic scenes, Smurov,'' said Kolya suddenly. '' Have you noticed how dogs sniff at one another when they meet?
<p/>It seems to be a law of their nature.'' '' Yes; it's a funny habit.'' '' No, it's not funny; you are wrong there.
<p/>If dogs could reason and criticize us they'd be sure to find just as much that would be funny to them, if not far more, in the social relations of men, their masters--far more, indeed.
<p/>There's nothing funny in nature, however funny it may seem to man with his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) prejudices. I repeat that, because I am convinced that there is far more foolishness among us.
<p/>That's when all are equal and all have property in common, there are no marriages, and every one has any religion and laws he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) likes best, and all the rest of it.
<p/>That's Rakitin's idea--a remarkable idea. I am a Socialist, Smurov.'' '' And what is a Socialist?'' asked Smurov. '' You are not old enough to understand that yet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you noticed, Smurov, that in the middle of winter we don't feel so cold even when there are fifteen or eighteen degrees of frost as we do now, in the beginning of winter, when there is a sudden frost of twelve degrees, especially when there is not much snow.

<p/>Everything is habit with men, everything even in their social and political relations. Habit is the great motive-power. What a funny-looking peasant!''
<p/>Kolya pointed to a tall peasant, with a good-natured countenance in a long sheepskin coat, who was standing by his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) wagon, clapping together his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) hands, in their shapeless leather gloves, to warm them.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) long fair beard was all white with frost. '' That peasant's beard's frozen,'' Kolya cried in a loud provocative voice as he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) passed him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>).
<p/>'' Lots of people's beards are frozen,'' the peasant replied, calmly and sententiously. '' Don't provoke him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>),'' observed Smurov. '' It's all right; he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) won't be cross; he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>)'s a nice fellow.
<p/>Good-by, Matvey.'' <div class="bookquote">``Good-by. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is your name Matvey?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. Didn't you know?'' '' No, I didn't. It was a guess.

<p/>'' Good-by, Matvey.'' <div class="bookquote">``Good-by. You are a nice chap, that you are. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The boys</b></font>)</div>The boys went on. '' That was a nice peasant,'' Kolya observed to Smurov.
<p/>'' I like talking to the peasants, and am always glad to do them justice.'' <div class="bookquote">``Why did you tell a lie, pretending we are thrashed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Smurov</b></font>)</div>asked Smurov.

<p/>But you don't understand that. One has to know how to talk to the peasants. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Only don't tease them, please, or you'll get into another scrape as you did about that goose.''
<p/>'' So you're afraid?'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't laugh, Kolya. Of course I'm afraid. My father would be awfully cross. I am strictly forbidden to go out with you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Call me Natasha! What next! My name is Marya,''  (<font color='red'><b>the market woman</b></font>)</div>the middle-aged market woman shouted at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). '' I am so glad it's Marya.
<p/>Good-by!'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, you young rascal! A brat like you to carry on so!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm in a hurry. I can't stay now.
<p/>You shall tell me next Sunday.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>Kolya waved his (<font color='blue'><b>brat</b></font>) hand at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marya</b></font>), as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marya</b></font>) had attacked him (<font color='blue'><b>brat</b></font>) and not he (<font color='blue'><b>brat</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Marya</b></font>).
<p/>'' I've nothing to tell you next Sunday. You set upon me, you impudent young monkey. I didn't say anything,'' bawled Marya.
<p/>'' You want a whipping, that's what you want, you saucy jackanapes! '' There was a roar of laughter among the other market women round her (<font color='blue'><b>Marya</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) was a young man, not a native of the town, with dark, curly hair and a long, pale face, marked with smallpox.
<p/>Suddenly a man in a violent rage darted out from the arcade of shops close by. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore a long blue coat and a peaked cap, and looked like a merchant's clerk.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in a state of stupid excitement and brandished his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fist at Kolya. '' I know you!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried angrily, <div class="bookquote">``I know you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Kolya stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not recall when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could have had a row with the man. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been in so many rows in the street that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hardly remember them all.
<p/>'' Do you? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked sarcastically. '' I know you! I know you! '' the man repeated idiotically. '' So much the better for you.
<p/>Well, it's time I was going. Good-by!'' <div class="bookquote">``You are at your saucy pranks again?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>cried the man. '' You are at your saucy pranks again?
<p/>I know, you are at it again!'' '' It's not your business, brother, if I am at my saucy pranks again,'' said Kolya, standing still and scanning him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
<p/>'' Not my business?'' '' No; it's not your business.'' '' Whose then? Whose then? Whose then?'' '' It's Trifon Nikititch's business, not yours.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What Trifon Nikititch?''  (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div>asked the youth, staring with loutish amazement at Kolya, but still as angry as ever. Kolya scanned him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) gravely.
<p/>'' Have you been to the Church of the Ascension? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) suddenly asked him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), with stern emphasis. '' What Church of Ascension?
<p/>What for? No, I haven't,'' said the young man, somewhat taken aback. '' Do you know Sabaneyev? '' Kolya went on even more emphatically and even more severely.
<p/>Well then you can go to the devil,'' said Kolya, cutting short the conversation; and turning sharply to the right he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) strode quickly on his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) way as though he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) disdained further conversation with a dolt who did not even know Sabaneyev.
<p/>'' What Sabaneyev? No, I don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>).'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Stop, heigh! What Sabaneyev? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>the young man recovered from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) momentary stupefaction and was as excited as before.
<p/>'' What did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) say? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned to the market women with a silly stare. The women laughed. '' You can never tell what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s after,'' said one of them.
<p/>'' What Sabaneyev is it he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s talking about? '' the young man repeated, still furious and brandishing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right arm. ''
<p/>It must be a Sabaneyev who worked for the Kuzmitchovs, that's who it must be,'' one of the women suggested. The young man stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wildly.
<p/>'' For the Kuzmitchovs?'' repeated another woman. '' But his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name wasn't Trifon. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name's Kuzma, not Trifon; but the boy said Trifon Nikititch, so it can't be the same.''
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) name is not Trifon and not Sabaneyev, it's Tchizhov,'' put in suddenly a third woman, who had hitherto been silent, listening gravely.
<p/>'' '' Alexey Ivanitch is his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanitch</b></font>) name. Tchizhov, Alexey Ivanitch. '' <div class="bookquote">``Not a doubt about it, it's Tchizhov,''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>a fourth woman emphatically confirmed the statement.
<p/>The bewildered youth gazed from one to another. '' But what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanitch</b></font>) ask for, what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanitch</b></font>) ask for, good people?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanitch</b></font>) cried almost in desperation. '' `Do you know Sabaneyev?' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanitch</b></font>). And who the devil's to know who is Sabaneyev?''
<p/>'' You're a senseless fellow. I tell you it's not Sabaneyev, but Tchizhov, Alexey Ivanitch Tchizhov, that's who it is!'' one of the women shouted at him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) impressively.
<p/>'' What Tchizhov? Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)? Tell me, if you know.'' '' That tall, sniveling fellow who used to sit in the market in the summer.''
<p/>'' And what's your Tchizhov to do with me, good people, eh?'' <div class="bookquote">``How can I tell what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s to do with you?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>put in another. '' You ought to know yourself what you want with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), if you make such a clamor about him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) spoke to you, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did not speak to us, you stupid.

 (<font color='red'><b>The devil</b></font>)</div><p/>'' The devil take Tchizhov and you with him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>). I'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) a hiding, that I will. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was laughing at me!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will give Tchizhov a hiding! More likely he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) will give you one. You are a fool, that's what you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not Tchizhov, not Tchizhov, you spiteful, mischievous woman.
<p/>I'll give the boy a hiding. Catch him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), catch him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was laughing at me!''  (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div>The woman guffawed. But Kolya was by now a long way off, marching along with a triumphant air.
<p/>Smurov walked beside him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), looking round at the shouting group far behind. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) too was in high spirits, though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was still afraid of getting into some scrape in Kolya's company.
<p/>'' What Sabaneyev did you mean? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked Kolya, foreseeing what his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) answer would be. '' How do I know?
<p/>Now there'll be a hubbub among them all day. I like to stir up fools in every class of society. There's another blockhead, that peasant there.
<p/>You know, they say `there's no one stupider than a stupid Frenchman,' but a stupid Russian shows it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) face just as much.
<p/>Can't you see it all over his (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) is a fool, that peasant, eh?'' <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) alone, Kolya. Let's go on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>A peasant</b></font>)</div><p/>A sturdy-looking peasant, with a round, simple face and grizzled beard, who was walking by, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) head and looked at the boy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing could stop me, now I am once off. Hey, good morning, peasant!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) seemed not quite sober. '' Good morning, if you are not laughing at me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) said deliberately in reply.
<p/>'' And if I am?'' laughed Kolya. '' Well, a joke's a joke. Laugh away. I don't mind. There's no harm in a joke.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I beg your pardon, brother, it was a joke.''  (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>'' Well, God forgive you!'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you forgive me, too?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I quite forgive you.
<p/>Go along.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I say, you seem a clever peasant.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cleverer than you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the peasant</b></font>)</div>the peasant answered unexpectedly, with the same gravity. ''
<p/>I doubt it,'' said Kolya, somewhat taken aback. '' It's true, though.'' <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps it is. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is, brother.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good-by, peasant!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-by!''  (<font color='red'><b>peasants</b></font>)</div>'' There are all sorts of peasants,'' Kolya observed to Smurov after a brief silence. '' How could I tell I had hit on a clever one?
<p/>The boys made haste and they walked as far as Captain Snegiryov's lodging, a considerable distance, quickly and almost in silence.
<p/>Twenty paces from the house Kolya stopped and told Smurov to go on ahead and ask Karamazov to come out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).
<p/>I am always ready to recognize intelligence in the peasantry. '' In the distance the cathedral clock struck half-past eleven. ''
<p/>One must sniff round a bit first,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) observed to Smurov. '' Why ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) to come out?'' Smurov protested. ''
<p/>You go in; they will be awfully glad to see you. What's the sense of making friends in the frost out here?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know why I want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) out here in the frost,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>Kolya cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) short in the despotic tone he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was fond of adopting with <div class="bookquote">``small boys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and Smurov ran to do his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) bidding.
<p/>Chapter IV. The Lost Dog Kolya leaned against the fence with an air of dignity, waiting for Alyosha to appear. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had long wanted to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had heard a great deal about him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) from the boys, but hitherto he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had always maintained an appearance of disdainful indifference when he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was mentioned, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had even <div class="bookquote">``criticized''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>what he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) heard about Alyosha.
<p/>But secretly he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had a great longing to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) acquaintance; there was something sympathetic and attractive in all he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was told about Alyosha.
<p/>So the present moment was important: to begin with, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had to show himself at his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) best, to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) independence, <div class="bookquote">``Or he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)'ll think of me as thirteen and take me for a boy, like the rest of them.
<p/>And what are these boys to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)? I shall ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) when I get to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>). It's a pity I am so short, though.
<p/>Tuzikov is younger than I am, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is half a head taller. But I have a clever face. I am not good-looking.
<p/>I know I'm hideous, but I've a clever face. I mustn't talk too freely; if I fall into his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) arms all at once, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) may think--Tfoo!
<p/>how horrible if he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) should think--! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Such were the thoughts that excited Kolya while he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) utmost to assume the most independent air.
<p/>What distressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) most was his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) being so short ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) did not mind so much his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``hideous''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>face, as being so short.
<p/>On the wall in a corner at home he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had the year before made a pencil-mark to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) height, and every two months since he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) anxiously measured himself against it to see how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had gained.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) face was in reality by no means <div class="bookquote">``hideous'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>; on the contrary, it was rather attractive, with a fair, pale skin, freckled.
<p/>But alas! he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) grew very slowly, and this sometimes reduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) almost to despair. His (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) small, lively gray eyes had a fearless look, and often glowed with feeling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had rather high cheekbones; small, very red, but not very thick, lips; his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) nose was small and unmistakably turned up.
<p/>I've a regular pug nose, a regular pug nose,'' Kolya used to mutter to himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) looked in the looking-glass, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) always left it with indignation.
<p/>'' '' But perhaps I haven't got a clever face? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) sometimes thought, doubtful even of that. But it must not be supposed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) mind was preoccupied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) face and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) height.
<p/>On the contrary, however bitter the moments before the looking-glass were to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) quickly forgot them, and forgot them for a long time, <div class="bookquote">``abandoning himself entirely to ideas and to real life,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) formulated it to himself.
<p/>Alyosha came out quickly and hastened up to Kolya. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), Kolya could see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) looked delighted. ''
<p/>Can he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) be so glad to see me?'' Kolya wondered, feeling pleased. We may note here, in passing, that Alyosha's appearance had undergone a complete change since we saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) last.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had abandoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) cassock and was wearing now a well-cut coat, a soft, round hat, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hair had been cropped short.
<p/>All this was very becoming to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) looked quite handsome. His (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) charming face always had a good-humored expression; but there was a gentleness and serenity in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) good-humor.
<p/>To Kolya's surprise, Alyosha came out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was, without an overcoat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had evidently come in haste.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) hand to Kolya at once. '' Here you are at last! How anxious we've been to see you!''
<p/>'' There were reasons which you shall know directly. Anyway, I am glad to make your acquaintance. I've long been hoping for an opportunity, and have heard a great deal about you,'' Kolya muttered, a little breathless.
<p/>'' We should have met anyway. I've heard a great deal about you, too; but you've been a long time coming here.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, how are things going?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ilusha is very ill. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is certainly dying. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How awful! You must admit that medicine is a fraud, Karamazov,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>cried Kolya warmly.
<p/>One can see that you used to be very, very dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) ... before the incident ... with the knife...
<p/>'' Ilusha has mentioned you often, very often, even in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) sleep, in delirium, you know. Then there's another reason.... Tell me, is that your dog?''
<p/>'' Yes, Perezvon.'' <div class="bookquote">``Not Zhutchka?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha looked at Kolya with eyes full of pity. '' Is she (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) lost for ever?'' <div class="bookquote">``I know you would all like it to be Zhutchka.
<p/>That's what I came for; that's what I asked you to come out here for, to explain the whole episode to you before we go in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) began with animation.
<p/>I've heard all about it. '' Kolya smiled mysteriously. '' Listen, Karamazov, I'll tell you all about it. '' You see, Karamazov, Ilusha came into the preparatory class last spring.
<p/>Well, you know what our preparatory class is-- a lot of small boys. They began teasing Ilusha at once. I am two classes higher up, and, of course, I only look on at them from a distance.
<p/>I saw the boy was weak and small, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wouldn't give in to them; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fought with them. I saw he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was proud, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes were full of fire.
<p/>The worst of it was he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was horribly dressed at the time, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) breeches were too small for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and there were holes in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) boots.
<p/>I like children like that. And they teased him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) all the more. They worried him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) about it; they jeered at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>That I can't stand. I stood up for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) at once, and gave it to them hot. I beat them, but they adore me, do you know, Karamazov?''
<p/>Kolya boasted impulsively; <div class="bookquote">``but I am always fond of children. I've two chickens in my hands at home now--that's what detained me to-day.
<p/>I tell you that, the boy was proud; but in the end he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) became slavishly devoted to me: he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did my slightest bidding, obeyed me as though I were God, tried to copy me.
<p/>So they left off beating Ilusha and I took him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) under my protection. I saw the boy was proud. In the intervals between the classes he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) used to run to me at once, and I'd go about with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>On Sundays, too. They always laugh when an older boy makes friends with a younger one like that; but that's a prejudice.
<p/>If it's my fancy, that's enough. I am teaching him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), developing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). Why shouldn't I develop him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) if I like him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)?
<p/>I see you want to influence the younger generation--to develop them, to be of use to them, and I assure you this trait in your character, which I knew by hearsay, attracted me more than anything.
<p/>I noticed that there was a sort of softness and sentimentality coming over the boy, and you know I have a positive hatred of this sheepish sentimentality, and I have had it from a baby.
<p/>Here you, Karamazov, have taken up with all these nestlings. Let us get to the point, though. There were contradictions in him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), too
<p/>: he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was proud, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was slavishly devoted to me, and yet all at once his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes would flash and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d refuse to agree with me
<p/>I used sometimes to propound certain ideas; I could see that it was not so much that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) disagreed with the ideas, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was simply rebelling against me, because I was cool in responding to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) endearments.
<p/>; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d argue, fly into a rage. And so, in order to train him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) properly, the tenderer he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was, the colder I became.
<p/>My object was to form his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) character, to lick him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) into shape, to make a man of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ... and besides ... no doubt, you understand me at a word.
<p/>Suddenly I noticed for three days in succession he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was downcast and dejected, not because of my coldness, but for something else, something more important.
<p/>I have pumped him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and found out that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had somehow got to know Smerdyakov, who was footman to your late father--it was before his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) death, of course--and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) taught the little fool a silly trick--that is, a brutal, nasty trick.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to take a piece of bread, to stick a pin in it, and throw it to one of those hungry dogs who snap up anything without biting it, and then to watch and see what would happen.
<p/>So they prepared a piece of bread like that and threw it to Zhutchka, that shaggy dog there's been such a fuss about.
<p/>I did it on purpose: that was my idea. I wondered what the tragedy was. The people of the house it belonged to never fed it at all, though it barked all day.
<p/>So it rushed at the bread, swallowed it, and began to squeal; it turned round and round and ran away, squealing as it ran out of sight.
<p/>-LRB-Do you like that stupid barking, Karamazov? I can't stand it.-RRB- That was Ilusha's own account of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) confessed it to me, and cried bitterly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hugged me, shaking all over. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) kept on repeating ' He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ran away squealing': the sight of that haunted him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was tormented by remorse, I could see that. I took it seriously. I determined to give him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) a lesson for other things as well.
<p/>So I must confess I wasn't quite straightforward, and pretended to be more indignant perhaps than I was. ' You've done a nasty thing,' I said, `you are a scoundrel.
<p/>I won't tell of it, of course, but I shall have nothing more to do with you for a time. I'll think it over and let you know through
<p/>Smurov'--that's the boy who's just come with me; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s always ready to do anything for me--`whether I will have anything to do with you in the future or whether I give you up for good as a scoundrel.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) was tremendously upset. I must own I felt I'd gone too far as I spoke, but there was no help for it.
<p/>I did what I thought best at the time. A day or two after, I sent Smurov to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) that I would not speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) again.
<p/>Secretly I only meant to send him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) to Coventry for a few days and then, if I saw signs of repentance, to hold out my hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) again.
<p/>That's what we call it when two schoolfellows refuse to have anything more to do with one another. That was my intention.
<p/>But what do you think happened? He (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) heard Smurov's message, his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) eyes flashed. ' Tell Krassotkin from me,' he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) cried, `that I will throw bread with pins to all the dogs--all--all of them!' '
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>)'s going in for a little temper. We must smoke it out of him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>).' And I began to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) with contempt; whenever I met him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) I turned away or smiled sarcastically.
<p/>And just then that affair with his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) father happened. You remember? You must realize that he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) was fearfully worked up by what had happened already.
<p/>The boys, seeing I'd given him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) up, set on him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) and taunted him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>), shouting, `Wisp of tow, wisp of tow!' And he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) had soon regular skirmishes with them, which I am very sorry for.
<p/>They seem to have given him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) one very bad beating. One day he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) flew at them all as they were coming out of school.
<p/>And, I swear, I don't remember that I laughed; it was quite the other way, I felt awfully sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>), in another minute I would have run up to take his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) part.
<p/>I don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) fancied; but he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) pulled out a penknife, rushed at me, and struck at my thigh, here in my right leg.
<p/>I stood a few yards off, looking on. But he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) suddenly met my eyes. I didn't move. I don't mind owning I am plucky sometimes, Karamazov.
<p/>I simply looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) contemptuously, as though to say, `This is how you repay all my kindness! Do it again, if you like, I'm at your service.'
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) didn't stab me again; he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) broke down, he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) was frightened at what he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) had done, he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) threw away the knife, burst out crying, and ran away.
<p/>I did not sneak on him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>), of course, and I made them all keep quiet, so it shouldn't come to the ears of the masters.
<p/>And then I heard that the same day he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>)'d been throwing stones and had bitten your finger--but you understand now what a state he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) was in!
<p/>Well, it can't be helped: it was stupid of me not to come and forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>)--that is, to make it up with him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>)--when he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) was taken ill.
<p/>I didn't even tell my mother till it had healed up. And the wound was a mere scratch. I am sorry for it now.
<p/>But I had a special reason. So now I've told you all about it ... but I'm afraid it was stupid of me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, what a pity,'' exclaimed Alyosha, with feeling, <div class="bookquote">``that I didn't know before what terms you were on with him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>), or I'd have come to you long ago to beg you to go to him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) with me.

<p/>And you've really not succeeded in finding that dog? His (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) father and the boys have been hunting all over the town for it.
<p/>Would you believe it, since he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>)'s been ill, I've three times heard him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) repeat with tears, `It's because I killed Zhutchka, father, that I am ill now.
<p/>God is punishing me for it.' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) can't get that idea out of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head. And if the dog were found and proved to be alive, one might almost fancy the joy would cure him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>We have all rested our hopes on you.'' <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, what made you hope that I should be the one to find him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the dog</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a report that you were looking for the dog, and that you would bring it when you'd found it.
<p/>Kolya asked, with great curiosity. '' Why did you reckon on me rather than any one else?'' '' Smurov said something of the sort.
<p/>The boys brought him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) a live hare; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) just looked at it, with a faint smile, and asked them to set it free in the fields.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father has just this moment come back, bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) a mastiff pup, hoping to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with that; but I think it only makes it worse.''
<p/>We've all been trying to persuade Ilusha that the dog is alive, that it's been seen. And so we did. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, Karamazov, what sort of man is the father?
<p/>I know him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), but what do you make of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--a mountebank, a buffoon?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, no; there are people of deep feeling who have been somehow crushed.

<p/>Believe me, Krassotkin, that sort of buffoonery is sometimes tragic in the extreme. I feel almost certain of that when I look at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) now.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I understand you, Karamazov. I see you understand human nature,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>Kolya added, with feeling. '' And as soon as I saw you with a dog, I thought it was Zhutchka you were bringing.''
<p/>'' Wait a bit, Karamazov, perhaps we shall find it yet; but this is Perezvon. I'll let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) go in now and perhaps it will amuse Ilusha more than the mastiff pup.
<p/>Wait a bit, Karamazov, you will know something in a minute. But, I say, I am keeping you here!'' Kolya cried suddenly.

(<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why so?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' It's so trivial, so ordinary.''
<p/>I'll confess one weakness of mine, Karamazov, just to you, since it's our first meeting, so that you may understand my character at once.
<p/>I hate being asked my age, more than that ... and in fact ... there's a libelous story going about me, that last week I played robbers with the preparatory boys.
<p/>It's a fact that I did play with them, but it's a perfect libel to say I did it for my own amusement.
<p/>I have reasons for believing that you've heard the story; but I wasn't playing for my own amusement, it was for the sake of the children, because they couldn't think of anything to do by themselves.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are thirteen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>asked Alyosha. '' No, fourteen-- that is, I shall be fourteen very soon, in a fortnight. But they've always got some silly tale.
<p/>This is an awful town for gossip, I can tell you.'' '' But what if you had been playing for your own amusement, what's the harm?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, I say, for my own amusement! You don't play horses, do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>'' But you must look at it like this,'' said Alyosha, smiling.
<p/>Grown-up people go to the theater and there the adventures of all sorts of heroes are represented--sometimes there are robbers and battles, too--and isn't that just the same thing, in a different form, of course?
<p/>'' And young people's games of soldiers or robbers in their playtime are also art in its first stage. You know, they spring from the growing artistic instincts of the young.
<p/>And sometimes these games are much better than performances in the theater, the only difference is that people go there to look at the actors, while in these games the young people are the actors themselves.
<p/>But that's only natural. '' <div class="bookquote">``You think so? Is that your idea?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>Kolya looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) intently. '' Oh, you know, that's rather an interesting view.
<p/>When I go home, I'll think it over. I'll admit I thought I might learn something from you. I've come to learn of you, Karamazov,'' Kolya concluded, in a voice full of spontaneous feeling.
<p/>What struck him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) most was that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) treated him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) exactly like an equal and that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) just as if he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) were <div class="bookquote">``quite grown up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And I of you,'' said Alyosha, smiling and pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hand. Kolya was much pleased with Alyosha. <div class="bookquote">``I'll show you something directly, Karamazov; it's a theatrical performance, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said, laughing nervously.
<p/>'' That's why I've come. '' <div class="bookquote">``Let us go first to the people of the house, on the left. All the boys leave their coats in there, because the room is small and hot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh, I'm only coming in for a minute. I'll keep on my overcoat. Perezvon will stay here in the passage and be dead.
<p/>I'll go in first and explore, then I'll whistle to him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) when I think fit, and you'll see, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'ll dash in like mad.
<p/>Ici , Perezvon, lie down and be dead! You see how he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)'s dead. Only Smurov must not forget to open the door at the moment.
<p/>I'll arrange it all and you'll see something. '' Chapter V. By Ilusha's Bedside The room inhabited by the family of the retired captain
<p/>Several boys were sitting with Ilusha, and though all of them, like Smurov, were prepared to deny that it was Alyosha who had brought them and reconciled them with Ilusha, it was really the fact.
<p/>All the art he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had used had been to take them, one by one, to Ilusha, without <div class="bookquote">``sheepish sentimentality,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>appearing to do so casually and without design.
<p/>Snegiryov is already familiar to the reader. It was close and crowded at that moment with a number of visitors. It was a great consolation to Ilusha in his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) suffering.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was greatly touched by seeing the almost tender affection and sympathy shown him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) by these boys, who had been his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) enemies.
<p/>Krassotkin was the only one missing and his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) absence was a heavy load on Ilusha's heart. Perhaps the bitterest of all his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) bitter memories was his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) stabbing Krassotkin, who had been his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) one friend and protector.
<p/>But when Smurov hinted to Krassotkin that Alyosha wanted to come and see him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) about something, the latter cut him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) short, bidding Smurov
<p/>'' at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) knew best what to do, that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) wanted no one's advice, and that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) went to see Ilusha, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) would choose his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) own time for he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had ``his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) own reasons.
<p/>Clever little Smurov, who was the first to make it up with Ilusha, thought it was so. tell <div class="bookquote">``Karamazov ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That was a fortnight before this Sunday.
<p/>That was why Alyosha had not been to see him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had meant to. But though he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) waited, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) sent Smurov to him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) twice again.
<p/>Both times Krassotkin met him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) with a curt, impatient refusal, sending Alyosha a message not to bother him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) any more, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) came himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>), Krassotkin, would not go to Ilusha at all.
<p/>Up to the very last day, Smurov did not know that Kolya meant to go to Ilusha that morning, and only the evening before, as he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) parted from Smurov, Kolya abruptly told him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) to wait at home for him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) next morning, for he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) would go with him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) to the Snegiryovs', but warned him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) on no account to say he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was coming, as he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) wanted to drop in casually.
<p/>Smurov's fancy that Kolya would bring back the lost dog was based on the words Kolya had dropped that <div class="bookquote">``they must be asses not to find the dog, if it was alive.
<p/>Smurov obeyed. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>When Smurov, waiting for an opportunity, timidly hinted at his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) guess about the dog, Krassotkin flew into a violent rage.
<p/>I'm not such an ass as to go hunting about the town for other people's dogs when I've got a dog of my own!
<p/>'' And how can you imagine a dog could be alive after swallowing a pin? Sheepish sentimentality, that's what it is!''
<p/>For the last fortnight Ilusha had not left his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) little bed under the ikons in the corner. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had not been to school since the day he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) met Alyosha and bit his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) finger.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was taken ill the same day, though for a month afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) was sometimes able to get up and walk about the room and passage.
<p/>But latterly he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had become so weak that he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) could not move without help from his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) father. His (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) father was terribly concerned about him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>).
<p/>And often, especially after leading him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) round the room on his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) arm and putting him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) back to bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) would run to a dark corner in the passage and, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) head against the wall, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) would break into paroxysms of violent weeping, stifling his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) sobs that they might not be heard by Ilusha.
<p/>Returning to the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) would usually begin doing something to amuse and comfort his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) precious boy; he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) stories, funny anecdotes, or would mimic comic people he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) had happened to meet, even imitate the howls and cries of animals.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) even gave up drinking and was almost crazy with terror that his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) boy would die. But Ilusha could not bear to see his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) father fooling and playing the buffoon.
<p/>Though the boy tried not to show how he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) disliked it, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saw with an aching heart that his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father was an object of contempt, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was continually haunted by the memory of the <div class="bookquote">``wisp of tow''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and that <div class="bookquote">``terrible day.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Nina, Ilusha's gentle, crippled sister, did not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) father's buffoonery either -LRB-Varvara had been gone for some time past to Petersburg to study at the university-RRB-.
<p/>It was the only way she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) could be amused; all the rest of the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) was grumbling and complaining that now every one had forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>), that no one treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) with respect, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) was slighted, and so on.
<p/>But the half-imbecile mother was greatly diverted and laughed heartily when her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband began capering about or performing something. But during the last few days she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had completely changed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) began looking constantly at Ilusha's bed in the corner and seemed lost in thought. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was more silent, quieter, and, if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried quietly so as not to be heard.
<p/>The boys' visits at first only angered her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but later on their merry shouts and stories began to divert her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) liked them so much that, if the boys had given up coming, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would have felt dreary without them.
<p/>The captain noticed the change in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with mournful perplexity. When the children told some story or played a game, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) laughed and clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands.
<p/>As for the captain, the presence in his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) room of the children, who came to cheer up Ilusha, filled his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) heart from the first with ecstatic joy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) called some of them to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and kissed them. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was particularly fond of Smurov. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) even hoped that Ilusha would now get over his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) depression, and that that would hasten his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) recovery.
<p/>In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) alarm about Ilusha, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had not, till lately, felt one minute's doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) boy's ultimate recovery.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) little visitors with homage, waited upon them hand and foot; he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was ready to be their horse and even began letting them ride on his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) back, but Ilusha did not like the game and it was given up.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) began buying little things for them, gingerbread and nuts, gave them tea and cut them sandwiches. It must be noted that all this time he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had plenty of money.
<p/>And afterwards Katerina Ivanovna, learning more about their circumstances and Ilusha's illness, visited them herself, made the acquaintance of the family, and succeeded in fascinating the half- imbecile mother.
<p/>Since then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been lavish in helping them, and the captain, terror-stricken at the thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) boy might be dying, forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) pride and humbly accepted her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) assistance.
<p/>All this time Doctor Herzenstube, who was called in by Katerina Ivanovna, came punctually every other day, but little was gained by his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) visits and he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) dosed the invalid mercilessly.
<p/>But on that Sunday morning a new doctor was expected, who had come from Moscow, where he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had a great reputation.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna had sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) from Moscow at great expense, not expressly for Ilusha, but for another object of which more will be said in its place hereafter.
<p/>But, as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had come, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to see Ilusha as well, and the captain had been told to expect him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) hadn't the slightest idea that Kolya Krassotkin was coming, though he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had long wished for a visit from the boy for whom Ilusha was fretting.
<p/>At the moment when Krassotkin opened the door and came into the room, the captain and all the boys were round Ilusha's bed, looking at a tiny mastiff pup, which had only been born the day before, though the captain had bespoken it a week ago to comfort and amuse Ilusha, who was still fretting over the lost and probably dead Zhutchka.
<p/>Ilusha, who had heard three days before that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was to be presented with a puppy, not an ordinary puppy, but a pedigree mastiff -LRB-a very important point, of course-RRB-, tried from delicacy of feeling to pretend that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was pleased.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) father and the boys could not help seeing that the puppy only served to recall to his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) little heart the thought of the unhappy dog he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had killed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had taken the two hundred roubles from Katerina Ivanovna just as Alyosha had predicted he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) would. The puppy lay beside him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) feebly moving and he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), smiling sadly, stroked it with his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) thin, pale, wasted hand.
<p/>Clearly he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) liked the puppy, but ... it wasn't Zhutchka; if he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) could have had Zhutchka and the puppy, too, then he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) would have been completely happy.
<p/>Krassotkin's entrance made a general sensation; the boys moved away and stood on each side of the bed, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) could get a full view of Ilusha.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Krassotkin!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>cried one of the boys suddenly. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was the first to see him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) come in. The captain ran eagerly to meet Kolya.
<p/>'' Please come in ... you are welcome! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) said hurriedly. '' Ilusha, Mr. Krassotkin has come to see you!''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) turned first to the captain's wife sitting in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arm-chair, who was very ill-humored at the moment, and was grumbling that the boys stood between her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and Ilusha's bed and did not let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) see the new puppy.
<p/>With the greatest courtesy he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a bow, scraping his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) foot, and turning to Nina, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>), as the only other lady present, a similar bow.
<p/>But Krassotkin, shaking hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hurriedly, instantly showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) complete knowledge of the manners of good society. This polite behavior made an extremely favorable impression on the deranged lady.
<p/>There, you can see at once he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is a young man that has been well brought up,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) commented aloud, throwing up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands; <div class="bookquote">``but as for our other visitors they come in one on the top of another.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``How do you mean, mamma, one on the top of another, how is that? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>muttered the captain affectionately, though a little anxious on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) account.
<p/>'' That's how they ride in. They get on each other's shoulders in the passage and prance in like that on a respectable family.
<p/>Strange sort of visitors!'' '' But who's come in like that, mamma?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, that boy came in riding on that one's back and this one on that one's.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>Kolya was already by Ilusha's bedside. The sick boy turned visibly paler. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) raised himself in the bed and looked intently at Kolya.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had never imagined that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would see such a wasted, yellow face, such enormous, feverishly glowing eyes and such thin little hands.
<p/>Kolya had not seen his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) little friend for two months, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was overwhelmed at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) saw, with grieved surprise, Ilusha's rapid, hard breathing and dry lips.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stepped close to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), held out his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand, and almost overwhelmed, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Well, old man ... how are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) voice failed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) couldn't achieve an appearance of ease; his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face suddenly twitched and the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mouth quivered.
<p/>Ilusha smiled a pitiful little smile, still unable to utter a word. Something moved Kolya to raise his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand and pass it over Ilusha's hair.
<p/>'' Never mind! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) murmured softly to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up, or perhaps not knowing why he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said it.
<p/>For a minute they were silent again. '' Hallo, so you've got a new puppy?'' Kolya said suddenly, in a most callous voice.
<p/>A black nose, that means he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll be fierce, a good house-dog,'' Kolya observed gravely and stolidly, as if the only thing he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cared about was the puppy and its black nose.
<p/>But in reality he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) still had to do his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) utmost to control his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) feelings not to burst out crying like a child, and do what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could not control it.
<p/>'' Ye--es,'' answered Ilusha in a long whisper, gasping for breath. '' '' When it grows up, you'll have to keep it on the chain, I'm sure.''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll be a huge dog! '' cried one of the boys. '' Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) will,'' <div class="bookquote">``a mastiff,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``large,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``like this,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``as big as a calf,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>shouted several voices.
<p/>I got one like that on purpose, one of the fiercest breed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) parents are huge and very fierce, they stand as high as this from the floor...
<p/>'' As big as a calf, as a real calf,'' chimed in the captain. '' Sit down here, on Ilusha's bed, or here on the bench.
<p/>You are welcome, we've been hoping to see you a long time.... You were so kind as to come with Alexey Fyodorovitch?''
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had perhaps prepared a free-and-easy opening for the conversation on his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) way, now he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) completely lost the thread of it.
<p/>Krassotkin sat on the edge of the bed, at Ilusha's feet. '' No ... I came with Perezvon. I've got a dog now, called Perezvon.
<p/>A Slavonic name. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'s out there ... if I whistle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'ll run in. I've brought a dog, too,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) said, addressing Ilusha all at once.
<p/>'' Do you remember Zhutchka, old man? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suddenly fired the question at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Ilusha's little face quivered. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked with an agonized expression at Kolya.
<p/>Alyosha, standing at the door, frowned and signed to Kolya not to speak of Zhutchka, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not or would not notice.
<p/>'' Where ... is Zhutchka?'' Ilusha asked in a broken voice. '' Oh, well, my boy, your Zhutchka's lost and done for!''
<p/>Ilusha did not speak, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fixed an intent gaze once more on Kolya. Alyosha, catching Kolya's eye, signed to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) vigorously again, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) turned away his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes pretending not to have noticed.
<p/>'' It must have run away and died somewhere. It must have died after a meal like that,'' Kolya pronounced pitilessly, though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seemed a little breathless.
<p/>'' But I've got a dog, Perezvon ... A Slavonic name.... I've brought him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to show you.'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ilusha</b></font>)</div>said Ilusha suddenly.
<p/>'' No, no, you really must see him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ... it will amuse you. I brought him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) on purpose.... He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s the same sort of shaggy dog....
<p/>You allow me to call in my dog, madam? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) suddenly addressed Madame Snegiryov, with inexplicable excitement in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) manner.
<p/>'' I don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), I don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)!'' cried Ilusha, with a mournful break in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) voice. There was a reproachful light in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>You'd better,'' the captain started up from the chest by the wall on which he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had just sat down, <div class="bookquote">``you'd better ... another time,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) muttered, but Kolya could not be restrained.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) hurriedly shouted to Smurov, <div class="bookquote">``Open the door,''  (<font color='red'><b>Smurov</b></font>)</div>and as soon as it was open, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) blew his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) whistle. Perezvon dashed headlong into the room.
<p/>'' Jump, Perezvon, beg! Beg! '' shouted Kolya, jumping up, and the dog stood erect on its hind-legs by Ilusha's bedside.
<p/>What followed was a surprise to every one: Ilusha started, lurched violently forward, bent over Perezvon and gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), faint with suspense.
<p/>'' It's ... Zhutchka! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) cried suddenly, in a voice breaking with joy and suffering. '' And who did you think it was?
<p/>Krassotkin shouted with all his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) might, in a ringing, happy voice, and bending down he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) seized the dog and lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) up to Ilusha.
<p/>Look, old man, you see, blind of one eye and the left ear is torn, just the marks you described to me.
<p/>'' '' It was by that I found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) directly. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not belong to any one! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) explained, turning quickly to the captain, to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, to Alyosha and then again to Ilusha.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used to live in the Fedotovs' back-yard. Though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home there, they did not feed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a stray dog that had run away from the village ...
<p/>I found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).... You see, old man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't have swallowed what you gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have died, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have!
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have spat it out, since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is alive. You did not see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do it. But the pin pricked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tongue, that is why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) squealed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran away squealing and you thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d swallowed it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might well squeal, because the skin of dogs' mouths is so tender ... tenderer than in men, much tenderer!''
<p/>Kolya cried impetuously, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face glowing and radiant with delight. Ilusha could not speak. White as a sheet, he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) gazed open-mouthed at Kolya, with his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) great eyes almost starting out of his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) head.
<p/>And if Krassotkin, who had no suspicion of it, had known what a disastrous and fatal effect such a moment might have on the sick child's health, nothing would have induced him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) to play such a trick on him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>).
<p/>But Alyosha was perhaps the only person in the room who realized it. As for the captain he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) behaved like a small child.
<p/>'' Zhutchka! It's Zhutchka! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) cried in a blissful voice, <div class="bookquote">``Ilusha, this is Zhutchka, your Zhutchka! Mamma, this is Zhutchka!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was almost weeping. '' And I never guessed!'' cried Smurov regretfully. '' Bravo, Krassotkin! I said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>)'d find the dog and here he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>)'s found him (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>).
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>)'s found him (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>)! ''  (<font color='red'><b>another boy</b></font>)</div>another boy repeated gleefully. '' Krassotkin's a brick! '' cried a third voice. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>)'s a brick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>)'s a brick!
<p/>'' cried the other boys, and they began clapping. '' Wait, wait,'' Krassotkin did his (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) utmost to shout above them all.
<p/>'' I'll tell you how it happened, that's the whole point. I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>), I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) home and hid him (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) at once.
<p/>I kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) locked up at home and did not show him (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) to any one till to-day. Only Smurov has known for the last fortnight, but I assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) this dog was called Perezvon
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) did not guess. And meanwhile I taught the dog all sorts of tricks. You should only see all the things he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) can do!
<p/>I trained him (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) so as to bring you a well-trained dog, in good condition, old man, so as to be able to say to you, `See, old man, what a fine dog your Zhutchka is now!'
<p/>Haven't you a bit of meat? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll show you a trick that will make you die with laughing. A piece of meat, haven't you got any?
<p/>'' The captain ran across the passage to the landlady, where their cooking was done. Not to lose precious time, Kolya, in desperate haste, shouted to Perezvon, <div class="bookquote">``Dead!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kolya</b></font>)</div><p/>And the dog immediately turned round and lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) back with its four paws in the air. The boys laughed.
<p/>Ilusha looked on with the same suffering smile, but the person most delighted with the dog's performance was <div class="bookquote">``mamma. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the dog</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) laughed at the dog and began snapping her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) fingers and calling it, <div class="bookquote">``Perezvon, Perezvon!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the dog</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) won't move for all the shouting in the world, but if I call to him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'ll jump up in a minute.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing will make him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) get up, nothing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>Kolya cried triumphantly, proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) success. '' Ici, Perezvon! '' The dog leapt up and bounded about, whining with delight.
<p/>The captain ran back with a piece of cooked beef. <div class="bookquote">``Is it hot?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>Kolya inquired hurriedly, with a business-like air, taking the meat.
<p/>'' Dogs don't like hot things. No, it's all right. Look, everybody, look, Ilusha, look, old man; why aren't you looking?
<p/>The new trick consisted in making the dog stand motionless with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose out and putting a tempting morsel of meat just on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose.
<p/>The luckless dog had to stand without moving, with the meat on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose, as long as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master chose to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), without a movement, perhaps for half an hour.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), now I've brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept Perezvon only for a brief moment. ''
<p/>Paid for! '' cried Kolya, and the meat passed in a flash from the dog's nose to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth. The audience, of course, expressed enthusiasm and surprise.
<p/>Can you really have put off coming all this time simply to train the dog?'' exclaimed Alyosha, with an involuntary note of reproach in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice.
<p/>'' '' Simply for that!'' answered Kolya, with perfect simplicity. '' I wanted to show him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glory.'' <div class="bookquote">``Perezvon!
<p/>Perezvon,''  (<font color='red'><b>the dog</b></font>)</div>called Ilusha suddenly, snapping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thin fingers and beckoning to the dog. '' What is it? Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jump up on the bed!
<p/>Ici , Perezvon!'' Kolya slapped the bed and Perezvon darted up by Ilusha. The boy threw both arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head and Perezvon instantly licked his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cheek.
<p/>Ilusha crept close to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), stretched himself out in bed and hid his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face in the dog's shaggy coat. '' Dear, dear!'' kept exclaiming the captain.
<p/>Kolya sat down again on the edge of the bed. '' Ilusha, I can show you another trick. I've brought you a little cannon.
<p/>You remember, I told you about it before and you said how much you'd like to see it. Well, here, I've brought it to you.
<p/>Another time he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) would have waited till the sensation made by Perezvon had passed off, now he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) hurried on regardless of all consideration.
<p/>'' And Kolya hurriedly pulled out of his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) satchel the little bronze cannon. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) hurried, because he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was happy himself. ''
<p/>You are all happy now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) felt, <div class="bookquote">``so here's something to make you happier! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was perfectly enchanted himself. ''
<p/>I've been coveting this thing for a long while; it's for you, old man, it's for you. It belonged to Morozov, it was no use to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morozov</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Morozov</b></font>) had it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Morozov</b></font>) brother.
<p/>I swopped a book from father's book-case for it, A Kinsman of Mahomet or Salutary Folly , a scandalous book published in Moscow a hundred years ago, before they had any censorship.
<p/>And Morozov has a taste for such things. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morozov</b></font>) was grateful to me, too... '' Kolya held the cannon in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morozov</b></font>) hand so that all could see and admire it.
<p/>The sensation was even greater when Kolya announced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morozov</b></font>) had gunpowder too, and that it could be fired off at once <div class="bookquote">``if it won't alarm the ladies.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Ilusha raised himself, and, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Morozov</b></font>) right arm still round the dog, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morozov</b></font>) gazed enchanted at the toy. <div class="bookquote">``Mamma''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>immediately asked to look at the toy closer and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morozov</b></font>) request was granted.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morozov</b></font>) was much pleased with the little bronze cannon on wheels and began rolling it to and fro on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morozov</b></font>) lap.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Morozov</b></font>) readily gave permission for the cannon to be fired, without any idea of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Morozov</b></font>) had been asked. Kolya showed the powder and the shot.
<p/>The captain, as a military man, undertook to load it, putting in a minute quantity of powder. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked that the shot might be put off till another time.
<p/>The cannon was put on the floor, aiming towards an empty part of the room, three grains of powder were thrust into the touch-hole and a match was put to it.
<p/>A magnificent explosion followed. Mamma was startled, but at once laughed with delight. The boys gazed in speechless triumph. But the captain, looking at Ilusha, was more enchanted than any of them.
<p/>Kolya picked up the cannon and immediately presented it to Ilusha, together with the powder and the shot. '' I got it for you, for you!
<p/>I've been keeping it for you a long time,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) repeated once more in his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) delight. '' Oh, give it to me!
<p/>No, give me the cannon! '' mamma began begging like a little child. Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face showed a piteous fear that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would not get it.
<p/>Mamma, mamma,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``the cannon's yours, of course, but let Ilusha have it, because it's a present to him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), but it's just as good as yours.
<p/>Kolya was disconcerted. The captain fidgeted uneasily. ''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Ilusha will always let you play with it; it shall belong to both of you, both of you.''
<p/>No, I don't want it to belong to both of us, I want it to be mine altogether, not Ilusha's,'' persisted mamma, on the point of tears.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) turned to Krassotkin with an imploring face, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) were afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) might be offended at his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) giving his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) present to some one else.
<p/>Of course you may,'' Krassotkin assented heartily, and, taking the cannon from Ilusha, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) handed it himself to mamma with a polite bow.
<p/>'' '' Take it, mother, here, keep it!'' Ilusha cried. '' Krassotkin, may I give it to my mother? '' She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was so touched that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried.
<p/>'' Ilusha, darling, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>)'s the one who loves his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) mamma! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said tenderly, and at once began wheeling the cannon to and fro on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lap again.
<p/>'' Mamma, let me kiss your hand. '' The captain darted up to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at once and did so. '' And I never saw such a charming fellow as this nice boy,'' said the grateful lady, pointing to Krassotkin.
<p/>'' And I'll bring you as much powder as you like, Ilusha. We make the powder ourselves now. Borovikov found out how it's made--twenty-four parts of saltpeter, ten of sulphur and six of birchwood charcoal.
<p/>It's all pounded together, mixed into a paste with water and rubbed through a tammy sieve--that's how it's done.'' '' Smurov told me about your powder, only father says it's not real gunpowder,'' responded Ilusha.
<p/>'' Not real?'' Kolya flushed. '' It burns. I don't know, of course.'' '' No, I didn't mean that,'' put in the captain with a guilty face.
<p/>'' I only said that real powder is not made like that, but that's nothing, it can be made so. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know, you know best. We lighted some in a pomatum pot, it burned splendidly, it all burnt away leaving only a tiny ash.
<p/>But that was only the paste, and if you rub it through ... but of course you know best, I don't know....
<p/>And Bulkin's father thrashed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) on account of our powder, did you hear? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) turned to Ilusha. '' Yes,'' answered Ilusha.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) listened to Kolya with immense interest and enjoyment. '' We had prepared a whole bottle of it and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) used to keep it under his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father saw it. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said it might explode, and thrashed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) on the spot. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was going to make a complaint against me to the masters.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is not allowed to go about with me now, no one is allowed to go about with me now. Smurov is not allowed to either, I've got a bad name with every one.
<p/>They say I'm a `desperate character,' '' Kolya smiled scornfully. '' It all began from what happened on the railway.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, we've heard of that exploit of yours, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>cried the captain.
<p/>'' How could you lie still on the line? Is it possible you weren't the least afraid, lying there under the train?
<p/>Weren't you frightened? '' The captain was abject in his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) flattery of Kolya. '' N--not particularly,'' answered Kolya carelessly. '' What's blasted my reputation more than anything here was that cursed goose,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) said, turning again to Ilusha.
<p/>But though he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) assumed an unconcerned air as he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) talked, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) still could not control himself and was continually missing the note he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) tried to keep up.
<p/>'' Ah! I heard about the goose!'' Ilusha laughed, beaming all over. '' They told me, but I didn't understand. Did they really take you to the court?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The most stupid, trivial affair, they made a mountain of a molehill as they always do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>Kolya began carelessly. '' I was walking through the market-place here one day, just when they'd driven in the geese.
<p/>All at once a fellow, who is an errand-boy at Plotnikov's now, looked at me and said, `What are you looking at the geese for?'
<p/>I stopped and looked at them. I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was a stupid, moon-faced fellow of twenty. I am always on the side of the peasantry, you know.
<p/>I like talking to the peasants.... We've dropped behind the peasants--that's an axiom. I believe you are laughing, Karamazov?'' <div class="bookquote">``No, Heaven forbid, I am listening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha with a most good-natured air, and the sensitive Kolya was immediately reassured.
<p/>I believe in the people and am always glad to give them their due, but I am not for spoiling them, that is a sine qua non ...
<p/>'' My theory, Karamazov, is clear and simple,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hurried on again, looking pleased. '' But I was telling you about the goose.
<p/>So I turned to the fool and answered, 'I am wondering what the goose thinks about.' He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) looked at me quite stupidly, `And what does the goose think about?'
<p/>The oats are dropping out of the sack, and the goose has put its neck right under the wheel to gobble them up--do you see?'
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) asked. ' Do you see that cart full of oats?' I said. ' 'I see that quite well,' he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) said. '
<p/>Well,' said I, `if that cart were to move on a little, would it break the goose's neck or not?' '
<p/>It'd be sure to break it,' and he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) grinned all over his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) face, highly delighted. ' Come on, then,' said I, `let's try.'
<p/>And it did not take us long to arrange: he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) stood at the bridle without being noticed, and I stood on one side to direct the goose.
<p/>And the owner wasn't looking, he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) was talking to some one, so I had nothing to do, the goose thrust its head in after the oats of itself, under the cart, just under the wheel.
<p/>`Let's,' he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) said. I winked at the lad, he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) tugged at the bridle, and crack. The goose's neck was broken in half.
<p/>And, as luck would have it, all the peasants saw us at that moment and they kicked up a shindy at once. '
<p/>You did that on purpose!' ' No, not on purpose.' ' Yes, you did, on purpose!' Well, they shouted, `Take him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) to the justice of the peace!'
<p/>They took me, too. ' You were there, too,' they said, `you helped, you're known all over the market!' And, for some reason, I really am known all over the market,'' Kolya added conceitedly.
<p/>'' We all went off to the justice's, they brought the goose, too. The fellow was crying in a great funk, simply blubbering like a woman.
<p/>And the farmer kept shouting that you could kill any number of geese like that. Well, of course, there were witnesses.
<p/>The justice of the peace settled it in a minute, that the farmer was to be paid a rouble for the goose, and the fellow to have the goose.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was warned not to play such pranks again. And the fellow kept blubbering like a woman. ' It wasn't me,' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said, `it was he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) egged me on,' and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) pointed to me.
<p/>I answered with the utmost composure that I hadn't egged him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) on, that I simply stated the general proposition, had spoken hypothetically.
<p/>I'll complain to your masters of you, so that for the future you mayn't waste your time on such general propositions, instead of sitting at your books and learning your lessons.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) didn't complain to the masters, that was a joke, but the matter was noised abroad and came to the ears of the masters.
<p/>The justice of the peace smiled and was vexed with himself at once for having smiled. ' Their ears are long, you know!
<p/>The classical master, Kolbasnikov, was particularly shocked about it, but Dardanelov got me off again. But Kolbasnikov is savage with every one now like a green ass.
<p/>Did you know, Ilusha, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is just married, got a dowry of a thousand roubles, and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) bride's a regular fright of the first rank and the last degree.
<p/>The third-class fellows wrote an epigram on it: Astounding news has reached the class, Kolbasnikov has been an ass. And so on, awfully funny, I'll bring it to you later on.
<p/>I say nothing against Dardanelov, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is a learned man, there's no doubt about it. I respect men like that and it's not because he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) stood up for me.''
<p/>'' But you took him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) down about the founders of Troy!'' Smurov put in suddenly, unmistakably proud of Krassotkin at such a moment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was particularly pleased with the story of the goose. '' Did you really take him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) down? '' the captain inquired, in a flattering way.
<p/>'' On the question who founded Troy? We heard of it, Ilusha told me about it at the time.'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) knows everything, father, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) knows more than any of us!
<p/>'' put in Ilusha; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) only pretends to be like that, but really he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) is top in every subject... ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Ilusha looked at Kolya with infinite happiness.
<p/>'' Oh, that's all nonsense about Troy, a trivial matter. I consider this an unimportant question,'' said Kolya with haughty humility.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was greatly excited and that he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had talked about the goose, for instance, with too little reserve, while Alyosha had looked serious and had not said a word all the time.
<p/>And the vain boy began by degrees to have a rankling fear that Alyosha was silent because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) despised him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and thought he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was showing off before him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had by now completely recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dignity, though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was still a little uneasy. If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dared to think anything like that Kolya would--
<p/>And I know who founded Troy,'' a boy, who had not spoken before, said suddenly, to the surprise of every one.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I regard the question as quite a trivial one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) rapped out again, proudly. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was silent and seemed to be shy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a pretty boy of about eleven, called Kartashov. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was sitting near the door. Kolya looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with dignified amazement.
<p/>The fact was that the identity of the founders of Troy had become a secret for the whole school, a secret which could only be discovered by reading Smaragdov, and no one had Smaragdov but Kolya.
<p/>One day, when Kolya's back was turned, Kartashov hastily opened Smaragdov, which lay among Kolya's books, and immediately lighted on the passage relating to the foundation of Troy.
<p/>This was a good time ago, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) felt uneasy and could not bring himself to announce publicly that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) too knew who had founded Troy, afraid of what might happen and of Krassotkin's somehow putting him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) to shame over it.
<p/>But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) couldn't resist saying it. For weeks he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) had been longing to. '' Well, who did found it?'' asked Kolya, turning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) with haughty superciliousness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) saw from his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) really did know and at once made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>) mind how to take it.
<p/>Troy was founded by Teucer, Dardanus, Ilius and Tros,'' the boy rapped out at once, and in the same instant he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) blushed, blushed so, that it was painful to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>But the boys stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) for a whole minute, and then all the staring eyes turned at once and were fastened upon Kolya, who was still scanning the audacious boy with disdainful composure.
<p/>There was, so to speak, a discordant note in the general harmony. '' '' In what sense did they found it?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) deigned to comment at last. '' And what is meant by founding a city or a state? What do they do?
<p/>Did they go and each lay a brick, do you suppose? '' There was laughter. The offending boy turned from pink to crimson.
<p/>Before you talk of a historical event like the foundation of a nationality, you must first understand what you mean by it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) admonished him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in stern, incisive tones.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was silent and on the point of tears. Kolya held him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) so for a minute. '' '' But I attach no consequence to these old wives' tales
<p/>and I don't think much of universal history in general,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) added carelessly, addressing the company generally. '' Universal history? ''
<p/>the captain inquired, looking almost scared. '' Yes, universal history! It's the study of the successive follies of mankind and nothing more.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was showing off and he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) stole a glance at Alyosha; his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was the only opinion he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was afraid of there.
<p/>The only subjects I respect are mathematics and natural science,'' said Kolya. But Alyosha was still silent and still serious as before.
<p/>If Alyosha had said a word it would have stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), but Alyosha was silent and <div class="bookquote">``it might be the silence of contempt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>and that finally irritated Kolya.
<p/>'' The classical languages, too ... they are simply madness, nothing more. You seem to disagree with me again, Karamazov?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't agree,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha, with a faint smile.
<p/>The study of the classics, if you ask my opinion, is simply a police measure, that's simply why it has been introduced into our schools.
<p/>'' '' By degrees Kolya began to get breathless again. '' Latin and Greek were introduced because they are a bore and because they stupefy the intellect.
<p/>It was dull before, so what could they do to make things duller? It was senseless enough before, so what could they do to make it more senseless?
<p/>So they thought of Greek and Latin. That's my opinion , I hope I shall never change it,'' Kolya finished abruptly.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cheeks were flushed. '' That's true,'' assented Smurov suddenly, in a ringing tone of conviction. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had listened attentively. ''
<p/>And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is first in Latin himself,'' cried one of the group of boys suddenly. '' Yes, father, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) says that
<p/>and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is first in Latin,'' echoed Ilusha. '' What of it?'' Kolya thought fit to defend himself, though the praise was very sweet to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>I am fagging away at Latin because I have to, because I promised my mother to pass my examination, and I think that whatever you do, it's worth doing it well.
<p/>'' But in my soul I have a profound contempt for the classics and all that fraud.... You don't agree, Karamazov?''
<p/>Well, all the classical authors have been translated into all languages, so it was not for the sake of studying the classics they introduced Latin, but solely as a police measure, to stupefy the intelligence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why `fraud'? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha smiled again. '' So what can one call it but a fraud? '' <div class="bookquote">``Why, who taught you all this?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Alyosha, surprised at last. '' In the first place I am capable of thinking for myself without being taught.
<p/>Besides, what I said just now about the classics being translated our teacher Kolbasnikov has said to the whole of the third class.''
<p/>'' The doctor has come!'' cried Nina, who had been silent till then. A carriage belonging to Madame Hohlakov drove up to the gate.
<p/>The captain, who had been expecting the doctor all the morning, rushed headlong out to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). '' Mamma'' pulled herself together and assumed a dignified air.
<p/>Alyosha went up to Ilusha and began setting his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) pillows straight. Nina, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) invalid chair, anxiously watched him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) putting the bed tidy.
<p/>The boys hurriedly took leave. Some of them promised to come again in the evening. Kolya called Perezvon and the dog jumped off the bed.
<p/>'' I won't go away, I won't go away,'' Kolya said hastily to Ilusha. '' I'll wait in the passage and come back when the doctor's gone, I'll come back with Perezvon.
<p/>But by now the doctor had entered, an important-looking person with long, dark whiskers and a shiny, shaven chin, wearing a bearskin coat.
<p/>'' As he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) crossed the threshold he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) stopped, taken aback; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) probably fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had come to the wrong place. ''
<p/>How is this? Where am I? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) muttered, not removing his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) coat nor his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) peaked sealskin cap. The crowd, the poverty of the room, the washing hanging on a line in the corner, puzzled him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).
<p/>The captain, bent double, was bowing low before him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). '' It's here, sir, here, sir,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) muttered cringingly; <div class="bookquote">``it's here , you've come right, you were coming to us...''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The doctor looked round the room with a squeamish air once more and threw off his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) coat, displaying to all eyes the grand decoration at his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) neck.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sne-gi-ryov? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>the doctor said loudly and pompously. '' Mr. Snegiryov--is that you?'' '' That's me, sir!'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>The captain</b></font>)</div>The captain caught the fur coat in the air, and the doctor took off his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cap.
<p/>'' Where is the patient? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) asked emphatically. Chapter VI. Precocity <div class="bookquote">``What do you think the doctor will say to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div><p/>Kolya asked quickly. '' What a repulsive mug, though, hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)? I can't endure medicine!'' <div class="bookquote">``Ilusha is dying. I think that's certain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>answered Alyosha, mournfully.
<p/>'' They are rogues! Medicine's a fraud! I am glad to have made your acquaintance, though, Karamazov. I wanted to know you for a long time.
<p/>I am only sorry we meet in such sad circumstances. '' Kolya had a great inclination to say something even warmer and more demonstrative, but he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) felt ill at ease.
<p/>Alyosha noticed this, smiled, and pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) hand. '' I've long learned to respect you as a rare person,'' Kolya muttered again, faltering and uncertain.
<p/>'' I have heard you are a mystic and have been in the monastery. I know you are a mystic, but ... that hasn't put me off.
<p/>Contact with real life will cure you.... It's always so with characters like yours. '' '' What do you mean by mystic?
<p/>Cure me of what? '' Alyosha was rather astonished. '' Oh, God and all the rest of it. '' <div class="bookquote">``What, don't you believe in God?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I admit that He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is needed ... for the order of the universe and all that ... and that if there were no God He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would have to be invented,'' added Kolya, beginning to blush.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) suddenly fancied that Alyosha might think he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was trying to show off his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knowledge and to prove that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``grown up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh, I've nothing against God. Of course, God is only a hypothesis, but ... '' I haven't the slightest desire to show off my knowledge to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>),'' Kolya thought indignantly.
<p/>And all of a sudden he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt horribly annoyed. '' I must confess I can't endure entering on such discussions,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said with a final air.
<p/>'' It's possible for one who doesn't believe in God to love mankind, don't you think so? Voltaire didn't believe in God and loved mankind?
<p/>Voltaire believed in God, though not very much, I think, and I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) loved mankind very much either,'' said Alyosha quietly, gently, and quite naturally, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) were talking to some one of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own age, or even older.
<p/>'' -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``I am at it again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought to himself.-RRB- '' Kolya was particularly struck by Alyosha's apparent diffidence about his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) opinion of Voltaire.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) seemed to be leaving the question for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), little Kolya, to settle. '' Have you read Voltaire?'' Alyosha finished. ''
<p/>No, not to say read.... But I've read Candide in the Russian translation ... in an absurd, grotesque, old translation ...
<p/>-LRB-At it again! again!-RRB- '' '' And did you understand it?'' '' Oh, yes, everything.... That is ... Why do you suppose I shouldn't understand it?
<p/>There's a lot of nastiness in it, of course.... Of course I can understand that it's a philosophical novel and written to advocate an idea...
<p/>'' Kolya was getting mixed by now. '' I am a Socialist, Karamazov, I am an incurable Socialist,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) announced suddenly, apropos of nothing.
<p/>'' A Socialist?'' laughed Alyosha. '' But when have you had time to become one? Why, I thought you were only thirteen?''
<p/>In the first place I am not thirteen, but fourteen, fourteen in a fortnight,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) flushed angrily, <div class="bookquote">``and in the second place I am at a complete loss to understand what my age has to do with it?
<p/>Kolya winced. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The question is what are my convictions, not what is my age, isn't it?'' <div class="bookquote">``When you are older, you'll understand for yourself the influence of age on convictions.
<p/>I fancied, too, that you were not expressing your own ideas,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha answered serenely and modestly, but Kolya interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) hotly: <div class="bookquote">``Come, you want obedience and mysticism.
<p/>You must admit that the Christian religion, for instance, has only been of use to the rich and the powerful to keep the lower classes in slavery.
<p/>That's so, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, I know where you read that, and I am sure some one told you so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Alyosha.
<p/>'' I say, what makes you think I read it? And certainly no one told me so. I can think for myself....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was a most humane person, and if He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) were alive to-day, He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) would be found in the ranks of the revolutionists, and would perhaps play a conspicuous part....
<p/>I am not opposed to Christ, if you like. There's no doubt about that.'' '' Oh, where, where did you get that from?
<p/>What fool have you made friends with?'' exclaimed Alyosha. '' Come, the truth will out! It has so chanced that I have often talked to Mr. Rakitin, of course, but ...
<p/>old Byelinsky said that, too, so they say.'' <div class="bookquote">``Byelinsky? I don't remember. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) hasn't written that anywhere.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' If he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) didn't write it, they say he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) said it.
<p/>I heard that from a ... but never mind.'' '' And have you read Byelinsky?'' '' Well, no ... I haven't read all of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>),
<p/>but ... I read the passage about Tatyana, why she (<font color='blue'><b>Tatyana</b></font>) didn't go off with Onyegin.'' <div class="bookquote">``Didn't go off with Onyegin? Surely you don't ... understand that already?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you seem to take me for little Smurov,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>said Kolya, with a grin of irritation. '' But please don't suppose I am such a revolutionist.
<p/>I often disagree with Mr. Rakitin. Though I mention Tatyana, I am not at all for the emancipation of women. I acknowledge that women are a subject race and must obey.
<p/>Kolya, for some reason, smiled, <div class="bookquote">``And on that question at least I am quite of one mind with that pseudo-great man.
<p/>Les femmes tricottent , as Napoleon said. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>I think, too, that to leave one's own country and fly to America is mean, worse than mean--silly.
<p/>Why go to America when one may be of great service to humanity here? Now especially. There's a perfect mass of fruitful activity open to us.
<p/>That's what I answered. '' '' What do you mean? Answered whom? Has some one suggested your going to America already?''
<p/>``I must own, they've been at me to go, but I declined. That's between ourselves, of course, Karamazov; do you hear, not a word to any one.
<p/>I am not at all anxious to fall into the clutches of the secret police and take lessons at the Chain bridge.
<p/>I say this only to you. Long will you remember The house at the Chain bridge. Do you remember? It's splendid.
<p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``What if he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) should find out that I've only that one number of The Bell in father's bookcase, and haven't read any more of it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Why are you laughing? You don't suppose I am fibbing, do you? '' Kolya thought with a shudder.-RRB- '' Oh, no, I am not laughing and don't suppose for a moment that you are lying.
<p/>No, indeed, I can't suppose so, for all this, alas! is perfectly true. But tell me, have you read Pushkin-- Onyegin , for instance?...
<p/>You spoke just now of Tatyana.'' '' No, I haven't read it yet, but I want to read it. I have no prejudices, Karamazov; I want to hear both sides.
<p/>What makes you ask?'' '' Oh, nothing. '' <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, Karamazov, have you an awful contempt for me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>Kolya rapped out suddenly and drew himself up before Alyosha, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) were on drill.
<p/>'' Be so kind as to tell me, without beating about the bush.'' <div class="bookquote">``I have a contempt for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) wondering.
<p/>I am only sad that a charming nature such as yours should be perverted by all this crude nonsense before you have begun life.''
<p/>'' What for? <div class="bookquote">``Don't be anxious about my nature,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>Kolya interrupted, not without complacency. '' But it's true that I am stupidly sensitive, crudely sensitive.
<p/>You smiled just now, and I fancied you seemed to-- '' '' Oh, my smile meant something quite different. I'll tell you why I smiled.
<p/>Not long ago I read the criticism made by a German who had lived in Russia, on our students and schoolboys of to-day. '
<p/>Show a Russian schoolboy,' he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) writes, 'a map of the stars, which he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) knows nothing about, and he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) will give you back the map next day with corrections on it.'
<p/>No knowledge and unbounded conceit--that's what the German meant to say about the Russian schoolboy.'' '' Yes, that's perfectly right,'' Kolya laughed suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``exactly so!
<p/>Conceit may be, that comes from youth, that will be corrected if need be, but, on the other hand, there is an independent spirit almost from childhood, boldness of thought and conviction, and not the spirit of these sausage makers, groveling before authority....
<p/>Bravo the German! But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) did not see the good side, what do you think? But the German was right all the same.
<p/>Bravo the German! But Germans want strangling all the same. Though they are so good at science and learning they must be strangled.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div><p/>I am awfully childish sometimes, and when I am pleased about anything I can't restrain myself and am ready to talk any stuff.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Strangled, what for? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>smiled Alyosha. '' Well, perhaps I am talking nonsense, I agree. But, I say, we are chattering away here about nothing, and that doctor has been a long time in there.
<p/>But perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)'s examining the mamma and that poor crippled Nina. I liked that Nina, you know. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) whispered to me suddenly as I was coming away, `Why didn't you come before?'
<p/>And in such a voice, so reproachfully! I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) is awfully nice and pathetic. '' '' Yes, yes! Well, you'll be coming often, you will see what she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) is like.
<p/>It would do you a great deal of good to know people like that, to learn to value a great deal which you will find out from knowing these people,'' Alyosha observed warmly.
<p/>'' That would have more effect on you than anything. '' '' Oh, how I regret and blame myself for not having come sooner!''
<p/>Kolya exclaimed, with bitter feeling. '' Yes, it's a great pity. You saw for yourself how delighted the poor child was to see you.
<p/>What kept me from coming was my conceit, my egoistic vanity, and the beastly wilfullness, which I never can get rid of, though I've been struggling with it all my life.
<p/>And how he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) fretted for you to come!'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't tell me! You make it worse! But it serves me right. I see that now.
<p/>No, you have a charming nature, though it's been distorted, and I quite understand why you have had such an influence on this generous, morbidly sensitive boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha answered warmly.
<p/>I am a beast in lots of ways, Karamazov!'' '' '' And you say that to me! '' cried Kolya; <div class="bookquote">``and would you believe it,
<p/>I thought--I've thought several times since I've been here--that you despised me! If only you knew how I prize your opinion!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div><p/>Would you believe it, just now, when you were telling your story, I thought, as I watched you, that you must be very sensitive!''
<p/>'' But are you really so sensitive? At your age! '' You thought so? What an eye you've got, I say!
<p/>That was just when I was fancying you had a great contempt for me for being in such a hurry to show off, and for a moment I quite hated you for it, and began talking like a fool.
<p/>Then I fancied--just now, here--when I said that if there were no God He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would have to be invented, that I was in too great a hurry to display my knowledge, especially as I got that phrase out of a book.
<p/>I bet that was when I was talking about the goose. But I swear I wasn't showing off out of vanity, though I really don't know why.
<p/>Yes, I believe it was because I was so pleased ... though it's perfectly disgraceful for any one to be gushing
<p/>Because I was so pleased? directly they are pleased, I know that. But I am convinced now that you don't despise me; it was all my imagination.
<p/>I sometimes fancy all sorts of things, that every one is laughing at me, the whole world, and then I feel ready to overturn the whole order of things.
<p/>Oh, Karamazov, I am profoundly unhappy. '' '' And you worry every one about you,'' smiled Alyosha. '' Yes, I worry every one about me, especially my mother.
<p/>Karamazov, tell me, am I very ridiculous now?'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't think about that, don't think of it at all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Alyosha. ''
<p/>And what does ridiculous mean? Isn't every one constantly being or seeming ridiculous? Besides, nearly all clever people now are fearfully afraid of being ridiculous, and that makes them unhappy.
<p/>All I am surprised at is that you should be feeling that so early, though I've observed it for some time past, and not only in you.
<p/>The devil has taken the form of that vanity and entered into the whole generation; it's simply the devil,'' added Alyosha, without a trace of the smile that Kolya, staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), expected to see.
<p/>Nowadays the very children have begun to suffer from it. It's almost a sort of insanity. '' You are like every one else,'' said Alyosha, in conclusion, <div class="bookquote">``that is, like very many others.
<p/>Only you must not be like everybody else, that's all. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>'' Even if every one is like that?'' '' Yes, even if every one is like that.
<p/>You really are not like every one else, here you are not ashamed to confess to something bad and even ridiculous.
<p/>You be the only one not like it. And who will admit so much in these days? No one. And people have even ceased to feel the impulse to self- criticism.
<p/>Don't be like every one else, even if you are the only one.'' ``Splendid! I was not mistaken in you. You know how to console one.
<p/>Oh, how I have longed to know you, Karamazov! I've long been eager for this meeting. Can you really have thought about me, too?
<p/>Yes, I'd heard of you and had thought of you, too ... and if it's partly vanity that makes you ask, it doesn't matter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know, Karamazov, our talk has been like a declaration of love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>said Kolya, in a bashful and melting voice.
<p/>You said just now that you thought of me, too?'' '' '' '' That's not ridiculous, is it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Not at all ridiculous, and if it were, it wouldn't matter, because it's been a good thing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha smiled brightly. '' But do you know, Karamazov, you must admit that you are a little ashamed yourself, now....
<p/>I see it by your eyes. '' Kolya smiled with a sort of sly happiness. '' Why ashamed?'' '' Well, why are you blushing?''
<p/>'' It was you made me blush,'' laughed Alyosha, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) really did blush. '' Oh, well, I am a little, goodness knows why, I don't know...
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) muttered, almost embarrassed. '' Oh, how I love you and admire you at this moment just because you are rather ashamed!
<p/>Because you are just like me,'' cried Kolya, in positive ecstasy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) cheeks glowed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) eyes beamed. '' You know, Kolya, you will be very unhappy in your life,'' something made Alyosha say suddenly.
<p/>'' I know, I know. How you know it all beforehand!'' Kolya agreed at once. '' But you will bless life on the whole, all the same.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so, hurrah! You are a prophet. Oh, we shall get on together, Karamazov! Do you know, what delights me most, is that you treat me quite like an equal.
<p/>Do you know, all this last month, I've been saying to myself, `Either we shall be friends at once, for ever, or we shall part enemies to the grave!' ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But we are not equals, no, we are not, you are better! But we shall get on. '' And saying that, of course, you loved me,'' Alyosha laughed gayly.
<p/>'' I did. I loved you awfully. I've been loving and dreaming of you. And how do you know it all beforehand?
<p/>Ah, here's the doctor. Goodness! What will he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) tell us? Look at his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) face!'' Chapter VII. Ilusha The doctor came out of the room again, muffled in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) fur coat and with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cap on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) face looked almost angry and disgusted, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) were afraid of getting dirty. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cast a cursory glance round the passage, looking sternly at Alyosha and Kolya as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) did so.
<p/>Alyosha waved from the door to the coachman, and the carriage that had brought the doctor drove up. The captain darted out after the doctor, and, bowing apologetically, stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to get the last word.
<p/>The poor fellow looked utterly crushed; there was a scared look in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) eyes. '' Your Excellency, your Excellency ... is it possible?
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) still gazed imploringly at the doctor, as though a word from him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) might still change the poor boy's fate.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) began, but could not go on and clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hands in despair. '' I can't help it, I am not God!''
<p/>the doctor answered offhand, though with the customary impressiveness. '' Doctor ... your Excellency ... and will it be soon, soon?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must be prepared for anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>said the doctor in emphatic and incisive tones, and dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was about to step out to the coach.
<p/>'' Your Excellency, for Christ's sake!'' the terror-stricken captain stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) again. '' Your Excellency! but can nothing, absolutely nothing save him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) now?''
<p/>'' It's not in my hands now,'' said the doctor impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``but h'm!... ''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor h</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) stopped suddenly. '' If you could, for instance ... send ...
<p/>your patient ... at once, without delay'' -LRB-the words <div class="bookquote">``at once, without delay,''  (<font color='red'><b>patient</b></font>)</div>the doctor uttered with an almost wrathful sternness that made the captain start-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``to Syracuse, the change to the new be-ne-ficial climatic conditions might possibly effect--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>captain</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To Syracuse!''  (<font color='red'><b>captain</b></font>)</div>cried the captain, unable to grasp what was said. '' Syracuse is in Sicily,'' Kolya jerked out suddenly in explanation.
<p/>The doctor looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Sicily! your Excellency,''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>faltered the captain, <div class="bookquote">``but you've seen'' (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) spread out his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hands, indicating his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) surroundings--<div class="bookquote">``mamma and my family?''

<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Doctor, doctor! But you see! ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The captain flung wide his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) hands again despairingly, indicating the bare wooden walls of the passage.
<p/>'' Well, that's not my business,'' grinned the doctor. '' I have only told you the answer of medical science to your question as to possible treatment.
<p/>As for the rest, to my regret--'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't be afraid, apothecary, my dog won't bite you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>Kolya rapped out loudly, noticing the doctor's rather uneasy glance at Perezvon, who was standing in the doorway.
<p/>There was a wrathful note in Kolya's voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) used the word apothecary instead of doctor on purpose, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) explained afterwards, used it <div class="bookquote">``to insult him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What's that? '' The doctor flung up his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head, staring with surprise at Kolya. '' Who's this? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) addressed Alyosha, as though asking him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to explain.
<p/>'' It's Perezvon's master, don't worry about me,'' Kolya said incisively again. <div class="bookquote">``Perezvon?'' (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>-LRB-7-RRB- repeated the doctor, perplexed. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hears the bell, but where it is he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cannot tell.
<p/>Good-by, we shall meet in Syracuse. '' '' Who's this? Who's this? '' The doctor flew into a terrible rage. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is a schoolboy, doctor, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) is a mischievous boy; take no notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>),'' said Alyosha, frowning and speaking quickly.
<p/>'' Kolya, hold your tongue! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cried to Krassotkin. '' Take no notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), doctor,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) repeated, rather impatiently.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wants a thrashing, a good thrashing!'' The doctor stamped in a perfect fury. '' And you know, apothecary, my Perezvon might bite!'' said Kolya, turning pale, with quivering voice and flashing eyes.
<p/>'' Ici , Perezvon!'' <div class="bookquote">``Kolya, if you say another word, I'll have nothing more to do with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha cried peremptorily.
<p/>'' There is only one man in the world who can command Nikolay Krassotkin--this is the man''; Kolya pointed to Alyosha.
<p/>'' I obey him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), good- by!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stepped forward, opened the door, and quickly went into the inner room. Perezvon flew after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>The doctor stood still for five seconds in amazement, looking at Alyosha; then, with a curse, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) went out quickly to the carriage, repeating aloud, <div class="bookquote">``This is ... this is ...
<p/>I don't know what it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The captain darted forward to help him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) into the carriage. Alyosha followed Kolya into the room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was already by Ilusha's bedside. The sick boy was holding his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand and calling for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father. A minute later the captain, too, came back.
<p/>Ilusha faltered in violent excitement, but apparently unable to go on, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) flung his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) wasted arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) father and Kolya, uniting them in one embrace, and hugging them as tightly as he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) could.
<p/>'' Father, father, come ... we ...'' The captain suddenly began to shake with dumb sobs, and Kolya's lips and chin twitched.
<p/>Ilusha ... darling ... the doctor said ... you would be all right ... we shall be happy ... the doctor ...
<p/>'' Father, father! How sorry I am for you!'' Ilusha moaned bitterly. '' '' the captain began. '' Ah, father! I know what the new doctor said to you about me....
<p/>I saw!'' cried Ilusha, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hugged them both with all his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) strength, hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) face on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) father's shoulder.
<p/>Father, don't cry, and when I die get a good boy, another one ... choose one of them all, a good one, call him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) Ilusha and love him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) instead of me...''
<p/>But don't ever forget me, father,'' Ilusha went on, <div class="bookquote">``come to my grave ... and, father, bury me by our big stone, where we used to go for our walk, and come to me there with Krassotkin in the evening ... and Perezvon ...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ilusha</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hush, old man, you'll get well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ilusha</b></font>)</div>Krassotkin cried suddenly, in a voice that sounded angry. '' I shall expect you....
<p/>Father, father! '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) voice broke. They were all three silent, still embracing. Nina was crying quietly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) chair, and at last seeing them all crying, <div class="bookquote">``mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Nina</b></font>)</div>too, burst into tears.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ilusha! Ilusha! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) exclaimed. Krassotkin suddenly released himself from Ilusha's embrace. '' Good-by, old man, mother expects me back to dinner,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said quickly.
<p/>But after dinner I'll come back to you for the whole day, for the whole evening, and I'll tell you all sorts of things, all sorts of things.
<p/>And I'll bring Perezvon, but now I will take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with me, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will begin to howl when I am away and bother you.
<p/>'' What a pity I did not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will be dreadfully anxious.... Good-by! '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran out into the passage.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't want to cry, but in the passage he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) burst into tears. Alyosha found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crying. '' Kolya, you must be sure to keep your word and come, or he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be terribly disappointed,'' Alyosha said emphatically.
<p/>'' I will! Oh, how I curse myself for not having come before! '' muttered Kolya, crying, and no longer ashamed of it.
<p/>At that moment the captain flew out of the room, and at once closed the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) face looked frenzied, his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) lips were trembling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) stood before the two and flung up his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) arms. '' I don't want a good boy! I don't want another boy!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) muttered in a wild whisper, clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) teeth. '' If I forget thee, Jerusalem, may my tongue-- '' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) broke off with a sob and sank on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knees before the wooden bench.
<p/>Pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fists against his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) began sobbing with absurd whimpering cries, doing his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) utmost that his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cries should not be heard in the room.
<p/>Kolya ran out into the street. '' Good-by, Karamazov? Will you come yourself? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cried sharply and angrily to Alyosha.
<p/>'' I will certainly come in the evening. '' '' What was that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said about Jerusalem?... What did he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mean by that?''
<p/>If I forget thee, Jerusalem,' that is, if I forget all that is most precious to me, if I let anything take its place, then may--
<p/>'' It's from the Bible. ' '' <div class="bookquote">``I understand, that's enough! Mind you come! Ici , Perezvon! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cried with positive ferocity to the dog, and with rapid strides he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went home.
<p/>At Grushenka's Alyosha went towards the cathedral square to the widow Morozov's house to see Grushenka, who had sent Fenya to him (<font color='blue'><b>Morozov</b></font>) early in the morning with an urgent message begging him (<font color='blue'><b>Morozov</b></font>) to come.
<p/>During the two months that had passed since Mitya's arrest, Alyosha had called frequently at the widow Morozov's house, both from his (<font color='blue'><b>Morozov</b></font>) own inclination and to take messages for Mitya.
<p/>Book XI. Ivan Chapter I. Questioning Fenya, Alyosha learned that her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) mistress had been particularly distressed since the previous day. Three days after Mitya's arrest, Grushenka was taken very ill and was ill for nearly five weeks.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was very much changed--thinner and a little sallow, though she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had for the past fortnight been well enough to go out.
<p/>But to Alyosha her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) face was even more attractive than before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) liked to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) eyes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went in to her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>).
<p/>There were signs of a spiritual transformation in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>), and a steadfast, fine and humble determination that nothing could shake could be discerned in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>).
<p/>There was a small vertical line between her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) brows which gave her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) charming face a look of concentrated thought, almost austere at the first glance.
<p/>For one whole week she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was unconscious. A look of firmness and intelligent purpose had developed in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) face. There was scarcely a trace of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) former frivolity.
<p/>It seemed strange to Alyosha, too, that in spite of the calamity that had overtaken the poor girl, betrothed to a man who had been arrested for a terrible crime, almost at the instant of their betrothal, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) illness and the almost inevitable sentence hanging over Mitya, Grushenka had not yet lost her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) youthful cheerfulness.
<p/>There was a soft light in the once proud eyes, though at times they gleamed with the old vindictive fire when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was visited by one disturbing thought stronger than ever in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart.
<p/>The object of that uneasiness was the same as ever--Katerina Ivanovna, of whom Grushenka had even raved when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) lay in delirium.
<p/>Alyosha knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was fearfully jealous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>). Yet Katerina Ivanovna had not once visited Mitya in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) prison, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) might have done it whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) liked.
<p/>All this made a difficult problem for Alyosha, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was the only person to whom Grushenka opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) heart and from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was continually asking advice.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had returned from seeing Mitya half an hour before, and from the rapid movement with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) leapt up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) chair to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)
<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was unable to say anything. Full of anxiety he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) lodging. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was at home. he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had been expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) with great impatience.
<p/>A pack of cards dealt for a game of <div class="bookquote">``fools''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>lay on the table. A bed had been made up on the leather sofa on the other side and Maximov lay, half-reclining, on it.
<p/>When the homeless old man returned with Grushenka from Mokroe two months before, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had simply stayed on and was still staying with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arrived with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) in rain and sleet, sat down on the sofa, drenched and scared, and gazed mutely at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) with a timid, appealing smile.
<p/>Grushenka, who was in terrible grief and in the first stage of fever, almost forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) existence in all she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had to do the first half- hour after her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) arrival.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore a dressing- gown and a cotton nightcap, and was evidently ill and weak, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was smiling blissfully. Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) chanced to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intently
<p/>: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laughed a pitiful, helpless little laugh. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) called Fenya and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) to give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) something to eat. All that day he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat in the same place, almost without stirring.
<p/>When it got dark and the shutters were closed, Fenya asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) mistress: <div class="bookquote">``Is the gentleman going to stay the night, mistress?''
 (<font color='red'><b>mistress</b></font>)</div><p/>Questioning him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) more in detail, Grushenka learned from him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had literally nowhere to go, and that <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Kalganov, my benefactor, told me straight that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kalganov</b></font>) wouldn't receive me again and gave me five roubles.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes; make him (<font color='blue'><b>Kalganov</b></font>) a bed on the sofa,'' answered Grushenka. '' Well, God bless you, you'd better stay, then, '' Grushenka decided in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) grief, smiling compassionately at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) smile wrung the old man's heart and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips twitched with grateful tears. And so the destitute wanderer had stayed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) ever since.
<p/>Fenya and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) grandmother, the cook, did not turn him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) out, but went on serving him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) meals and making up his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) bed on the sofa.
<p/>Grushenka had grown used to him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>), and coming back from seeing Mitya -LRB-whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had begun to visit in prison before she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was really well-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would sit down and begin talking to <div class="bookquote">``Maximushka''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>about trifling matters, to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) from thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sorrow.
<p/>The old man turned out to be a good story-teller on occasions, so that at last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became necessary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not leave the house even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was ill. Grushenka saw scarcely any one else beside Alyosha, who did not come every day and never stayed long.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) old merchant lay seriously ill at this time, <div class="bookquote">``at his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) last gasp''  (<font color='red'><b>merchant</b></font>)</div>as they said in the town, and he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) did, in fact, die a week after Mitya's trial.
<p/>Three weeks before his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) death, feeling the end approaching, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sons, their wives and children, come upstairs to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) at last and bade them not leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) again.
<p/>From that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) gave strict orders to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) servants not to admit Grushenka and to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) came, <div class="bookquote">``The master wishes you long life and happiness and tells you to forget him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But Grushenka sent almost every day to inquire after him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). '' You've come at last! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) cried, flinging down the cards and joyfully greeting Alyosha, <div class="bookquote">``and Maximushka's been scaring me that perhaps you wouldn't come.
<p/>Ah, how I need you! Sit down to the table. What will you have--coffee?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha, sitting down at the table.
<p/>'' I am very hungry.'' '' That's right. Fenya, Fenya, coffee,'' cried Grushenka. '' It's been made a long time ready for you.
<p/>And bring some little pies, and mind they are hot. Do you know, we've had a storm over those pies to-day.
<p/>I took them to the prison for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and would you believe it, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) threw them back to me: he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would not eat them.
<p/>So I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>): 'I shall leave them with the warder; if you don't eat them before evening, it will be that your venomous spite is enough for you!'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>warder</b></font>) flung one of them on the floor and stamped on it. With that I went away. We quarreled again, would you believe it?
<p/>Whenever I go we quarrel. '' Grushenka said all this in one breath in her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) agitation. Maximov, feeling nervous, at once smiled and looked on the floor.
<p/>'' What did you quarrel about this time?'' asked Alyosha. '' I didn't expect it in the least. Only fancy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) is jealous of the Pole. '
<p/>Why are you keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>)?' he (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) said. ' So you've begun keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>).' He (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) is jealous, jealous of me all the time, jealous eating and sleeping!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) even took it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) head to be jealous of Kuzma last week.'' '' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) knew about the Pole before?''
<p/>'' Yes, but there it is. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) has known about him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) from the very beginning, but to-day he (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) suddenly got up and began scolding about him (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>).
<p/>I am ashamed to repeat what he (<font color='blue'><b>Kuzma</b></font>) said. Silly fellow! Rakitin went in as I came out. Perhaps Rakitin is egging him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) on.
<p/>What do you think? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) added carelessly. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) loves you, that's what it is: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) loves you so much.
<p/>And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) is particularly worried. '' <div class="bookquote">``I should think he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) might be, with the trial to-morrow.

<p/>You say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) is worried, but how worried I am! And he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) talks about the Pole! He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>)'s too silly! He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) is not jealous of Maximushka yet, anyway.''
 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>'' My wife was dreadfully jealous over me, too,'' Maximov put in his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) word. '' Jealous of you?'' Grushenka laughed in spite of herself.
<p/>'' Of whom could she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) have been jealous?'' <div class="bookquote">``Of the servant girls. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hold your tongue, Maximushka, I am in no laughing mood now; I feel angry.

<p/>I am a worthless creature,'' said Maximov, with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) voice. '' You would do better to spend your kindness on people of more use than me.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ech, every one is of use, Maximushka, and how can we tell who's of most use? If only that Pole didn't exist, Alyosha.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>)'s taken it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) head to fall ill, too, to-day. I've been to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) also. And I shall send him (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) some pies, too, on purpose.
<p/>I hadn't sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) any, but Mitya accused me of it, so now I shall send some! Ah, here's Fenya with a letter!
<p/>Pan Mussyalovitch had indeed sent an extremely long and characteristically eloquent letter in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) to lend him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) three roubles.
<p/>In the letter was enclosed a receipt for the sum, with a promise to repay it within three months, signed by Pan Vrublevsky as well.
<p/>Yes, it's from the Poles--begging again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>Grushenka had received many such letters, accompanied by such receipts, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) former lover during the fortnight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) convalescence.
<p/>The first letter Grushenka got from them was a long one, written on large notepaper and with a big family crest on the seal.
<p/>It was so obscure and rhetorical that Grushenka put it down before she (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) had read half, unable to make head or tail of it.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) knew that the two Poles had been to ask after her (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) health during her (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) illness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) could not attend to letters then.
<p/>The first letter was followed next day by another in which Pan Mussyalovitch begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) for a loan of two thousand roubles for a very short period.
<p/>A whole series of letters had followed--one every day--all as pompous and rhetorical, but the loan asked for, gradually diminishing, dropped to a hundred roubles, then to twenty-five, to ten, and finally Grushenka received a letter in which both the Poles begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) for only one rouble and included a receipt signed by both.
<p/>Grushenka left that letter, too, unanswered. Then Grushenka suddenly felt sorry for them, and at dusk she (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) went round herself to their lodging.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) found the two Poles in great poverty, almost destitution, without food or fuel, without cigarettes, in debt to their landlady.
<p/>The two hundred roubles they had carried off from Mitya at Mokroe had soon disappeared. But Grushenka was surprised at their meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) with arrogant dignity and self-assertion, with the greatest punctilio and pompous speeches.
<p/>Grushenka simply laughed, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) former admirer ten roubles. Then, laughing, she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) told Mitya of it and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was not in the least jealous.
<p/>But ever since, the Poles had attached themselves to Grushenka and bombarded her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) daily with requests for money and she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) had always sent them small sums.
<p/>Like a fool, I went round to him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) just for a minute, on the way to see Mitya, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is ill, too, my Pole,'' Grushenka began again with nervous haste.
<p/>And now that day Mitya had taken it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head to be fearfully jealous. '' '' I was laughing, telling Mitya about it. '
<p/>Fancy,' I said, `my Pole had the happy thought to sing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) old songs to me to the guitar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) thought I would be touched and marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)!'
<p/>Mitya leapt up swearing.... So, there, I'll send them the pies! Fenya, is it that little girl they've sent? Here, give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) three roubles and pack a dozen pies up in a paper and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to take them.
<p/>And you, Alyosha, be sure to tell Mitya that I did send them the pies. '' <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) for anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha, smiling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ech! You think he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is unhappy about it. Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s jealous on purpose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) doesn't care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>said Grushenka bitterly. '' On purpose?'' queried Alyosha.
<p/>'' I tell you you are silly, Alyosha. You know nothing about it, with all your cleverness. I am not offended that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is jealous of a girl like me.
<p/>I would be offended if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) were not jealous. I am like that. I am not offended at jealousy. I have a fierce heart, too.
<p/>I can be jealous myself. Only what offends me is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) doesn't love me at all. I tell you he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is jealous now on purpose .
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) began talking to me just now of that woman, of Katerina, saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) was this and that, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) had ordered a doctor from Moscow for him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), to try and save him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>); how she (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) had ordered the best counsel, the most learned one, too.
<p/>Am I blind? Don't I see? So he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>)'ll praise her (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) to my face, more shame to him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>)!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>)'s treated me badly himself, so he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) attacked me, to make out I am in fault first and to throw it all on me. '
<p/>You were with your Pole before me, so I can't be blamed for Katerina,' that's what it amounts to. He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) wants to throw the whole blame on me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) attacked me on purpose, on purpose, I tell you, but I'll-- '' Grushenka could not finish saying what she (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) would do.
<p/>Well, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) loves her (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) or not, I'll soon find out for myself,'' said Grushenka, with a menacing note in her (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) voice, taking the handkerchief from her (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) eyes in her (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) handkerchief and sobbed violently. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) doesn't love Katerina Ivanovna,'' said Alyosha firmly. '' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) face was distorted.
<p/>Alyosha saw sorrowfully that from being mild and serene, it had become sullen and spiteful. '' Enough of this foolishness,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said suddenly; <div class="bookquote">``it's not for that I sent for you.
<p/>Alyosha, darling, to-morrow--what will happen to-morrow? That's what worries me! And it's only me it worries! I look at every one and no one is thinking of it.
<p/>No one cares about it. Are you thinking about it even? To-morrow he (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>)'ll be tried, you know. Tell me, how will he (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) be tried?
<p/>You know it's the valet, the valet killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>)! Good heavens! Can they condemn him (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) in place of the valet and will no one stand up for him (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>)?

'' Oh, dear! couldn't you go to that counsel yourself and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) the whole thing by yourself?

<p/>Fetyukovitch agreed to come more for the glory of the thing, because the case has become so notorious. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) yesterday.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well? Did you talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>)?'' Grushenka put in eagerly. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) listened and said nothing.

 (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As an expert. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Yes; but that would be the truth if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)!'' cried Grushenka. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was mad then, perfectly mad, and that was my fault, wretch that I am!
<p/>But, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) didn't do it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) didn't do it! And they are all against him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), the whole town. Even Fenya's evidence went to prove he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had done it.
<p/>And the people at the shop, and that official, and at the tavern, too, before, people had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) say so!
<p/>They are all, all against him (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>), all crying out against him (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>). '' '' Yes, there's a fearful accumulation of evidence,'' Alyosha observed grimly.
<p/>'' And Grigory--Grigory Vassilyevitch--sticks to his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) story that the door was open, persists that he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) saw it--there's no shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>). I went and talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) myself.
<p/>And as for Mitya's being mad, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) certainly seems like it now,'' Grushenka began with a peculiarly anxious and mysterious air.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s rude about it, too. '' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, that's perhaps the strongest evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha.

<p/>I go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) every day and simply wonder at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). Tell me, now, what do you suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s always talking about?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) talks and talks and I can make nothing of it. I fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was talking of something intellectual that I couldn't understand in my foolishness.
<p/>Only he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) suddenly began talking to me about a babe--that is, about some child. ' Why is the babe poor?' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said. '
<p/>It's for that babe I am going to Siberia now. I am not a murderer, but I must go to Siberia!'
<p/>What that meant, what babe, I couldn't tell for the life of me. Only I cried when he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) said it, because he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) said it so nicely.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) cried himself, and I cried, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) suddenly kissed me and made the sign of the cross over me. What did it mean, Alyosha, tell me?

<p/>'' Ivan's going? Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) been to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)? Mitya told me himself that Ivan hasn't been once.'' '' There ... there!
<p/>What a girl I am! Blurting things out! '' exclaimed Grushenka, confused and suddenly blushing. '' Stay, Alyosha, hush! Since I've said so much I'll tell the whole truth--he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s been to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) twice, the first directly he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) arrived.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) galloped here from Moscow at once, of course, before I was taken ill; and the second time was a week ago.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) told Mitya not to tell you about it, under any circumstances; and not to tell any one, in fact. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) came secretly.
<p/>'' Alyosha sat plunged in thought, considering something. The news evidently impressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). '' Ivan doesn't talk to me of Mitya's case,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said slowly.
<p/>And whenever I go to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) seems vexed at my coming, so I've not been to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) for the last three weeks.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s said very little to me these last two months. H'm! ... if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was there a week ago ... there certainly has been a change in Mitya this week.''
<p/>'' There has been a change,'' Grushenka assented quickly. '' They have a secret, they have a secret! Mitya told me himself there was a secret, and such a secret that Mitya can't rest.
<p/>Before then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was cheerful--and, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is cheerful now--but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head like that, you know, and strides about the room and keeps pulling at the hair on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) right temple with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) right hand, I know there is something on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mind worrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)....

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is planning to throw me over, that's the whole secret. They've planned it together, the three of them--Mitya, Katerina, and Ivan Fyodorovitch.
<p/>A week ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) suddenly told me that Ivan was in love with Katerina, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) often goes to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>).

<p/>You wait, I'll make it hot for Katerina at the trial! I'll just say a word then ... I'll tell everything then!''
<p/>And again she (<font color='blue'><b>Katerina</b></font>) cried bitterly. '' This I can tell you for certain, Grushenka,'' Alyosha said, getting up. '' First, that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) loves you, loves you more than any one in the world, and you only, believe me.
<p/>The second thing is that I don't want to worm his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) secret out of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), but if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'ll tell me of himself to- day, I shall tell him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) straight out that I have promised to tell you.
<p/>Only ... I fancy ... Katerina Ivanovna has nothing to do with it, and that the secret is about something else.
<p/>I know. I do know. Then I'll come to you to-day, and tell you. That's certain. It isn't likely it's about Katerina Ivanovna, it seems to me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) put little faith in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) consolation, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was better for having had her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sorrow out, for having spoken of it.
<p/>Good-by for now. '' Alyosha shook hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>). Grushenka was still crying. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was sorry to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) in such a state of mind, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was in haste.
<p/>The first of these things was at the house of Madame Hohlakov, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hurried there to get it over as quickly as possible and not be too late for Mitya.
<p/>Madame Hohlakov had been slightly ailing for the last three weeks: her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) foot had for some reason swollen up, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was not in bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) lay all day
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had a great many things to do still. Chapter II. The Injured Foot half-reclining on the couch in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) boudoir, in a fascinating but decorous déshabillé .
<p/>Alyosha had once noted with innocent amusement that, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) illness, Madame Hohlakov had begun to be rather dressy--top-knots, ribbons, loose wrappers, had made their appearance, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had an inkling of the reason, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) dismissed such ideas from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) mind as frivolous.
<p/>Alyosha had not called for four days and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was in haste to go straight to Lise, as it was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>)
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had to speak, for Lise had sent a maid to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) the previous day, specially asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``about something very important,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>a request which, for certain reasons, had interest for Alyosha.
<p/>But while the maid went to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) name in to Lise, Madame Hohlakov heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) arrival from some one, and immediately sent to beg him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``just for one minute.
<p/>Alyosha reflected that it was better to accede to the mamma's request, or else she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) would be sending down to Lise's room every minute that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was there.
<p/>During the last two months the young official, Perhotin, had become a regular visitor at the house. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Madame Hohlakov was lying on a couch.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) was particularly smartly dressed and was evidently in a state of extreme nervous excitement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) greeted Alyosha with cries of rapture.
<p/>'' It's ages, ages, perfect ages since I've seen you! It's a whole week--only think of it! Ah, but you were here only four days ago, on Wednesday.
<p/>You have come to see Lise. I'm sure you meant to slip into her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) room on tiptoe, without my hearing you.
<p/>My dear, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, if you only knew how worried I am about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>)! But of that later, though that's the most important thing, of that later.
<p/>Dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, I trust you implicitly with my Lise. Since the death of Father Zossima--God rest his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul! '' -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) crossed herself-RRB---<div class="bookquote">``I look upon you as a monk, though you look charming in your new suit.
<p/>Forgive me for sometimes calling you Alyosha; an old woman like me may take liberties,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) smiled coquettishly; <div class="bookquote">``but that will do later, too.
<p/>Where did you find such a tailor in these parts? No, no, that's not the chief thing--of that later. The important thing is that I shouldn't forget what is important.
<p/>Please remind me of it yourself. As soon as my tongue runs away with me, you just say `the important thing?'
<p/>Ever since Lise took back her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) promise--her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) childish promise, Alexey Fyodorovitch--to marry you, you've realized, of course, that it was only the playful fancy of a sick child who had been so long confined to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) chair--thank God, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) can walk now!... that new doctor Katya sent for from Moscow for your unhappy brother, who will to-morrow--

<p/>Ready to die of curiosity.... That doctor was with us yesterday and saw Lise.... I paid him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) fifty roubles for the visit.
<p/>But that's not the point, that's not the point again. You see, I'm mixing everything up. I am in such a hurry.
<p/>Why am I in a hurry? I don't understand. It's awful how I seem growing unable to understand anything. Everything seems mixed up in a sort of tangle.
<p/>I am afraid you are so bored you will jump up and run away, and that will be all I shall see of you.
<p/>Goodness! Why are we sitting here and no coffee? Yulia, Glafira, coffee! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Alyosha made haste to thank her (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>), and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alyosha</b></font>) had only just had coffee.

<p/>Hush, hush, Alexey Fyodorovitch, for I have so much to say to you that I am afraid I shall tell you nothing.
<p/>What use is it now? This awful trial ... I shall certainly go, I am making arrangements. I shall be carried there in my chair; besides I can sit up.
<p/>I shall have people with me. And, you know, I am a witness. How shall I speak , how shall I speak?

<p/>Well, so be it! I am weary. This Katya, cette charmante personne , has disappointed all my hopes. It drives me out of my mind.
<p/>Worst of all--the publicity. The story has been told a million times over in all the papers in Moscow and Petersburg.
<p/>Ah! yes, would you believe it , there's a paragraph that I was 'a dear friend' of your brother's --, I can't repeat the horrid word.

<p/>I am awfully fond of gossip, and I take it in, and now it pays me out--this is what gossip comes to!
<p/>Here, in the Petersburg paper Gossip . The paper began coming out this year. Here it is, here, this passage. Read it.
<p/>It was not exactly that she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was upset, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) seemed overwhelmed and perhaps everything really was mixed up in a tangle in her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) head.
<p/>The paragraph was very typical, and must have been a great shock to her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), but, fortunately perhaps, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was unable to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) mind fixed on any one subject at that moment, and so might race off in a minute to something else and quite forget the newspaper.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) handed Alyosha a sheet of newspaper which had been under her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) pillow. Alyosha was well aware that the story of the terrible case had spread all over Russia.
<p/>what wild rumors about his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) brother, about the Karamazovs, and about himself he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had read in the course of those two months, among other equally credible items!
<p/>One paper had even stated that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had gone into a monastery and become a monk, in horror at his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) brother's crime.
<p/>Another contradicted this, and stated that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) elder, Father Zossima, had broken into the monastery chest and <div class="bookquote">``made tracks from the monastery.
<p/>And, good heavens! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Zossima/Father Zossima/Father</b></font>)</div>The present paragraph in the paper Gossip was under the heading, <div class="bookquote">``The Karamazov Case at Skotoprigonyevsk. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gossip</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-That, alas! was the name of our little town. I had hitherto kept it concealed.-RRB- It was brief, and Madame Hohlakov was not directly mentioned in it.
<p/>It was merely stated that the criminal, whose approaching trial was making such a sensation--retired army captain, an idle swaggerer, and reactionary bully--was continually involved in amorous intrigues, and particularly popular with certain ladies <div class="bookquote">``who were pining in solitude.
<p/>One such lady, a pining widow, who tried to seem young though she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had a grown-up daughter, was so fascinated by him (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>) that only two hours before the crime she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) offered him (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>) three thousand roubles, on condition that he (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>) would elope with her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) to the gold mines.
<p/>But the criminal, counting on escaping punishment, had preferred to murder his (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>) father to get the three thousand rather than go off to Siberia with the middle-aged charms of his (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>) pining lady.
<p/>This playful paragraph finished, of course, with an outburst of generous indignation at the wickedness of parricide and at the lately abolished institution of serfdom.
<p/>No names appeared, in fact. ''  (<font color='red'><b>ladies</b></font>)</div>Reading it with curiosity, Alyosha folded up the paper and handed it back to Madame Hohlakov.
<p/>Scarcely more than an hour before, I suggested gold mines to him (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>), and here they talk of `middle-aged charms' as though that were my motive!
<p/>'' Well, that must be me,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hurried on again. '' Of course I am meant. He (<font color='blue'><b>bully</b></font>) writes that out of spite!
<p/>God Almighty forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) for the middle-aged charms, as I forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>)! You know it's-- Do you know who it is?
<p/>It's your friend Rakitin.'' <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha, <div class="bookquote">``though I've heard nothing about it.

<p/>There's no help for it, I'll confess, for there is one point in which I was perhaps to blame. Only a little, little point, so little that perhaps it doesn't count.
<p/>You see, my dear boy''--Madame Hohlakov suddenly looked arch and a charming, though enigmatic, smile played about her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) lips--<div class="bookquote">``you see, I suspect ...
<p/>You must forgive me, Alyosha. I am like a mother to you.... No, no; quite the contrary. I speak to you now as though you were my father--mother's quite out of place.
<p/>Well, it's as though I were confessing to Father Zossima, that's just it. I called you a monk just now. Well, that poor young man, your friend, Rakitin -LRB-Mercy on us!
<p/>I feel cross, but not very-RRB-, that frivolous young man, would you believe it, seems to have taken it into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head to fall in love with me.
<p/>At first--a month ago--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only began to come oftener to see me, almost every day; though, of course, we were acquainted before.
<p/>I can't be angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I only noticed it later. I knew nothing about it ... and suddenly it dawned upon me, and I began to notice things with surprise.
<p/>You know, two months ago, that modest, charming, excellent young man, Pyotr Ilyitch Perhotin, who's in the service here, began to be a regular visitor at the house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) comes once every three days, not every day -LRB-though I should be glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) every day-RRB-, and always so well dressed.
<p/>Altogether, I love young people, Alyosha, talented, modest, like you, and he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) has almost the mind of a statesman, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) talks so charmingly, and I shall certainly, certainly try and get promotion for him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>).
<p/>You met him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) here ever so many times yourself. And he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) is an excellent, earnest young man, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a future diplomat.
<p/>On that awful day he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) almost saved me from death by coming in the night. And your friend Rakitin comes in such boots, and always stretches them out on the carpet....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) began hinting at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) feelings, in fact, and one day, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was going, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) squeezed my hand terribly hard.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) had met Pyotr Ilyitch here before, and would you believe it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) is always gibing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>), growling at him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>), for some reason.
<p/>My foot began to swell directly after he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) pressed my hand like that. I simply looked at the way they went on together and laughed inwardly.
<p/>So I was sitting here alone--no , I was laid up then. Well, I was lying here alone and suddenly Rakitin comes in, and only fancy!
<p/>brought me some verses of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) own composition--a short poem, on my bad foot: that is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) described my foot in a poem.
<p/>Wait a minute--how did it go? A captivating little foot. It began somehow like that. I can never remember poetry. I've got it here.
<p/>I'll show it to you later. But it's a charming thing--charming; and, you know, it's not only about the foot , it had a good moral, too, a charming idea, only I've forgotten it
<p/>; in fact, it was just the thing for an album. So, of course, I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was evidently flattered.
<p/>I could see that Pyotr Ilyitch was in the way, for Rakitin certainly wanted to say something after giving me the verses.
<p/>I'd hardly had time to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) when in comes Pyotr Ilyitch, and Rakitin suddenly looked as black as night. I had a presentiment of it; but Pyotr Ilyitch came in.
<p/>But I am convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) guessed, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) won't own it to this day, and declares he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) had no idea.
<p/>I showed Pyotr Ilyitch the verses and didn't say who was the author. But he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) says that on purpose. Pyotr Ilyitch began to laugh at once, and fell to criticizing it. '
<p/>Wretched doggerel,' he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) said they were, `some divinity student must have written them,' and with such vehemence, such vehemence! Then, instead of laughing, your friend flew into a rage. '
<p/>Good gracious!' I thought, `they'll fly at each other.' ' It was I who wrote them,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). ' I wrote them as a joke,' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said, `for I think it degrading to write verses....
<p/>They want to put a monument to your Pushkin for writing about women's feet, while I wrote with a moral purpose, and you,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>), `are an advocate of serfdom.
<p/>You have no modern enlightened feelings, you are uninfluenced by progress, you are a mere official,' he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) said, `and you take bribes.'
<p/>But they are good poetry. You've no humane ideas,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>). ' Then I began screaming and imploring them. And, you know, Pyotr Ilyitch is anything but a coward.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) at once took up the most gentlemanly tone, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) sarcastically, listened, and apologized. ' I'd no idea,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>). '
<p/>I shouldn't have said it, if I had known. I should have praised it. Poets are all so irritable,' he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) said.
<p/>In short, he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) under cover of the most gentlemanly tone. He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) explained to me afterwards that it was all sarcastic.
<p/>Only as I lay there, just as before you now, I thought, `Would it, or would it not, be the proper thing for me to turn Rakitin out for shouting so rudely at a visitor in my house?'
<p/>And, would you believe it, I lay here, shut my eyes, and wondered, would it be the proper thing or not.
<p/>I kept worrying and worrying, and my heart began to beat, and I couldn't make up my mind whether to make an outcry or not.
<p/>I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was in earnest. One voice seemed to be telling me, `Speak,' and the other `No, don't speak.' And no sooner had the second voice said that than I cried out, and fainted.
<p/>I got up suddenly and said to Rakitin, `It's painful for me to say it, but I don't wish to see you in my house again.'
<p/>Of course, there was a fuss. So I turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) out. Ah! Alexey Fyodorovitch, I know myself I did wrong. I was putting it on.
<p/>I wasn't angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) at all, really; but I suddenly fancied-- that was what did it--that it would be such a fine scene....
<p/>And yet, believe me, it was quite natural, for I really shed tears and cried for several days afterwards, and then suddenly, one afternoon, I forgot all about it.
<p/>So it's a fortnight since he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'s been here, and I kept wondering whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) would come again. I wondered even yesterday, then suddenly last night came this Gossip .
<p/>I read it and gasped. Who could have written it? He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) must have written it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) went home, sat down, wrote it on the spot, sent it, and they put it in.
<p/>It was a fortnight ago, you see. But, Alyosha, it's awful how I keep talking and don't say what I want to say.
<p/>Ah! the words come of themselves!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Hohlakov</b></font>)</div>'' It's very important for me to be in time to see my brother to-day,'' Alyosha faltered.
<p/>'' To be sure, to be sure! You bring it all back to me. Listen, what is an aberration? '' <div class="bookquote">``What aberration?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>asked Alyosha, wondering.
<p/>'' In the legal sense. An aberration in which everything is pardonable. Whatever you do, you will be acquitted at once.
<p/>'' '' What do you mean?'' <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you. This Katya ... Ah! she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) is a charming, charming creature, only I never can make out who it is she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) is in love with.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) was with me some time ago and I couldn't get anything out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>). Especially as she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) won't talk to me except on the surface now.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) is always talking about my health and nothing else, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) takes up such a tone with me, too. I simply said to myself, `Well, so be it.
<p/>I don't care'... Oh, yes. I was talking of aberration. This doctor has come. You know a doctor has come? Of course, you know it--the one who discovers madmen.
<p/>You wrote for him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). No, it wasn't you, but Katya. It's all Katya's doing. Well, you see, a man may be sitting perfectly sane and suddenly have an aberration.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may be conscious and know what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is doing and yet be in a state of aberration. And there's no doubt that Dmitri Fyodorovitch was suffering from aberration.
<p/>They found out about aberration as soon as the law courts were reformed. It's all the good effect of the reformed law courts.
<p/>The doctor has been here and questioned me about that evening, about the gold mines. ' How did he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) seem then?'
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) asked me. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) must have been in a state of aberration. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) came in shouting, `Money, money, three thousand! Give me three thousand!'
<p/>and then went away and immediately did the murder. ' I don't want to murder him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>),' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) suddenly went and murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).
<p/>That's why they'll acquit him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) struggled against it and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) didn't murder him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>),'' Alyosha interrupted rather sharply.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) felt more and more sick with anxiety and impatience. '' Yes, I know it was that old man Grigory murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay as Dmitri Fyodorovitch struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) down, and then got up, saw the door open, went in and killed Fyodor Pavlovitch.''
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) recovered from the blow Dmitri Fyodorovitch gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) on the head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was suffering from aberration; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) went and committed the murder.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Grigory? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Alyosha. '' Yes, yes; it was Grigory. '' But why, why?'' '' Suffering from aberration. As for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) didn't, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) very likely doesn't remember.
<p/>Only, you know, it'll be better, ever so much better, if Dmitri Fyodorovitch murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>). And that's how it must have been, though I say it was Grigory.
<p/>It certainly was Dmitri Fyodorovitch, and that's better, ever so much better! Oh! not better that a son should have killed his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father, I don't defend that.
<p/>Children ought to honor their parents, and yet it would be better if it were he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), as you'd have nothing to cry over then, for he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did it when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was unconscious or rather when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was conscious, but did not know what he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was doing.
<p/>Let them acquit him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)--that's so humane, and would show what a blessing reformed law courts are. I knew nothing about it, but they say they have been so a long time.
<p/>And when I heard it yesterday, I was so struck by it that I wanted to send for you at once.
<p/>And if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is acquitted, make him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) come straight from the law courts to dinner with me, and I'll have a party of friends, and we'll drink to the reformed law courts.
<p/>I don't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)'d be dangerous; besides, I'll invite a great many friends, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could always be led out if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did anything.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might be made a justice of the peace or something in another town, for those who have been in trouble themselves make the best judges.
<p/>nowadays?--you, I, all of us are in a state of aberration, and there are ever so many examples of it: a man sits singing a song, suddenly something annoys him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes a pistol and shoots the first person he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes across, and no one blames him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for it.
<p/>And, besides, who isn't suffering from aberration I read that lately, and all the doctors confirm it. The doctors are always confirming; they confirm anything.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) made me cry again yesterday, and the day before, too, and to-day I suddenly realized that it's all due to aberration.
<p/>Why, my Lise is in a state of aberration. Oh, Lise grieves me so! I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>)'s quite mad. Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) send for you?
<p/>Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) send for you or did you come of yourself?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) sent for me, and I am just going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha got up resolutely. '' Oh, my dear, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, perhaps that's what's most important,'' Madame Hohlakov cried, suddenly bursting into tears.
<p/>God knows I trust Lise to you with all my heart, and it's no matter her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) sending for you on the sly, without telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) mother.
<p/>But forgive me, I can't trust my daughter so easily to your brother Ivan Fyodorovitch, though I still consider him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) the most chivalrous young man.
<p/>'' But only fancy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'s been to see Lise and I knew nothing about it!'' <div class="bookquote">``How? What? When? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha was exceedingly surprised.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had not sat down again and listened standing. '' I will tell you; that's perhaps why I asked you to come, for I don't know now why I did ask you to come.
<p/>Well, Ivan Fyodorovitch has been to see me twice, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) came back from Moscow. First time he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) came as a friend to call on me, and the second time Katya was here and
<p/>I didn't, of course, expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) to come often, knowing what a lot he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) has to do as it is, vous comprenez, cette affaire et la mort terrible de votre papa .
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) came because he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) heard she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) was here. But I suddenly heard he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'d been here again, not to see me but to see Lise.
<p/>That's six days ago now. He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) came, stayed five minutes, and went away. And I didn't hear of it till three days afterwards, from Glafira, so it was a great shock to me.
<p/>I sent for Lise directly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) laughed. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) thought you were asleep,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) said, `and came in to me to ask after your health.'
<p/>Would you believe it, one night, four days ago, just after you saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) last time, and had gone away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) suddenly had a fit, screaming, shrieking, hysterics!
<p/>Of course, that's how it happened. But Lise, Lise, mercy on us , how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) distresses me! Why is it I never have hysterics?
<p/>Then, next day another fit, and the same thing on the third, and yesterday too, and then yesterday that aberration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) suddenly screamed out, 'I hate Ivan Fyodorovitch.
<p/>I was struck dumb at these amazing words, and answered, `On what grounds could I refuse to see such an excellent young man, a young man of such learning too, and so unfortunate?'--for all this business is a misfortune, isn't it?
<p/>I insist on your never letting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) come to the house again.' She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) suddenly burst out laughing at my words, and so rudely, you know.
<p/>Well, I was pleased; I thought I had amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) and the fits would pass off, especially as I wanted to refuse to see Ivan Fyodorovitch anyway on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) strange visits without my knowledge, and meant to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) for an explanation.
<p/>But early this morning Lise waked up and flew into a passion with Yulia and, would you believe it, slapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) in the face.
<p/>That's monstrous; I am always polite to my servants. And an hour later she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) was hugging Yulia's feet and kissing them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) sent a message to me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) wasn't coming to me at all, and would never come and see me again, and when I dragged myself down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) rushed to kiss me, crying, and
<p/>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) kissed me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) pushed me out of the room without saying a word, so I couldn't find out what was the matter.
<p/>Now, dear Alexey Fyodorovitch, I rest all my hopes on you, and, of course, my whole life is in your hands.
<p/>I simply beg you to go to Lise and find out everything from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>), as you alone can, and come back and tell me--me, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) mother, for you understand it will be the death of me, simply the death of me, if this goes on, or else I shall run away.
<p/>I can stand no more. I have patience; but I may lose patience, and then ... then something awful will happen.
<p/>Ah, dear me! At last, Pyotr Ilyitch!'' cried Madame Hohlakov, beaming all over as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) saw Perhotin enter the room. ''
<p/>You are late, you are late! Well, sit down, speak, put us out of suspense. What does the counsel say. Where are you off to, Alexey Fyodorovitch?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To Lise.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, yes. You won't forget, you won't forget what I asked you? It's a question of life and death!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, I won't forget, if I can ... but I am so late,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>muttered Alyosha, beating a hasty retreat. ''
<p/>No, be sure, be sure to come in; don't say `If you can.' I shall die if you don't,'' Madame Hohlakov called after him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), but Alyosha had already left the room.
<p/>A Little Demon Going in to Lise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) half reclining in the invalid-chair, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) had been wheeled when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) was unable to walk.
<p/>Chapter III. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) did not move to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>), but her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) sharp, keen eyes were simply riveted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) face. There was a feverish look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) eyes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) face was pale and yellow.
<p/>Alyosha was amazed at the change that had taken place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) in three days. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) was positively thinner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) did not hold out her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) touched the thin, long fingers which lay motionless on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) dress, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Demon</b></font>) sat down facing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>), without a word.
<p/>I know you are in a hurry to get to the prison,'' Lise said curtly, <div class="bookquote">``and mamma's kept you there for hours
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Lise/LISE</b></font>)</div>; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>)'s just been telling you about me and Yulia. '' <div class="bookquote">``How do you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>asked Alyosha. '' I've been listening.
<p/>Why do you stare at me? I want to listen and I do listen, there's no harm in that. I don't apologize.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You are upset about something?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary, I am very happy. I've only just been reflecting for the thirtieth time
<p/>what a good thing it is I refused you and shall not be your wife. You are not fit to be a husband.
<p/>If I were to marry you and give you a note to take to the man I loved after you, you'd take it and be sure to give it to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and bring an answer back, too.
<p/>If you were forty, you would still go on taking my love-letters for me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) suddenly laughed. '' There is something spiteful and yet open-hearted about you,'' Alyosha smiled to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>'' The open-heartedness consists in my not being ashamed of myself with you. What's more, I don't want to feel ashamed with you, just with you.
<p/>Alyosha, why is it I don't respect you? I am very fond of you, but I don't respect you. If I respected you, I shouldn't talk to you without shame, should I?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' But do you believe that I am not ashamed with you?'' '' No, I don't believe it. '' Lise laughed nervously again; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) spoke rapidly.
<p/>'' I sent your brother, Dmitri Fyodorovitch, some sweets in prison. Alyosha, you know, you are quite pretty! I shall love you awfully for having so quickly allowed me not to love you.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why did you send for me to-day, Lise?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wanted to tell you of a longing I have. I should like some one to torture me, marry me and then torture me, deceive me and go away.
<p/>I don't want to be happy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are in love with disorder?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I want disorder. I keep wanting to set fire to the house.
<p/>I keep imagining how I'll creep up and set fire to the house on the sly; it must be on the sly.
<p/>They'll try to put it out, but it'll go on burning. And I shall know and say nothing. Ah, what silliness!
<p/>And how bored I am! ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) waved her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand with a look of repulsion. '' It's your luxurious life,'' said Alyosha, softly.
<p/>'' Is it better, then, to be poor?'' '' Yes, it is better.'' '' That's what your monk taught you. That's not true.
<p/>Let me be rich and all the rest poor, I'll eat sweets and drink cream and not give any to any one else.
<p/>Ach, don't speak, don't say anything,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand at him (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>), though Alyosha had not opened his (<font color='blue'><b>monk</b></font>) mouth. '' You've told me all that before, I know it all by heart.
<p/>If I am ever poor, I shall murder somebody, and even if I am rich, I may murder some one, perhaps--why do nothing!
<p/>It bores me. But do you know, I should like to reap, cut the rye? I'll marry you, and you shall become a peasant, a real peasant; we'll keep a colt, shall we?
<p/>Do you know Kalganov?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>) is always wandering about, dreaming. He (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>) says, `Why live in real life? It's better to dream.
<p/>One can dream the most delightful things, but real life is a bore.' But he (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>)'ll be married soon for all that; he (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>)'s been making love to me already.
<p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>)'s just like a top: he (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>) wants to be wound up and set spinning and then to be lashed, lashed, lashed with a whip.
<p/>Can you spin tops?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' If I marry him (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>), I'll keep him (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>) spinning all his (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>) life. You are not ashamed to be with me?''
<p/>'' No.'' <div class="bookquote">``You are awfully cross, because I don't talk about holy things. I don't want to be holy. What will they do to one in the next world for the greatest sin?
<p/>You must know all about that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``God will censure you.

<p/>I would go up and they would censure me, and I would burst out laughing in their faces. I should dreadfully like to set fire to the house, Alyosha, to our house; you still don't believe me?''
<p/>There are children of twelve years old, who have a longing to set fire to something and they do set things on fire, too.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? It's a sort of disease.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' That's not true, that's not true; there may be children, but that's not what I mean.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You take evil for good; it's a passing crisis, it's the result of your illness, perhaps. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You do despise me, though!

<p/>You know, Alyosha, I sometimes think of doing a fearful lot of harm and everything bad, and I should do it for a long while on the sly and suddenly every one would find it out.
<p/>Every one will stand round and point their fingers at me and I would look at them all. That would be awfully nice.
<p/>Why would it be so nice, Alyosha?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't know. It's a craving to destroy something good or, as you say, to set fire to something.
<p/>It happens sometimes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I not only say it, I shall do it.''

<p/>And you are not lying one little bit. But perhaps you think that I am saying all this on purpose to annoy you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, I don't think that ... though perhaps there is a little desire to do that in it, too. ''
<p/>'' There is a little. I never can tell lies to you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) declared, with a strange fire in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>There was not a trace of humor or jesting in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) face now, though, in old days, fun and gayety never deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) even at her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) most <div class="bookquote">``earnest''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>moments.
<p/>What struck Alyosha above everything was her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) earnestness. '' There are moments when people love crime,'' said Alyosha thoughtfully. '' Yes, yes!
<p/>You know, it's as though people have made an agreement to lie about it and have lied about it ever since.
<p/>You have uttered my thought; they love crime, every one loves crime, they love it always, not at some `moments.' They all declare that they hate evil, but secretly they all love it.''
<p/>'' And are you still reading nasty books?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am. Mamma reads them and hides them under her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) pillow and I steal them.''

<p/>Oh, what ideas you have! '' Lise shrieked in delight. '' And you a monk, too! You wouldn't believe how I respect you, Alyosha, for never telling lies.
<p/>It's night; I am in my room with a candle and suddenly there are devils all over the place, in all the corners, under the table, and they open the doors; there's a crowd of them behind the doors and they want to come and seize me.
<p/>Oh, I must tell you a funny dream of mine. I sometimes dream of devils. And they are just coming, just seizing me.
<p/>But I suddenly cross myself and they all draw back, though they don't go away altogether , they stand at the doors and in the corners, waiting.
<p/>And suddenly I have a frightful longing to revile God aloud, and so I begin, and then they come crowding back to me, delighted, and seize me again
<p/>and I cross myself again and they all draw back. It's awful fun. it takes one's breath away.'' <div class="bookquote">``I've had the same dream, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha suddenly.
<p/>'' Really?'' cried Lise, surprised. '' I say, Alyosha, don't laugh, that's awfully important. Could two different people have the same dream?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It seems they can.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Alyosha, I tell you, it's awfully important,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lise/LISE</b></font>)</div>Lise went on, with really excessive amazement. '' It's not the dream that's important, but your having the same dream as me.
<p/>You never lie to me, don't lie now: is it true? You are not laughing?'' '' It's true. '' Lise seemed extraordinarily impressed and for half a minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) was silent.
<p/>'' Alyosha, come and see me, come and see me more often,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) said suddenly, in a supplicating voice. '' I'll always come to see you, all my life,'' answered Alyosha firmly.
<p/>'' You are the only person I can talk to, you know,'' Lise began again. '' I talk to no one but myself and you.
<p/>Only you in the whole world. And to you more readily than to myself. And I am not a bit ashamed with you, not a bit.
<p/>Alyosha, why am I not ashamed with you, not a bit? Alyosha, is it true that at Easter the Jews steal a child and kill it?''
<p/>There's a book here in which I read about the trial of a Jew, who took a child of four years old and cut off the fingers from both hands, and then crucified him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) on the wall, hammered nails into him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) and crucified him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), and afterwards, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was tried, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) said that the child died soon, within four hours.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' That was `soon'! He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) said the child moaned, kept on moaning and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) stood admiring it.
<p/>That's nice!'' <div class="bookquote">``Nice?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Nice; I sometimes imagine that it was I who crucified him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) would hang there moaning and I would sit opposite him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) eating pineapple compote .
<p/>I am awfully fond of pineapple compote . Do you like it?'' Alyosha looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) in silence. Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) pale, sallow face was suddenly contorted, her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) eyes burned.
<p/>I kept fancying how the little thing cried and moaned -LRB-a child of four years old understands, you know-RRB-, and all the while the thought of pineapple compote haunted me.
<p/>'' You know, when I read about that Jew I shook with sobs all night. In the morning I wrote a letter to a certain person, begging him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) particularly to come and see me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) came and I suddenly told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) all about the child and the pineapple compote . All about it, all , and said that it was nice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) laughed and said it really was nice. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) got up and went away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was only here five minutes.
<p/>Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) despise me? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) despise me? Tell me, tell me, Alyosha, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) despise me or not? '' She (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) sat up on the couch, with flashing eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha asked anxiously, <div class="bookquote">``did you send for that person?''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) answered, laughed, got up and went away.'' '' That person behaved honorably,'' Alyosha murmured. '' And did he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) despise me?
<p/>Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) laugh at me?'' '' No, for perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) believes in the pineapple compote himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) is very ill now, too, Lise.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) does believe in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lise/LISE</b></font>)</div>said Lise, with flashing eyes. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) doesn't despise any one,'' Alyosha went on. ''
<p/>Only he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) does not believe any one. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) doesn't believe in people, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) does despise them.'' '' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) despises me, me?''
<p/>'' You, too.'' <div class="bookquote">``Good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lise/LISE</b></font>)</div>Lise seemed to grind her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) teeth. '' When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) went out laughing, I felt that it was nice to be despised.
<p/>The child with fingers cut off is nice, and to be despised is nice... '' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) laughed in Alyosha's face, a feverish malicious laugh.
<p/>'' Do you know, Alyosha, do you know, I should like-- Alyosha, save me! '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) suddenly jumped from the couch, rushed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) and seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) with both hands.
<p/>'' Save me! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) almost groaned. '' Is there any one in the world I could tell what I've told you?
<p/>I've told you the truth, the truth. I shall kill myself, because I loathe everything! I don't want to live, because I loathe everything!
<p/>I loathe everything, everything. Alyosha, why don't you love me in the least? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) finished in a frenzy. '' But I do love you!'' answered Alyosha warmly.
<p/>'' And will you weep over me, will you?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not because I won't be your wife, but simply weep for me?''

<p/>For I don't love any one. Do you hear, not any one! On the contrary, I hate him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)! Go, Alyosha; it's time you went to your brother'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tore herself away from him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) suddenly.
<p/>'' How can I leave you like this?'' said Alyosha, almost in alarm. '' Go to your brother, the prison will be shut; go, here's your hat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with pained surprise, when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was suddenly aware of a letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) right hand, a tiny letter folded up tight and sealed.
<p/>Give my love to Mitya, go, go! '' And she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) almost forcibly pushed Alyosha out of the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) glanced at it and instantly read the address, <div class="bookquote">``To Ivan Fyodorovitch Karamazov.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) looked quickly at Lise. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) face had become almost menacing. <div class="bookquote">``Give it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>), you must give it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>)!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>), trembling and beside herself. '' To-day, at once, or I'll poison myself! That's why I sent for you.
<p/>Alyosha put the note in his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) pocket and went straight downstairs, without going back to Madame Hohlakov; forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>), in fact.
<p/>As soon as Alyosha had gone, Lise unbolted the door, opened it a little, put her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) finger in the crack and slammed the door with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) might, pinching her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) finger.
<p/>Ten seconds after, releasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) finger, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) walked softly, slowly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) chair, sat up straight in it and looked intently at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) blackened finger and at the blood that oozed from under the nail.
<p/>'' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) slammed the door quickly. The bolt clicked. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) lips were quivering and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) kept whispering rapidly to herself:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am a wretch, wretch, wretch, wretch!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Chapter IV. A Hymn And A Secret It was quite late -LRB-days are short in November-RRB- when Alyosha rang at the prison gate.
<p/>It was beginning to get dusk. But Alyosha knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) would be admitted without difficulty. Things were managed in our little town, as everywhere else.
<p/>At first, of course, on the conclusion of the preliminary inquiry, relations and a few other persons could only obtain interviews with Mitya by going through certain inevitable formalities.
<p/>So much so, that sometimes the interviews with the prisoner in the room set aside for the purpose were practically tęte-ŕ-tęte .
<p/>But later, though the formalities were not relaxed, exceptions were made for some, at least, of Mitya's visitors. These exceptions, however, were few in number; only Grushenka, Alyosha and Rakitin were treated like this.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) abuse of her (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>) at Mokroe weighed on the old man's conscience, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) learned the whole story, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) completely changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) view of her (<font color='blue'><b>persons</b></font>).
<p/>And strange to say, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was firmly persuaded of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) guilt, yet after Mitya was once in prison, the old man came to take a more and more lenient view of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>But the captain of the police, Mihail Mihailovitch, was very favorably disposed to Grushenka. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was a man of good heart, perhaps,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``who had come to grief from drinking and dissipation.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) first horror had been succeeded by pity. As for Alyosha, the police captain was very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) and had known him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) for a long time.
<p/>Rakitin, who had of late taken to coming very often to see the prisoner, was one of the most intimate acquaintances of the <div class="bookquote">``police captain's young ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>the acquaintances</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) called them, and was always hanging about their house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) gave lessons in the house of the prison superintendent, too, who, though scrupulous in the performance of his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) duties, was a kind- hearted old man.
<p/>Alyosha, again, had an intimate acquaintance of long standing with the superintendent, who was fond of talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>), generally on sacred subjects.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) respected Ivan Fyodorovitch, and stood in awe of his (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) opinion, though he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) was a great philosopher himself; <div class="bookquote">``self- taught,''  (<font color='red'><b>a philosopher</b></font>)</div>of course.
<p/>During the last year the old man had taken to studying the Apocryphal Gospels, and constantly talked over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) impressions with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) young friend.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used to come and see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the monastery and discussed for hours together with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and with the monks.
<p/>So even if Alyosha were late at the prison, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had only to go to the superintendent and everything was made easy.
<p/>But Alyosha had an irresistible attraction for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Besides, every one in the prison, down to the humblest warder, had grown used to Alyosha.
<p/>The sentry, of course, did not trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>sentry</b></font>) so long as the authorities were satisfied. When Mitya was summoned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) always went downstairs, to the place set aside for interviews.
<p/>As Alyosha entered the room he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) came upon Rakitin, who was just taking leave of Mitya. They were both talking loudly.
<p/>Mitya was laughing heartily as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) out, while Rakitin seemed grumbling. Rakitin did not like meeting Alyosha, especially of late.
<p/>Seeing Alyosha enter now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) frowned and looked away, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) were entirely absorbed in buttoning his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) big, warm, fur-trimmed overcoat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) scarcely spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>), and bowed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) stiffly. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) began looking at once for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) umbrella. '' I must mind not to forget my belongings,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) muttered, simply to say something.
<p/>'' Mind you don't forget other people's belongings,'' said Mitya, as a joke, and laughed at once at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) own wit.
<p/>You'd better give that advice to your own family, who've always been a slave-driving lot, and not to Rakitin,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) cried, suddenly trembling with anger.
<p/>Rakitin fired up instantly. '' '' What's the matter? I was joking,'' cried Mitya. '' Damn it all! They are all like that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) turned to Alyosha, nodding towards Rakitin's hurriedly retreating figure.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was sitting here, laughing and cheerful, and all at once he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) boils up like that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) didn't even nod to you.
<p/>Have you broken with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) completely? Why are you so late? I've not been simply waiting, but thirsting for you the whole morning.
<p/>But never mind. We'll make up for it now. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why does he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) come here so often? Surely you are not such great friends?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>asked Alyosha.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>), too, nodded at the door through which Rakitin had disappeared. '' Great friends with Rakitin? No, not as much as that.
<p/>Is it likely--a pig like that? He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) considers I am ... a blackguard. They can't understand a joke either, that's the worst of such people.
<p/>They never understand a joke, and their souls are dry, dry and flat; they remind me of prison walls when I was first brought here.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) is a clever fellow, very clever. Well, Alexey, it's all over with me now. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) sat down on the bench and made Alyosha sit down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>).
<p/>'' Yes, the trial's to-morrow. Are you so hopeless, brother?'' Alyosha said, with an apprehensive feeling. '' What are you talking about?'' said Mitya, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) rather uncertainly.
<p/>Till now we've been talking of things that don't matter, about this trial, but I haven't said a word to you about the chief thing.
<p/>Yes, the trial is to-morrow; but it wasn't the trial I meant, when I said it was all over with me.
<p/>'' Oh, you mean the trial! Damn it all! Why do you look at me so critically?'' '' What do you mean, Mitya?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ideas, ideas, that's all! Ethics! What is ethics?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ethics? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>asked Alyosha, wondering. '' Yes; is it a science?'' '' Yes, there is such a science ... but ...
<p/>I confess I can't explain to you what sort of science it is.'' <div class="bookquote">``Rakitin knows. Rakitin knows a lot, damn him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>)!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>)'s not going to be a monk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) means to go to Petersburg. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>)'ll go in for criticism of an elevating tendency.
<p/>Who knows, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) may be of use and make his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) own career, too. Ough! they are first-rate, these people, at making a career!
<p/>Damn ethics, I am done for, Alexey, I am, you man of God! I love you more than any one. It makes my heart yearn to look at you.
<p/>Who was Karl Bernard?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Karl Bernard? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha was surprised again. '' No, not Karl. Stay, I made a mistake. Claude Bernard.
<p/>What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>)? Chemist or what?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) must be a savant,'' answered Alyosha; <div class="bookquote">``but I confess I can't tell you much about him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>), either.
<p/>I've heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) as a savant, but what sort I don't know. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>'' Well, damn him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>), then! I don't know either,'' swore Mitya.
<p/>'' A scoundrel of some sort, most likely. They are all scoundrels. And Rakitin will make his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) way. Rakitin will get on anywhere; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) is another Bernard.
<p/>Ugh, these Bernards! They are all over the place.'' '' But what is the matter? '' Alyosha asked insistently. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) wants to write an article about me, about my case, and so begin his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) literary career.
<p/>That's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) comes for; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) said so himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) wants to prove some theory. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) wants to say `he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) couldn't help murdering his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) was corrupted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) environment,' and so on.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) explained it all to me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) is going to put in a tinge of Socialism, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) says. But there, damn the fellow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) can put in a tinge if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) likes, I don't care.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) can't bear Ivan, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) hates him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>)'s not fond of you, either. But I don't turn him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) out, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) is a clever fellow.
<p/>I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) just now, `The Karamazovs are not blackguards, but philosophers; for all true Russians are philosophers, and though you've studied, you are not a philosopher--you are a low fellow.'
<p/>Awfully conceited, though. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) laughed, so maliciously. And I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), ' De ideabus non est disputandum .' Isn't that rather good?
<p/>I can set up for being a classic, you see!'' Mitya laughed suddenly. '' Why is it all over with you?
<p/>The fact of it is ... if you take it as a whole, I am sorry to lose God--that's why it is.
<p/>You said so just now,'' Alyosha interposed. '' Why is it all over with me? H'm! ... '' '' What do you mean by `sorry to lose God'?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Imagine: inside, in the nerves, in the head--that is, these nerves are there in the brain ... -LRB-damn them!-RRB- there are sort of little tails, the little tails of those nerves, and
<p/>as soon as they begin quivering ... that is, you see, I look at something with my eyes and then they begin quivering,
<p/>those little tails ... and when they quiver, then an image appears ... it doesn't appear at once, but an instant, a second, passes ... and then something like a moment appears; that is, not a moment--devil take the moment!--but an image; that is, an object, or an action, damn it!
<p/>That's why I see and then think, because of those tails, not at all because I've got a soul, and that I am some sort of image and likeness.
<p/>All that is nonsense! Rakitin explained it all to me yesterday, brother, and it simply bowled me over. It's magnificent, Alyosha, this science!
<p/>A new man's arising--that I understand.... And yet I am sorry to lose God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>'' Well, that's a good thing, anyway,'' said Alyosha.
<p/>'' That I am sorry to lose God? It's chemistry, brother, chemistry! There's no help for it, your reverence, you must make way for chemistry.
<p/>And Rakitin does dislike God. Ough! doesn't he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) dislike Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)! That's the sore point with all of them. But they conceal it.
<p/>They tell lies. They pretend. ' Will you preach this in your reviews?' I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). ' Oh, well, if I did it openly, they won't let it through,' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) laughed. ' But what will become of men then?' I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), `without God and immortal life? All things are lawful then, they can do what they like?' `Didn't you know?'
<p/>A clever man knows his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way about, but you've put your foot in it, committing a murder, and now you are rotting in prison.'
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said laughing, 'a clever man can do what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes,' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says that to my face! A regular pig!
<p/>I used to kick such people out, but now I listen to them. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talks a lot of sense, too. Writes well.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began reading me an article last week. I copied out three lines of it. Wait a minute. Here it is.
<p/>Mitya hurriedly pulled out a piece of paper from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pocket and read: '' `In order to determine this question, it is above all essential to put one's personality in contradiction to one's reality.'
<p/>'' Do you understand that?'' '' No, I don't,'' said Alyosha. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) looked at Mitya and listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) with curiosity.
<p/>'' I don't understand either. It's dark and obscure, but intellectual. ' Every one writes like that now,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) says, `it's the effect of their environment.'
<p/>They are afraid of the environment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) writes poetry, too, the rascal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s written in honor of Madame Hohlakov's foot. Ha ha ha!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've heard about it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha. <div class="bookquote">``Have you? And have you heard the poem?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I've got it. Here it is.
<p/>I'll read it to you. You don't know-- I haven't told you--there's quite a story about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s a rascal! Three weeks ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) began to tease me. '
<p/>You've got yourself into a mess, like a fool, for the sake of three thousand, but I'm going to collar a hundred and fifty thousand.
<p/>I am going to marry a widow and buy a house in Petersburg.' And he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was courting Madame Hohlakov.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) hadn't much brains in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) youth, and now at forty she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) has lost what she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had. ' But she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)'s awfully sentimental,' he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) says; `that's how I shall get hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>).
<p/>When I marry her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>), I shall take her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) to Petersburg and there I shall start a newspaper.' And his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) mouth was simply watering, the beast, not for the widow, but for the hundred and fifty thousand.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) made me believe it. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) came to see me every day. ' She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) is coming round,' he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) declared. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was beaming with delight.
<p/>And then, all of a sudden, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was turned out of the house. Perhotin's carrying everything before him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), bravo! I could kiss the silly old noodle for turning him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) out of the house.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had written this doggerel. ' It's the first time I've soiled my hands with writing poetry,' he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) said. '
<p/>It's to win her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) heart, so it's in a good cause. When I get hold of the silly woman's fortune, I can be of great social utility.'
<p/>They have this social justification for every nasty thing they do! ' Anyway it's better than your Pushkin's poetry,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) said, `for I've managed to advocate enlightenment even in that.'
<p/>I understand what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) means about Pushkin, I quite see that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) really was a man of talent and only wrote about women's feet.
<p/>But wasn't Rakitin stuck up about his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) doggerel! The vanity of these fellows! ' On the convalescence of the swollen foot of the object of my affections'--he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) thought of that for a title.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>)'s a waggish fellow. A captivating little foot, Though swollen and red and tender! The doctors come and plasters put, But still they cannot mend her (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>).
<p/>Yet, 'tis not for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) foot I dread-- A theme for Pushkin's muse more fit-- It's not her (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) foot, it is her (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) head: I tremble for her (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) loss of wit!
<p/>For as her (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) foot swells, strange to say, Her (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) intellect is on the wane-- Oh, for some remedy I pray That may restore both foot and brain!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) is a pig, a regular pig, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>)'s very arch, the rascal! And he (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) really has put in a progressive idea.
<p/>And wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) angry when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) kicked him (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) out! He (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) was gnashing his (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) teeth!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>)'s taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) revenge already,'' said Alyosha.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>)'s written a paragraph about Madame Hohlakov. '' And Alyosha told him (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) briefly about the paragraph in Gossip . ''
<p/>That's his (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) doing, that's his (<font color='blue'><b>Pushkin</b></font>) doing!'' Mitya assented, frowning. '' That's him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)! These paragraphs ... I know ... the insulting things that have been written about Grushenka, for instance....
<p/>And about Katya, too.... H'm! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) walked across the room with a harassed air. '' Brother, I cannot stay long,'' Alyosha said, after a pause.
<p/>'' To-morrow will be a great and awful day for you, the judgment of God will be accomplished ... I am amazed at you, you walk about here, talking of
<p/>I don't know what ...'' '' No, don't be amazed at me,'' Mitya broke in warmly. '' Am I to talk of that stinking dog?
<p/>Of the murderer? We've talked enough of him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>). I don't want to say more of the stinking son of Stinking Lizaveta!
<p/>God will kill him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), you will see. Hush! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went up to Alyosha excitedly and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes glowed.
<p/>'' Rakitin wouldn't understand it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) began in a sort of exaltation; <div class="bookquote">``but you, you'll understand it all. That's why I was thirsting for you.
<p/>You see, there's so much I've been wanting to tell you for ever so long, here, within these peeling walls, but I haven't said a word about what matters most
<p/>; the moment never seems to have come. Now I can wait no longer. I must pour out my heart to you.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was hidden in me, but would never have come to the surface, if it hadn't been for this blow from heaven.
<p/>Brother, these last two months I've found in myself a new man. A new man has risen up in me. I am afraid!
<p/>I am not a bit afraid of that--it's something else I am afraid of now: that that new man may leave me.
<p/>Even there, in the mines, under-ground, I may find a human heart in another convict and murderer by my side, and I may make friends with him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>), for even there one may live and love and suffer.
<p/>One may thaw and revive a frozen heart in that convict, one may wait upon him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) for years, and at last bring up from the dark depths a lofty soul, a feeling, suffering creature; one may bring forth an angel, create a hero!
<p/>And what do I care if I spend twenty years in the mines, breaking ore with a hammer? There are so many of them, hundreds of them, and we are all to blame for them.
<p/>Why was it I dreamed of that `babe' at such a moment? ' Why is the babe so poor?' That was a sign to me at that moment.
<p/>It's for the babe I'm going. Because we are all responsible for all. For all the `babes,' for there are big children as well as little children.
<p/>All are `babes.' I go for all, because some one must go for all. I didn't kill father, but I've got to go.
<p/>I accept it. It's all come to me here, here, within these peeling walls. There are numbers of them there, hundreds of them underground, with hammers in their hands.
<p/>Oh, yes, we shall be in chains and there will be no freedom, but then, in our great sorrow, we shall rise again to joy, without which man cannot live nor God exist, for God gives joy
<p/>: it's His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) privilege--a grand one. Ah, man should be dissolved in prayer! What should I be underground there without God?
<p/>Rakitin's laughing! If they drive God from the earth, we shall shelter Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) underground. One cannot exist in prison without God; it's even more impossible than out of prison.
<p/>And then we men underground will sing from the bowels of the earth a glorious hymn to God, with Whom is joy.
<p/>Hail to God and His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) joy! I love Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mitya was almost gasping for breath as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) uttered his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wild speech.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) turned pale, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) lips quivered, and tears rolled down his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cheeks. '' Yes, life is full, there is life even underground,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) began again.
<p/>You wouldn't believe, Alexey, how I want to live now, what a thirst for existence and consciousness has sprung up in me within these peeling walls.
<p/>'' Rakitin doesn't understand that; all he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) cares about is building a house and letting flats. But I've been longing for you.
<p/>And what is suffering? I am not afraid of it, even if it were beyond reckoning. I am not afraid of it now.
<p/>And I seem to have such strength in me now, that I think I could stand anything, any suffering, only to be able to say and to repeat to myself every moment, 'I exist.'
<p/>I was afraid of it before. Do you know, perhaps I won't answer at the trial at all.... In thousands of agonies--I exist.
<p/>I'm tormented on the rack--but I exist! Though I sit alone on a pillar--I exist! I see the sun, and if I don't see the sun, I know it's there.
<p/>And there's a whole life in that, in knowing that the sun is there. Alyosha, my angel, all these philosophies are the death of me.
<p/>Damn them! Brother Ivan-- '' <div class="bookquote">``What of brother Ivan? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>interrupted Alyosha, but Mitya did not hear. '' You see, I never had any of these doubts before, but it was all hidden away in me.
<p/>It was perhaps just because ideas I did not understand were surging up in me, that I used to drink and fight and rage.
<p/>It was to stifle them in myself, to still them, to smother them. Ivan is not Rakitin, there is an idea in him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>Ivan is a sphinx and is silent; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is always silent. It's God that's worrying me. That's the only thing that's worrying me.
<p/>What if He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) doesn't exist? What if Rakitin's right--that it's an idea made up by men? Then if He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) doesn't exist, man is the chief of the earth, of the universe.
<p/>Magnificent! Only how is he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) going to be good without God? That's the question. I always come back to that. For whom is man going to love then?
<p/>To whom will he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be thankful? To whom will he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sing the hymn? Rakitin laughs. Rakitin says that one can love humanity without God.
<p/>Well, only a sniveling idiot can maintain that. I can't understand it. Life's easy for Rakitin. ' You'd better think about the extension of civic rights, or even of keeping down the price of meat.
<p/>I answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>), `Well, but you, without a God, are more likely to raise the price of meat, if it suits you, and make a rouble on every copeck.'
<p/>You will show your love for humanity more simply and directly by that, than by philosophy.' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) temper. But after all, what is goodness?
<p/>Answer me that, Alexey. Goodness is one thing with me and another with a Chinaman, so it's a relative thing. Or isn't it?
<p/>Is it not relative? A treacherous question! You won't laugh if I tell you it's kept me awake two nights. I only wonder now how people can live and think nothing about it.
<p/>Vanity! Ivan has no God. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) has an idea. It's beyond me. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is silent. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is a free-mason.
<p/>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is silent. I wanted to drink from the springs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) soul--he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was silent. But once he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) did drop a word.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) say? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha took it up quickly. '' I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), `Then everything is lawful, if it is so?'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) frowned. ' Fyodor Pavlovitch, our papa,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) said, `was a pig, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) ideas were right enough.' That was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) dropped.
<p/>That was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) said. That was going one better than Rakitin. '' '' Yes,'' Alyosha assented bitterly. '' When was he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) with you?''
<p/>'' Of that later; now I must speak of something else. I have said nothing about Ivan to you before. I put it off to the last.
<p/>When my business here is over and the verdict has been given, then I'll tell you something. I'll tell you everything.
<p/>We've something tremendous on hand.... And you shall be my judge in it. But don't begin about that now; be silent.
<p/>You talk of to-morrow, of the trial; but, would you believe it, I know nothing about it. '' <div class="bookquote">``Have you talked to the counsel?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the counsel</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What's the use of the counsel? I told him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) all about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>)'s a soft, city-bred rogue--a Bernard! But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) doesn't believe me--not a bit of it.
<p/>Only imagine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>) believes I did it. I see it. ' In that case,' I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bernard</b></font>), `why have you come to defend me?'
<p/>Hang them all! They've got a doctor down, too, want to prove I'm mad. I won't have that! Katerina Ivanovna wants to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) `duty' to the end, whatever the strain!''
<p/>Mitya smiled bitterly. '' The cat! Hard-hearted creature! She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) knows that I said of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) at Mokroe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was a woman of `great wrath.'
<p/>They repeated it. Yes, the facts against me have grown numerous as the sands of the sea. Grigory sticks to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) point.
<p/>Grigory's honest, but a fool. Many people are honest because they are fools: that's Rakitin's idea. Grigory's my enemy. And there are some people who are better as foes than friends.
<p/>I mean Katerina Ivanovna. I am afraid, oh, I am afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) will tell how she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) bowed to the ground after that four thousand.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'ll pay it back to the last farthing. I don't want her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sacrifice; they'll put me to shame at the trial.
<p/>I wonder how I can stand it. Go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), Alyosha, ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) not to speak of that in the court, can't you?
<p/>But damn it all, it doesn't matter! I shall get through somehow. I don't pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>). It's her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) own doing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) deserves what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) gets.
<p/>I shall have my own story to tell, Alexey. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) smiled bitterly again. '' Only ... only Grusha, Grusha! Good Lord!
<p/>Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) have such suffering to bear? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) exclaimed suddenly, with tears. '' Grusha's killing me; the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'s killing me, killing me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was with me just now...'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was very much grieved by you to-day.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know. Confound my temper!
<p/>It was jealousy. I was sorry , I kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was going. I didn't ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) forgiveness. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Alyosha.
<p/>Suddenly Mitya laughed almost mirthfully. '' God preserve you, my dear boy, from ever asking forgiveness for a fault from a woman you love.
<p/>From one you love especially, however greatly you may have been in fault. For a woman--devil only knows what to make of a woman!
<p/>I know something about them, anyway. But try acknowledging you are in fault to a woman. Say, 'I am sorry, forgive me,' and a shower of reproaches will follow!
<p/>Nothing will make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) forgive you simply and directly, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll humble you to the dust, bring forward things that have never happened, recall everything, forget nothing, add something of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own, and only then forgive you.
<p/>And even the best, the best of them do it. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll scrape up all the scrapings and load them on your head.
<p/>They are ready to flay you alive, I tell you, every one of them, all these angels without whom we cannot live!
<p/>I tell you plainly and openly, dear boy, every decent man ought to be under some woman's thumb. That's my conviction--not conviction, but feeling.
<p/>A man ought to be magnanimous, and it's no disgrace to a man! No disgrace to a hero, not even a Cćsar!
<p/>But don't ever beg her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pardon all the same for anything. Remember that rule given you by your brother Mitya, who's come to ruin through women.
<p/>No, I'd better make it up to Grusha somehow, without begging pardon. I worship her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), Alexey, worship her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Only she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) doesn't see it.
<p/>No, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) still thinks I don't love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) enough. And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tortures me, tortures me with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) love. The past was nothing!
<p/>In the past it was only those infernal curves of hers that tortured me, but now I've taken all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soul into my soul and through her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) I've become a man myself.
<p/>Will they marry us? If they don't, I shall die of jealousy. I imagine something every day.... What did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) say to you about me?''
<p/>Alyosha repeated all Grushenka had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that day. Mitya listened, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) repeat things, and seemed pleased. '' Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is not angry at my being jealous?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) exclaimed. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a regular woman! ' I've a fierce heart myself!' Ah, I love such fierce hearts, though I can't bear any one's being jealous of me.
<p/>I can't endure it. We shall fight. But I shall love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), I shall love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) infinitely. Will they marry us?
<p/>Do they let convicts marry? That's the question. And without her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) I can't exist... '' Mitya walked frowning across the room.
<p/>It was almost dark. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) suddenly seemed terribly worried. '' So there's a secret, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) says, a secret? We have got up a plot against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and Katya is mixed up in it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) thinks.
<p/>No, my good Grushenka, that's not it. You are very wide of the mark, in your foolish feminine way. Alyosha, darling, well, here goes!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) looked round, went close up quickly to Alyosha, who was standing before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), and whispered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) with an air of mystery, though in reality no one could hear them: the old warder was dozing in the corner, and not a word could reach the ears of the soldiers on guard.
<p/>I'll tell you our secret!'' '' I will tell you all our secret,'' Mitya whispered hurriedly. '' I meant to tell you later, for how could I decide on anything without you?
<p/>You are everything to me. Though I say that Ivan is superior to us, you are my angel. It's your decision will decide it.
<p/>You see, it's a question of conscience, question of the higher conscience--the secret is so important that I can't settle it myself, and I've put it off till I could speak to you.
<p/>Perhaps it's you that is superior and not Ivan. But anyway it's too early to decide now, for we must wait for the verdict.
<p/>As soon as the verdict is given, you shall decide my fate. Don't decide it now. I'll tell you now. You listen, but don't decide.
<p/>Stand and keep quiet. I won't tell you everything. I'll only tell you the idea, without details, and you keep quiet.
<p/>Not a question, not a movement. You agree? But, goodness, what shall I do with your eyes? I'm afraid your eyes will tell me your decision, even if you don't speak.
<p/>Oo! I'm afraid! Alyosha, listen! Ivan suggests my escaping . I won't tell you the details: it's all been thought out: it can all be arranged.
<p/>Hush, don't decide. I should go to America with Grusha. You know I can't live without Grusha! What if they won't let her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) follow me to Siberia?
<p/>Do they let convicts get married? Ivan thinks not. And without Grusha what should I do there underground with a hammer?
<p/>I should only smash my skull with the hammer! But, on the other hand, my conscience? I should have run away from suffering.
<p/>A sign has come, I reject the sign. I have a way of salvation and I turn my back on it.
<p/>Ivan says that in America, `with the good-will,' I can be of more use than underground. But what becomes of our hymn from underground?
<p/>What's America? America is vanity again! And there's a lot of swindling in America, too, I expect. I should have run away from crucifixion!
<p/>I tell you, you know, Alexey, because you are the only person who can understand this. There's no one else. It's folly, madness to others, all I've told you of the hymn.
<p/>They'll say I'm out of my mind or a fool. I am not out of my mind and I am not a fool.
<p/>Ivan understands about the hymn, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) understands, only he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) doesn't answer--he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) doesn't speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) doesn't believe in the hymn. Don't speak, don't speak.
<p/>I see how you look! You have already decided. Don't decide, spare me! I can't live without Grusha. Wait till after the trial!''
<p/>Mitya ended beside himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) held Alyosha with both hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shoulders, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) yearning, feverish eyes were fixed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) brother's.
<p/>'' They don't let convicts marry, do they? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) repeated for the third time in a supplicating voice. Alyosha listened with extreme surprise and was deeply moved.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me one thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said. '' Is Ivan very keen on it, and whose idea was it?'' '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is very keen on it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) didn't come to see me at first, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) suddenly came a week ago and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) began about it straight away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) doesn't doubt of my obeying him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), though I showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) all my heart as I have to you, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) about the hymn, too.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is awfully keen on it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) doesn't ask me, but orders me to escape. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'d arrange it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s found out about everything.
<p/>But of that later. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s simply set on it. It's all a matter of money: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'ll pay ten thousand for escape and give me twenty thousand for America.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) says we can arrange a magnificent escape for ten thousand.'' '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) told you on no account to tell me?''
<p/>Alyosha asked again. '' To tell no one, and especially not you; on no account to tell you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is afraid, no doubt, that you'll stand before me as my conscience.
<p/>Don't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) I told you. Don't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), for anything.'' <div class="bookquote">``You are right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha pronounced; <div class="bookquote">``it's impossible to decide anything before the trial is over.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A new man, or a Bernard who'll decide ŕ la Bernard, for I believe I'm a contemptible Bernard myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>said Mitya, with a bitter grin.
<p/>After the trial you'll decide of yourself. Then you'll find that new man in yourself and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will decide. '' But, brother, have you no hope then of being acquitted?''
<p/>Mitya shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shoulders nervously and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head. '' Alyosha, darling, it's time you were going,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said, with a sudden haste.
<p/>'' There's the superintendent shouting in the yard. He (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>)'ll be here directly. We are late; it's irregular. Embrace me quickly. Kiss me!
<p/>Sign me with the cross, darling, for the cross I have to bear to-morrow. '' They embraced and kissed. '' Ivan,'' said Mitya suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``suggests my escaping; but, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) believes I did it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>A mournful smile came on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) lips. '' Have you asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) believes it?'' asked Alyosha. ''
<p/>No, I haven't. I wanted to, but I couldn't. I hadn't the courage. But I saw it from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) eyes. Well, good-by!
<p/>'' Once more they kissed hurriedly, and Alyosha was just going out, when Mitya suddenly called him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) back. '' Stand facing me!
<p/>That's right! '' And again he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seized Alyosha, putting both hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shoulders. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face became suddenly quite pale, so that it was dreadfully apparent, even through the gathering darkness.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) lips twitched, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) eyes fastened upon Alyosha. '' Alyosha, tell me the whole truth, as you would before God. Do you believe I did it?
<p/>Do you, do you in yourself, believe it? The whole truth, don't lie!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cried desperately. Everything seemed heaving before Alyosha, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt something like a stab at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heart.
<p/>'' Hush! What do you mean? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) faltered helplessly. '' The whole truth, the whole, don't lie!'' repeated Mitya. ''
<p/>I've never for one instant believed that you were the murderer!'' broke in a shaking voice from Alyosha's breast, and he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) right hand in the air, as though calling God to witness his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) words.
<p/>Mitya's whole face was lighted up with bliss. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) articulated slowly, as though letting a sigh escape him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) after fainting.
<p/>'' Now you have given me new life. Would you believe it, till this moment I've been afraid to ask you, you, even you.
<p/>Well, go! You've given me strength for to-morrow. God bless you! Come, go along! Love Ivan! '' was Mitya's last word.
<p/>Such distrustfulness in Mitya, such lack of confidence even to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), to Alyosha--all this suddenly opened before Alyosha an unsuspected depth of hopeless grief and despair in the soul of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) unhappy brother.
<p/>Alyosha went out in tears. Intense, infinite compassion overwhelmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) instantly. There was a poignant ache in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) torn heart. ''
<p/>Love Ivan!''--he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) suddenly recalled Mitya's words. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was going to Ivan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) badly wanted to see Ivan all day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was as much worried about Ivan as about Mitya, and more than ever now.
<p/>Chapter V. Not You, Not You! On the way to Ivan he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had to pass the house where Katerina Ivanovna was living.
<p/>There was light in the windows. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) suddenly stopped and resolved to go in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had not seen Katerina Ivanovna for more than a week.
<p/>Ringing, and mounting the staircase, which was dimly lighted by a Chinese lantern, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) saw a man coming down, and as they met, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother.
<p/>But now it struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) that Ivan might be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), especially on the eve of the terrible day. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was just coming from Katerina Ivanovna.
<p/>'' Ah, it's only you,'' said Ivan dryly. '' Well, good-by! You are going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>``I don't advise you to; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'s upset and you'll upset her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) more.
<p/>A door was instantly flung open above, and a voice cried suddenly: <div class="bookquote">``No, no! Alexey Fyodorovitch, have you come from him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' Yes, I have been with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) sent me any message? Come up, Alyosha, and you, Ivan Fyodorovitch, you must come back, you must.
<p/>There was such a peremptory note in Katya's voice that Ivan, after a moment's hesitation, made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) mind to go back with Alyosha.
<p/>Do you hear? ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) was listening,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) murmured angrily to himself, but Alyosha heard it. '' Excuse my keeping my greatcoat on,'' said Ivan, going into the drawing- room.
<p/>'' I won't sit down. I won't stay more than a minute.'' <div class="bookquote">``Sit down, Alexey Fyodorovitch,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Katerina</b></font>)</div>said Katerina Ivanovna, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) remained standing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had changed very little during this time, but there was an ominous gleam in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) dark eyes. Alyosha remembered afterwards that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) as particularly handsome at that moment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only one thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha, looking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) straight in the face, <div class="bookquote">``that you would spare yourself and say nothing at the trial of what''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was a little confused-RRB- ''...
<p/>'' What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) ask you to tell me?'' passed between you ... at the time of your first acquaintance ... in that town.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! that I bowed down to the ground for that money!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) broke into a bitter laugh. '' Why, is he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) afraid for me or for himself?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) asks me to spare--whom? Him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) or myself? Tell me, Alexey Fyodorovitch!'' Alyosha watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) intently, trying to understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>). ''
<p/>Both yourself and him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>),'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) answered softly. '' I am glad to hear it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) snapped out maliciously, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) suddenly blushed.
<p/>'' You don't know me yet, Alexey Fyodorovitch,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said menacingly. '' And I don't know myself yet. Perhaps you'll want to trample me under foot after my examination to-morrow.''
<p/>Only an hour ago I was thinking I felt afraid to touch that monster ... as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) were a reptile ...
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will give your evidence honorably,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha; <div class="bookquote">``that's all that's wanted. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Women are often dishonorable,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) snarled. '' but no, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is still a human being to me!
<p/>But did he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) do it? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) the murderer? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) cried, all of a sudden, hysterically, turning quickly to Ivan.
<p/>Alyosha saw at once that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had asked Ivan that question before, perhaps only a moment before he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) came in, and not for the first time, but for the hundredth, and that they had ended by quarreling.
<p/>'' I've been to see Smerdyakov.... It was you, you who persuaded me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father. It's only you I believed!''
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) continued, still addressing Ivan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) a sort of strained smile. Alyosha started at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) tone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had not suspected such familiar intimacy between them.
<p/>'' Well, that's enough, anyway, '' Ivan cut short the conversation. '' I am going. I'll come to-morrow. '' And turning at once, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) walked out of the room and went straight downstairs.
<p/>With an imperious gesture, Katerina Ivanovna seized Alyosha by both hands. <div class="bookquote">``Follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)! Overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)! Don't leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) alone for a minute!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said, in a hurried whisper. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s mad! Don't you know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s mad? He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is in a fever, nervous fever.
<p/>The doctor told me so. Go, run after him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)...'' Alyosha jumped up and ran after Ivan, who was not fifty paces ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>'' What do you want? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) turned quickly on Alyosha, seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was running after him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) told you to catch me up, because I'm mad.
<p/>I know it all by heart,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) added irritably. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is mistaken, of course; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is right that you are ill,'' said Alyosha.
<p/>'' I was looking at your face just now. You look very ill, Ivan. '' Ivan walked on without stopping. Alyosha followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>'' And do you know, Alexey Fyodorovitch, how people do go out of their mind?'' Ivan asked in a voice suddenly quiet, without a trace of irritation, with a note of the simplest curiosity.
<p/>'' No, I don't. I suppose there are all kinds of insanity.'' '' And can one observe that one's going mad oneself?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I imagine one can't see oneself clearly in such circumstances,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha answered with surprise. Ivan paused for half a minute. ''
<p/>Oh, while I think of it, I have a letter for you,'' said Alyosha timidly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) took Lise's note from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) pocket and held it out to Ivan.
<p/>If you want to talk to me, please change the subject,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said suddenly. '' They were just under a lamp-post.
<p/>Ah, from that little demon!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) laughed maliciously, and, without opening the envelope, he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) tore it into bits and threw it in the air.
<p/>Ivan recognized the handwriting at once. '' The bits were scattered by the wind. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>)'s not sixteen yet, I believe, and already offering herself,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said contemptuously, striding along the street again.
<p/>'' How do you mean, offering herself?'' exclaimed Alyosha. '' As wanton women offer themselves, to be sure. '' <div class="bookquote">``How can you, Ivan, how can you?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha cried warmly, in a grieved voice. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) is a child; you are insulting a child! She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) is ill; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) is very ill, too.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) is on the verge of insanity, too, perhaps.... I had hoped to hear something from you ... that would save her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>).''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll hear nothing from me. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) is a child I am not her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) nurse. Be quiet, Alexey. Don't go on about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) will be praying all night now to the Mother of God to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) how to act to-morrow at the trial,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alexey</b></font>) said sharply and angrily again.
<p/>I am not even thinking about it. '' They were silent again for a moment. '' '' You ... you mean Katerina Ivanovna?''
<p/>'' Yes. Whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'s to save Mitya or ruin him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'ll pray for light from above. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) can't make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) mind for herself, you see.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) has not had time to decide yet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) takes me for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) nurse, too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) wants me to sing lullabies to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Katerina Ivanovna loves you, brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha sadly. '' Perhaps; but I am not very keen on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>). '' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is suffering.
<p/>Why do you ... sometimes say things to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) that give her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hope? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha went on, with timid reproach. ''
<p/>I know that you've given her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hope. Forgive me for speaking to you like this,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) added. '' I can't behave to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) as I ought--break off altogether and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) so straight out,'' said Ivan, irritably.
<p/>If I break off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) will avenge herself on me by ruining that scoundrel to-morrow at the trial, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hates him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) and knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hates him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>).
<p/>As long as I don't break off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) goes on hoping, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) won't ruin that monster, knowing how I want to get him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) out of trouble.
<p/>'' I must wait till sentence is passed on the murderer. It's all a lie--lie upon lie! If only that damned verdict would come!
<p/>'' The words <div class="bookquote">``murderer''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``monster''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>echoed painfully in Alyosha's heart. '' But how can she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) ruin Mitya? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) asked, pondering on Ivan's words.
<p/>'' What evidence can she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) give that would ruin Mitya?'' '' You don't know that yet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)'s got a document in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hands, in Mitya's own writing, that proves conclusively that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) did murder Fyodor Pavlovitch.
<p/>'' '' That's impossible!'' cried Alyosha. '' Why is it impossible? I've read it myself.'' '' There can't be such a document!''
<p/>Alyosha repeated warmly. '' There can't be, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s not the murderer. It's not he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) murdered father, not he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)!'' Ivan suddenly stopped.
<p/>'' Who is the murderer then, according to you?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) asked, with apparent coldness. There was even a supercilious note in his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) voice.
<p/>'' You know who,'' Alyosha pronounced in a low, penetrating voice. '' Who? You mean the myth about that crazy idiot, the epileptic, Smerdyakov?''
<p/>Alyosha suddenly felt himself trembling all over. '' You know who,'' broke helplessly from him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) could scarcely breathe. '' Who?
<p/>Who? '' Ivan cried almost fiercely. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) restraint suddenly vanished. '' I only know one thing,'' Alyosha went on, still almost in a whisper, '' it wasn't you killed father.''
<p/>'' `Not you'! What do you mean by `not you'? '' Ivan was thunderstruck. '' It was not you killed father, not you!''
<p/>Alyosha repeated firmly. The silence lasted for half a minute. '' I know I didn't. Are you raving?'' said Ivan, with a pale, distorted smile.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) eyes were riveted on Alyosha. They were standing again under a lamp-post. '' No, Ivan. You've told yourself several times that you are the murderer.''
<p/>You've said so to yourself many times, when you've been alone during these two dreadful months,'' Alyosha went on softly and distinctly as before.
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was speaking now, as it were, not of himself, not of his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) own will, but obeying some irresistible command.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When did I say so? I was in Moscow.... When have I said so? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan faltered helplessly. '' '' You have accused yourself and have confessed to yourself that you are the murderer and no one else.
<p/>But you didn't do it: you are mistaken: you are not the murderer. Do you hear? It was not you! God has sent me to tell you so.
<p/>'' They were both silent. The silence lasted a whole long minute. They were both standing still, gazing into each other's eyes.
<p/>They were both pale. Suddenly Ivan began trembling all over, and clutched Alyosha's shoulder. '' You've been in my room! ''
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) whispered hoarsely. '' You've been there at night, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) came.... Confess ... have you seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), have you seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)?''
<p/>'' Whom do you mean--Mitya?'' Alyosha asked, bewildered. <div class="bookquote">``Not him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), damn the monster!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan shouted, in a frenzy. '' Do you know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) visits me?
<p/>How did you find out? Speak!'' '' Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) ! I don't know whom you are talking about,'' Alyosha faltered, beginning to be alarmed.
<p/>'' Yes, you do know ... or how could you--? It's impossible that you don't know. '' Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) seemed to check himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) stood still and seemed to reflect. A strange grin contorted his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) lips. '' Brother,'' Alyosha began again, in a shaking voice, <div class="bookquote">``I have said this to you,
<p/>because you'll believe my word, I know that. I tell you once and for all, it's not you. You hear, once for all!
<p/>God has put it into my heart to say this to you, even though it may make you hate me from this hour.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>But by now Ivan had apparently regained his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) self-control. '' Alexey Fyodorovitch,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) said, with a cold smile, <div class="bookquote">``I can't endure prophets and epileptics--messengers from God especially--and you know that
<p/>only too well. I break off all relations with you from this moment and probably for ever. I beg you to leave me at this turning.
<p/>It's the way to your lodgings, too. You'd better be particularly careful not to come to me to-day! Do you hear?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) turned and walked on with a firm step, not looking back. '' Brother,'' Alyosha called after him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``if anything happens to you to-day, turn to me before any one!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>But Ivan made no reply. Alyosha stood under the lamp-post at the cross roads, till Ivan had vanished into the darkness.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) turned and walked slowly homewards. Both Alyosha and Ivan were living in lodgings; neither of them was willing to live in Fyodor Pavlovitch's empty house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had taken a roomy and fairly comfortable lodge attached to a fine house that belonged to a well-to-do lady, the widow of an official.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) only attendant was a deaf and rheumatic old crone who went to bed at six o'clock every evening and got up at six in the morning.
<p/>Alyosha had a furnished room in the house of some working people. Ivan lived some distance from him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). Ivan had become remarkably indifferent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) comforts of late, and very fond of being alone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) did everything for himself in the one room he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) lived in, and rarely entered any of the other rooms in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) abode.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) reached the gate of the house and had his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hand on the bell, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) suddenly stopped. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was trembling all over with anger.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) let go of the bell, turned back with a curse, and walked with rapid steps in the opposite direction.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) walked a mile and a half to a tiny, slanting, wooden house, almost a hut, where Marya Kondratyevna, the neighbor who used to come to Fyodor Pavlovitch's kitchen for soup and to whom Smerdyakov had once sung his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) songs and played on the guitar, was now lodging.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kondratyevna</b></font>) had sold their little house, and was now living here with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kondratyevna</b></font>) mother. Smerdyakov, who was ill--almost dying--had been with them ever since Fyodor Pavlovitch's death.
<p/>It was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) Ivan was going now, drawn by a sudden and irresistible prompting. Chapter VI. The First Interview With Smerdyakov
<p/>The first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) and talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was on the first day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) arrival, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had visited him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) once more, a fortnight later.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) visits had ended with that second one, so that it was now over a month since he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>This was the third time that Ivan had been to see Smerdyakov since his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) return from Moscow. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had scarcely heard anything of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>Ivan had only returned five days after his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father's death, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was not present at the funeral, which took place the day before he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) came back.
<p/>The cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) delay was that Alyosha, not knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) Moscow address, had to apply to Katerina Ivanovna to telegraph to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), not knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) address either, telegraphed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sister and aunt, reckoning on Ivan's going to see them as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) arrived in Moscow.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) did not go to them till four days after his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) arrival. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) got the telegram, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had, of course, set off post-haste to our town.
<p/>The first to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was Alyosha, and Ivan was greatly surprised to find that, in opposition to the general opinion of the town, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) refused to entertain a suspicion against Mitya, and spoke openly of Smerdyakov as the murderer.
<p/>Later on, after seeing the police captain and the prosecutor, and hearing the details of the charge and the arrest, he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was still more surprised at Alyosha, and ascribed his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) opinion only to his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) exaggerated brotherly feeling and sympathy with Mitya, of whom Alyosha, as Ivan knew, was very fond.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) positively disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>); at most, felt sometimes a compassion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), and even that was mixed with great contempt, almost repugnance.
<p/>By the way, let us say a word or two of Ivan's feeling to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother Dmitri. Mitya's whole personality, even his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) appearance, was extremely unattractive to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) went to see Mitya on the first day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) arrival, and that interview, far from shaking Ivan's belief in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) guilt, positively strengthened it.
<p/>Ivan looked with indignation on Katerina Ivanovna's love for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother agitated, nervously excited. Mitya had been talkative, but very absent-minded and incoherent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) used violent language, accused Smerdyakov, and was fearfully muddled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) talked principally about the three thousand roubles, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said had been <div class="bookquote">``stolen''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father.
<p/>'' The money was mine, it was my money,'' Mitya kept repeating. '' Even if I had stolen it, I should have had the right.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hardly contested the evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) tried to turn a fact to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) advantage, it was in an absurd and incoherent way.
<p/>Quite the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was angry and proudly scornful of the charges against him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was continually firing up and abusing every one.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) only laughed contemptuously at Grigory's evidence about the open door, and declared that it was <div class="bookquote">``the devil that opened it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Grigory/Grigory Vassilyevitch</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) hardly seemed to wish to defend himself to Ivan or any one else. '' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) could not bring forward any coherent explanation of the fact.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) even succeeded in insulting Ivan during their first interview, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) sharply that it was not for people who declared that <div class="bookquote">``everything was lawful,''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>to suspect and question him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>Altogether he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was anything but friendly with Ivan on that occasion. Immediately after that interview with Mitya, Ivan went for the first time to see Smerdyakov.
<p/>In the railway train on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) way from Moscow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) kept thinking of Smerdyakov and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) last conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) on the evening before he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) went away.
<p/>Many things seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) puzzling and suspicious. But when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) evidence to the investigating lawyer Ivan said nothing, for the time, of that conversation.
<p/>Doctor Herzenstube and Varvinsky, the doctor he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) met in the hospital, confidently asserted in reply to Ivan's persistent questions, that Smerdyakov's epileptic attack was unmistakably genuine, and were surprised indeed at Ivan asking whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) might not have been shamming on the day of the catastrophe.
<p/>They gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) to understand that the attack was an exceptional one, the fits persisting and recurring several times, so that the patient's life was positively in danger, and it was only now, after they had applied remedies, that they could assert with confidence that the patient would survive.
<p/>Though it might well be,'' added Doctor Herzenstube, <div class="bookquote">``that his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) reason would be impaired for a considerable period, if not permanently.
<p/>On Ivan's asking impatiently whether that meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was now mad, they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) that this was not yet the case, in the full sense of the word, but that certain abnormalities were perceptible.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) put that off till he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had seen Smerdyakov, who was at that time in the hospital. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Doctor</b></font>)</div>'' Ivan decided to find out for himself what those abnormalities were.
<p/>At the hospital he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was at once allowed to see the patient. Smerdyakov was lying on a truckle-bed in a separate ward.
<p/>There was only one other bed in the room, and in it lay a tradesman of the town, swollen with dropsy, who was obviously almost dying; he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) could be no hindrance to their conversation.
<p/>Smerdyakov grinned uncertainly on seeing Ivan, and for the first instant seemed nervous. So at least Ivan fancied. But that was only momentary.
<p/>For the rest of the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was struck, on the contrary, by Smerdyakov's composure. From the first glance Ivan had no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was very ill.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was very weak; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) spoke slowly, seeming to move his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) tongue with difficulty; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was much thinner and sallower. Throughout the interview, which lasted twenty minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) kept complaining of headache and of pain in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) limbs.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) thin emasculate face seemed to have become so tiny; his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hair was ruffled, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) crest of curls in front stood up in a thin tuft.
<p/>But in the left eye, which was screwed up and seemed to be insinuating something, Smerdyakov showed himself unchanged. '' It's always worth while speaking to a clever man.
<p/>'' Ivan was reminded of that at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) sat down on the stool at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) feet. Smerdyakov, with painful effort, shifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) position in bed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was not the first to speak.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) remained dumb, and did not even look much interested. '' Can you talk to me?'' asked Ivan. '' I won't tire you much.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>mumbled Smerdyakov, in a faint voice. '' Has your honor been back long? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) added patronizingly, as though encouraging a nervous visitor.
<p/>'' I only arrived to-day.... To see the mess you are in here. '' Smerdyakov sighed. '' Why do you sigh?
<p/>You knew of it all along,'' Ivan blurted out. Smerdyakov was stolidly silent for a while. '' How could I help knowing?
<p/>It was clear beforehand. But how could I tell it would turn out like that?'' <div class="bookquote">``What would turn out? Don't prevaricate!
<p/>You've foretold you'd have a fit; on the way down to the cellar, you know. You mentioned the very spot. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you said so at the examination yet? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>Smerdyakov queried with composure. Ivan felt suddenly angry. '' No, I haven't yet, but I certainly shall.
<p/>You must explain a great deal to me, my man; and let me tell you, I am not going to let you play with me!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I play with you, when I put my whole trust in you, as in God Almighty?''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>said Smerdyakov, with the same composure, only for a moment closing his (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' In the first place,'' began Ivan, <div class="bookquote">``I know that epileptic fits can't be told beforehand. I've inquired; don't try and take me in.
<p/>You can't foretell the day and the hour. How was it you told me the day and the hour beforehand, and about the cellar, too?
<p/>How could you tell that you would fall down the cellar stairs in a fit, if you didn't sham a fit on purpose?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had to go to the cellar anyway, several times a day, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>Smerdyakov drawled deliberately. '' I fell from the garret just in the same way a year ago.
<p/>It's quite true you can't tell the day and hour of a fit beforehand, but you can always have a presentiment of it.''
<p/>'' But you did foretell the day and the hour!'' '' In regard to my epilepsy, sir, you had much better inquire of the doctors here.
<p/>You can ask them whether it was a real fit or a sham; it's no use my saying any more about it.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And the cellar? How could you know beforehand of the cellar?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' You don't seem able to get over that cellar!
<p/>As I was going down to the cellar, I was in terrible dread and doubt. What frightened me most was losing you and being left without defense in all the world.
<p/>So I went down into the cellar thinking, `Here, it'll come on directly, it'll strike me down directly, shall I fall?'
<p/>And it was through this fear that I suddenly felt the spasm that always comes ... and so I went flying.
<p/>, when I told you how frightened I was and spoke of the cellar, I told all that to Doctor Herzenstube and Nikolay Parfenovitch, the investigating lawyer, and it's all been written down in the protocol.
<p/>And the doctor here, Mr. Varvinsky, maintained to all of them that it was just the thought of it brought it on, the apprehension that I might fall.
<p/>All that and all my previous conversation with you at the gate the evening before It was just then that the fit seized me.
<p/>And so they've written it down, that it's just how it must have happened, simply from my fear. '' As he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) finished, Smerdyakov drew a deep breath, as though exhausted.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had meant to frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) with the threat of repeating their conversation, and it appeared that Smerdyakov had already reported it all himself.
<p/>'' Then you have said all that in your evidence?'' said Ivan, somewhat taken aback. '' What have I to be afraid of?
<p/>Let them write down the whole truth,'' Smerdyakov pronounced firmly. '' And have you told them every word of our conversation at the gate?''
<p/>'' No, not to say every word.'' '' And did you tell them that you can sham fits, as you boasted then?''
<p/>'' No, I didn't tell them that either.'' <div class="bookquote">``Tell me now, why did you send me then to Tchermashnya?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was afraid you'd go away to Moscow; Tchermashnya is nearer, anyway.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are lying; you suggested my going away yourself; you told me to get out of the way of trouble.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That was simply out of affection and my sincere devotion to you, foreseeing trouble in the house, to spare you.
<p/>That's why I told you to get out of harm's way, that you might understand that there would be trouble in the house, and would remain at home to protect your father.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Only I wanted to spare myself even more. <div class="bookquote">``You might have said it more directly, you blockhead! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan suddenly fired up.
<p/>'' How could I have said it more directly then? It was simply my fear that made me speak, and you might have been angry, too.
<p/>I might well have been apprehensive that Dmitri Fyodorovitch would make a scene and carry away that money, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) considered it as good as his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) own; but who could tell that it would end in a murder like this?
<p/>I thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) would only carry off the three thousand that lay under the master's mattress in the envelope, and you see, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'s murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>).
<p/>How could you guess it either, sir?'' '' But if you say yourself that it couldn't be guessed, how could I have guessed and stayed at home?
<p/>You contradict yourself!'' said Ivan, pondering. '' You might have guessed from my sending you to Tchermashnya and not to Moscow.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``How could I guess it from that? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>Smerdyakov seemed much exhausted, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was silent for a minute.
<p/>You might have guessed from the fact of my asking you not to go to Moscow, but to Tchermashnya, that I wanted to have you nearer, for Moscow's a long way off, and Dmitri Fyodorovitch, knowing you are not far off, would not be so bold.
<p/>And if anything had happened, you might have come to protect me, too, for I warned you of Grigory Vassilyevitch's illness, and that I was afraid of having a fit.
<p/>And when I explained those knocks to you, by means of which one could go in to the deceased, and that Dmitri Fyodorovitch knew them all through me, I thought that you would guess yourself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) would be sure to do something, and so wouldn't go to Tchermashnya even, but would stay.
<p/>'' '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) talks very coherently,'' thought Ivan, <div class="bookquote">``though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) does mumble; what's the derangement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) faculties that Herzenstube talked of?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are cunning with me, damn you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) exclaimed, getting angry. '' But I thought at the time that you quite guessed,'' Smerdyakov parried with the simplest air.
<p/>Why, I thought that it was because you guessed, that you went away in such a hurry, only to get out of trouble, only to run away and save yourself in your fright.''
<p/>'' If I'd guessed, I should have stayed,'' cried Ivan. '' <div class="bookquote">``You think that every one is as great a coward as yourself?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``and I did guess there was some mischief brewing on your part ... only you are lying, you are lying again,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) cried, suddenly recollecting.
<p/>Do you remember how you went up to the carriage and said to me, `It's always worth while speaking to a clever man'?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, I thought you were like me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course, I ought to have guessed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan said in agitation; '' So you were glad I went away, since you praised me?''
<p/>If I was pleased,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) articulated rather breathlessly, <div class="bookquote">``it was simply because you agreed not to go to Moscow, but to Tchermashnya.
<p/>Smerdyakov sighed again and again. A trace of color came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>For it was nearer, anyway. Only when I said these words to you, it was not by way of praise, but of reproach.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, that foreseeing such a calamity you deserted your own father, and would not protect us, for I might have been taken up any time for stealing that three thousand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>You didn't understand it. '' '' What reproach?'' <div class="bookquote">``Damn you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan swore again. '' Stay, did you tell the prosecutor and the investigating lawyer about those knocks?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told them everything just as it was. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan wondered inwardly again. '' If I thought of anything then,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) began again, <div class="bookquote">``it was solely of some wickedness on your part.
<p/>Dmitri might kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) would steal--I did not believe that then.... But I was prepared for any wickedness from you.
<p/>You told me yourself you could sham a fit. What did you say that for?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' It was just through my simplicity, and I never have shammed a fit on purpose in my life.
<p/>And I only said so then to boast to you. It was just foolishness. I liked you so much then, and was open-hearted with you.''
<p/>'' My brother directly accuses you of the murder and theft. '' '' What else is left for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to do?'' said Smerdyakov, with a bitter grin.
<p/>'' And who will believe him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) with all the proofs against him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)? Grigory Vassilyevitch saw the door open. What can he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) say after that?
<p/>But never mind him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is trembling to save himself. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) slowly ceased speaking; then suddenly, as though on reflection, added: <div class="bookquote">``And look here again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wants to throw it on me and make out that it is the work of my hands--I've heard that already.
<p/>But as to my being clever at shamming a fit: should I have told you beforehand that I could sham one, if I really had had such a design against your father?
<p/>If I had been planning such a murder could I have been such a fool as to give such evidence against myself beforehand?
<p/>And to his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) son, too! Upon my word! Is that likely? As if that could be, such a thing has never happened.
<p/>No one hears this talk of ours now, except Providence itself, and if you were to tell of it to the prosecutor and Nikolay Parfenovitch you might defend me completely by doing so, for who would be likely to be such a criminal, if he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) is so open-hearted beforehand?
<p/>Any one can see that.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' Well,'' and Ivan got up to cut short the conversation, struck by Smerdyakov's last argument.
<p/>'' I don't suspect you at all, and I think it's absurd, indeed, to suspect you. On the contrary, I am grateful to you for setting my mind at rest.
<p/>Now I am going, but I'll come again. Meanwhile, good-by. Get well. Is there anything you want?'' <div class="bookquote">``I am very thankful for everything.
<p/>Marfa Ignatyevna does not forget me, and provides me anything I want, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) kindness. Good people visit me every day.
<p/>But I shan't say anything of your being able to sham a fit, and I don't advise you to, either,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>something made Ivan say suddenly.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Good-by. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I quite understand. And if you don't speak of that, I shall say nothing of that conversation of ours at the gate.
<p/>Then it happened that Ivan went out, and only when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had gone a dozen steps along the corridor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) suddenly felt that there was an insulting significance in Smerdyakov's last words.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was almost on the point of turning back, but it was only a passing impulse, and muttering, <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) chief feeling was one of relief at the fact that it was not Smerdyakov, but Mitya, who had committed the murder, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) might have been expected to feel the opposite.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) did not want to analyze the reason for this feeling, and even felt a positive repugnance at prying into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sensations.
<p/>In the following days he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) became convinced of Mitya's guilt, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) got to know all the weight of evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>There was evidence of people of no importance, Fenya and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) mother, for instance, but the effect of it was almost overpowering.
<p/>As to Perhotin, the people at the tavern, and at Plotnikov's shop, as well as the witnesses at Mokroe, their evidence seemed conclusive.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went out of the hospital. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) felt as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wanted to make haste to forget something. It was the details that were so damning.
<p/>Grigory's wife, Marfa, in answer to Ivan's questions, declared that Smerdyakov had been lying all night the other side of the partition wall.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was not three paces from our bed,'' and that although she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a sound sleeper she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) waked several times and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) moaning,
<p/>The secret of the knocks impressed the lawyers almost as much as Grigory's evidence as to the open door. '' <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was moaning the whole time, moaning continually.
<p/>Talking to Herzenstube, and giving it as his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) opinion that Smerdyakov was not mad, but only rather weak, Ivan only evoked from the old man a subtle smile.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Do you know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) spends his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) time now? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) asked; <div class="bookquote">``learning lists of French words by heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) has an exercise-book under his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) pillow with the French words written out in Russian letters for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) by some one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Ivan ended by dismissing all doubts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) could not think of Dmitri without repulsion. Only one thing was strange, however. Alyosha persisted that Dmitri was not the murderer, and that <div class="bookquote">``in all probability''  (<font color='red'><b>Dmitri the murderer</b></font>)</div>Smerdyakov was.
<p/>Another thing that was strange was that Alyosha did not make any attempt to talk about Mitya with Ivan, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) never began on the subject and only answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) questions.
<p/>Ivan always felt that Alyosha's opinion meant a great deal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was astonished at it now. This, too, struck Ivan particularly.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was very much preoccupied at that time with something quite apart from that. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) return from Moscow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) abandoned himself hopelessly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) mad and consuming passion for Katerina Ivanovna.
<p/>This is not the time to begin to speak of this new passion of Ivan's, which left its mark on all the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) life: this would furnish the subject for another novel, which I may perhaps never write.
<p/>But I cannot omit to mention here that when Ivan, on leaving Katerina Ivanovna with Alyosha, as I've related already, told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I am not keen on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>it was an absolute lie: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) madly, though at times he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) might have murdered her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>Many causes helped to bring about this feeling. Shattered by what had happened with Mitya, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) rushed on Ivan's return to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) one salvation.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was hurt, insulted and humiliated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) feelings. And here the man had come back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), who had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) so ardently before -LRB-oh!
<p/>But the sternly virtuous girl did not abandon herself altogether to the man she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) loved, in spite of the Karamazov violence of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passions and the great fascination he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was continually tormented at the same time by remorse for having deserted Mitya, and in moments of discord and violent anger -LRB-and they were numerous-RRB-
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew that very well-RRB-, and whose heart and intellect she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) considered so superior to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own. she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) told Ivan so plainly.
<p/>This was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had called to Alyosha <div class="bookquote">``lies upon lies. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>There was, of course, much that was false in it, and that angered Ivan more than anything....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) did, in fact, for a time almost forget Smerdyakov's existence, and yet, a fortnight after his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) first visit to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) began to be haunted by the same strange thoughts as before.
<p/>It's enough to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was continually asking himself, why was it that on that last night in Fyodor Pavlovitch's house he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had crept out on to the stairs like a thief and listened to hear what his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) father was doing below?
<p/>But of all this later. Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) recalled that afterwards with repulsion? Why next morning, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) been suddenly so depressed on the journey?
<p/>And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) almost fancied that these tormenting thoughts would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) even forget Katerina Ivanovna, so completely did they take possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) again.
<p/>Why, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) reached Moscow, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``I am a scoundrel'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>? It was just after fancying this, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) met Alyosha in the street.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) at once, and put a question to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Do you remember when Dmitri burst in after dinner and beat father, and afterwards I told you in the yard that I reserved `the right to desire'?...
<p/>Tell me, did you think then that I desired father's death or not?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I did think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>answered Alyosha, softly. ''
<p/>It was so, too; it was not a matter of guessing. But didn't you fancy then that what I wished was just that `one reptile should devour another'
<p/>; that is, just that Dmitri should kill father, and as soon as possible ... and that I myself was even prepared to help to bring that about?''
<p/>Alyosha turned rather pale, and looked silently into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) brother's face. <div class="bookquote">``Speak! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Ivan, <div class="bookquote">``I want above everything to know what you thought then.
<p/>I want the truth, the truth!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) drew a deep breath, looking angrily at Alyosha before his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) answer came. '' Forgive me, I did think that, too, at the time,'' whispered Alyosha, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) did not add one softening phrase.
<p/>From that time Alyosha noticed that Ivan began obviously to avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) and seemed even to have taken a dislike to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), so much so that Alyosha gave up going to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>'' Thanks,'' snapped Ivan, and, leaving Alyosha, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) went quickly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) way. Immediately after that meeting with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), Ivan had not gone home, but went straight to Smerdyakov again.
<p/>Ivan knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) new lodging, the dilapidated little wooden house, divided in two by a passage on one side of which lived Marya Kondratyevna and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kondratyevna</b></font>) mother, and on the other, Smerdyakov.
<p/>Chapter VII. The Second Visit To Smerdyakov By that time Smerdyakov had been discharged from the hospital. No one knew on what terms he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) lived with them, whether as a friend or as a lodger.
<p/>It was supposed afterwards that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had come to stay with them as Marya Kondratyevna's betrothed, and was living there for a time without paying for board or lodging.
<p/>Both mother and daughter had the greatest respect for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) and looked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) as greatly superior to themselves. Ivan knocked, and, on the door being opened, went straight into the passage.
<p/>By Marya Kondratyevna's directions he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) went straight to the better room on the left, occupied by Smerdyakov. There was a tiled stove in the room and it was extremely hot.
<p/>The walls were gay with blue paper, which was a good deal used however, and in the cracks under it cockroaches swarmed in amazing numbers, so that there was a continual rustling from them.
<p/>The furniture was very scanty: two benches against each wall and two chairs by the table. The table of plain wood was covered with a cloth with pink patterns on it.
<p/>There was a pot of geranium on each of the two little windows. In the corner there was a case of ikons.
<p/>On the table stood a little copper samovar with many dents in it, and a tray with two cups. But Smerdyakov had finished tea and the samovar was out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was sitting at the table on a bench. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was looking at an exercise-book and slowly writing with a pen.
<p/>There was a bottle of ink by him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) and a flat iron candlestick, but with a composite candle. Ivan saw at once from Smerdyakov's face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had completely recovered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) illness.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face was fresher, fuller, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hair stood up jauntily in front, and was plastered down at the sides. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was sitting in a parti-colored, wadded dressing-gown, rather dirty and frayed, however.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had spectacles on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) nose, which Ivan had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) wearing before. This trifling circumstance suddenly redoubled Ivan's anger:
<p/>Smerdyakov slowly raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) head and looked intently at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) visitor through his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) spectacles; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) slowly took them off and rose from the bench, but by no means respectfully, almost lazily, doing the least possible required by common civility.
<p/>All this struck Ivan instantly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) took it all in and noted it at once--most of all the look in Smerdyakov's eyes, positively malicious, churlish and haughty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A creature like that and wearing spectacles!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What do you want to intrude for? '' it seemed to say; <div class="bookquote">``we settled everything then; why have you come again?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan could scarcely control himself. '' It's hot here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said, still standing, and unbuttoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) overcoat. <div class="bookquote">``Take off your coat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>Smerdyakov conceded.
<p/>Ivan took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) coat and threw it on a bench with trembling hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) took a chair, moved it quickly to the table and sat down.
<p/>Smerdyakov managed to sit down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) bench before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). '' To begin with, are we alone? '' Ivan asked sternly and impulsively.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen, my good fellow; what was that you babbled, as I was leaving the hospital, that if I said nothing about your faculty of shamming fits, you wouldn't tell the investigating lawyer all our conversation at the gate?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Can they overhear us in there?'' '' No one can hear anything. You've seen for yourself: there's a passage.'' What do you mean by all ?
<p/>What could you mean by it? Were you threatening me? Have I entered into some sort of compact with you? Do you suppose I am afraid of you?
<p/>Ivan said this in a perfect fury, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) to understand with obvious intention that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) scorned any subterfuge or indirectness and meant to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) cards.
<p/>Smerdyakov's eyes gleamed resentfully, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) left eye winked, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) at once gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) answer, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) habitual composure and deliberation.
<p/>This is what I meant then, and this is why I said that, that you, knowing beforehand of this murder of your own parent, left him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) fate, and that people mightn't after that conclude any evil about your feelings and perhaps of something else, too--that's what I promised not to tell the authorities.
<p/>Though Smerdyakov spoke without haste and obviously controlling himself, yet there was something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) voice, determined and emphatic, resentful and insolently defiant.
<p/>'' '' You want to have everything above-board; very well, you shall have it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) seemed to say. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) stared impudently at Ivan.
<p/>A mist passed before Ivan's eyes for the first moment. '' How? What? Are you out of your mind?'' '' I'm perfectly in possession of all my faculties.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose I knew of the murder? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan cried at last, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) fist violently on the table.
<p/>'' What do you mean by `something else, too'? Speak, scoundrel! '' Smerdyakov was silent and still scanned Ivan with the same insolent stare.
<p/>'' Speak, you stinking rogue, what is that `something else, too'?'' '' The `something else' I meant was that you probably, too, were very desirous of your parent's death.
<p/>Ivan jumped up and struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) might on the shoulder, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) fell back against the wall.
<p/>Saying, <div class="bookquote">``It's a shame, sir, to strike a sick man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dried his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes with a very dirty blue check handkerchief and sank into quiet weeping.
<p/>'' In an instant his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face was bathed in tears. A minute passed. '' That's enough! Leave off,'' Ivan said peremptorily, sitting down again.
<p/>'' Don't put me out of all patience. '' Smerdyakov took the rag from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) eyes. Every line of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) puckered face reflected the insult he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had just received.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't know what thoughts were in your mind then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>said Smerdyakov resentfully; <div class="bookquote">``and so I stopped you then at the gate to sound you on that very point.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>So you thought then, you scoundrel, that together with Dmitri I meant to kill my father?'' '' '' To sound what, what?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, that very circumstance, whether you wanted your father to be murdered or not. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>What infuriated Ivan more than anything was the aggressive, insolent tone to which Smerdyakov persistently adhered.
<p/>'' It was you murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) cried suddenly. Smerdyakov smiled contemptuously. '' You know of yourself, for a fact, that it wasn't
<p/>I murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). And I should have thought that there was no need for a sensible man to speak of it again.''
<p/>'' But why, why had you such a suspicion about me at the time?'' '' As you know already, it was simply from fear.
<p/>I resolved to sound you, too, for I thought if you wanted the same as your brother, then the business was as good as settled and I should be crushed like a fly, too.''
<p/>For I was in such a position, shaking with fear, that I suspected every one. ``Look here, you didn't say that a fortnight ago.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I meant the same when I talked to you in the hospital, only I thought you'd understand without wasting words, and that being such a sensible man you wouldn't care to talk of it openly.
<p/>Come answer, answer, I insist: what was it ... what could I have done to put such a degrading suspicion into your mean soul?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>As for the murder, you couldn't have done that and didn't want to, but as for wanting some one else to do it, that was just what you did want.''
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``What next! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' And how coolly, how coolly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speaks! But why should I have wanted it; what grounds had I for wanting it?''
<p/>Why, after your parent's death there was at least forty thousand to come to each of you, and very likely more, but
<p/>if Fyodor Pavlovitch got married then to that lady, Agrafena Alexandrovna, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have had all his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) capital made over to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) directly after the wedding, for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s plenty of sense, so that your parent would not have left you two roubles between the three of you.
<p/>'' What grounds had you? What about the inheritance?'' said Smerdyakov sarcastically, and, as it were, vindictively. '' And were they far from a wedding, either?
<p/>Not a hair's-breadth: that lady had only to lift her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) little finger and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) would have run after her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to church, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) tongue out.
<p/>'' Ivan restrained himself with painful effort. '' Very good,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) commented at last. '' You see, I haven't jumped up, I haven't knocked you down, I haven't killed you.
<p/>Speak on. So, according to you, I had fixed on Dmitri to do it; I was reckoning on him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``How could you help reckoning on him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)?
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) would lose all the rights of a nobleman, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) rank and property, and would go off to exile; so his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) share of the inheritance would come to you and your brother Alexey Fyodorovitch in equal parts; so you'd each have not forty, but sixty thousand each.
<p/>Listen, scoundrel, if I had reckoned on any one then, it would have been on you, not on Dmitri, and I swear I did expect some wickedness from you ... at the time....
<p/>There's not a doubt you did reckon on Dmitri Fyodorovitch. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What I put up with from you! I remember my impression!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought, too, for a minute, at the time, that you were reckoning on me as well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>said Smerdyakov, with a sarcastic grin.
<p/>For if you had a foreboding about me and yet went away, you as good as said to me, `You can murder my parent, I won't hinder you!'
<p/>'' So that it was just by that more than anything you showed me what was in your mind. '' <div class="bookquote">``You scoundrel!
<p/>You were meaning to go to Moscow and refused all your father's entreaties to go to Tchermashnya--and simply at a foolish word from me you consented at once!
<p/>So that's how you understood it!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was all that going to Tchermashnya. Why! What reason had you to consent to Tchermashnya?
<p/>Since you went to Tchermashnya with no reason, simply at my word, it shows that you must have expected something from me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Then you ought, as your father's son, to have had me taken to the lock-up and thrashed at once for my words then ... or at least, to have given me a punch in the face on the spot, but you were not a bit angry, if you please, and at once in a friendly way acted on my foolish word and went away, which was utterly absurd, for you ought to have stayed to save your parent's life.
<p/>'' No, I swear I didn't!'' shouted Ivan, grinding his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) teeth. '' You didn't? How could I help drawing my conclusions?
<p/>'' Ivan sat scowling, both his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) fists convulsively pressed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) knees. '' Yes, I am sorry I didn't punch you in the face,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said with a bitter smile.
<p/>'' I couldn't have taken you to the lock-up just then. Who would have believed me and what charge could I bring against you?
<p/>But the punch in the face ... oh, I'm sorry I didn't think of it. Though blows are forbidden, I should have pounded your ugly face to a jelly.
<p/>In the ordinary occasions of life,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said in the same complacent and sententious tone in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had taunted Grigory and argued with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) about religion at Fyodor Pavlovitch's table, <div class="bookquote">``in the ordinary occasions of life, blows on the face are forbidden nowadays by law, and people have given them up, but in exceptional occasions of life people still fly to blows, not only among us but all over the world, be it even the fullest Republic of France, just as in the time of Adam and Eve, and they never will leave off, but you, even in an exceptional case, did not dare.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div>Smerdyakov looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Adam</b></font>) almost with relish. '' '' '' What are you learning French words for? '' Ivan nodded towards the exercise-book lying on the table.
<p/>Why shouldn't I learn them so as to improve my education, supposing that I may myself chance to go some day to those happy parts of Europe?''
<p/>I am not afraid of your accusations; you can say what you like about me, and if I don't beat you to death, it's simply because I suspect you of that crime
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Listen, monster. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Ivan's eyes flashed and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) trembled all over. '' and I'll drag you to justice. I'll unmask you.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To my thinking, you'd better keep quiet, for what can you accuse me of, considering my absolute innocence? and who would believe you?
<p/>Only if you begin, I shall tell everything, too, for I must defend myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you think I am afraid of you now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' If the court doesn't believe all I've said to you just now, the public will, and you will be ashamed.''
<p/>'' That's as much as to say, `It's always worth while speaking to a sensible man,' eh? '' snarled Ivan. ''
<p/>Ivan got up, shaking all over with indignation, put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) coat, and without replying further to Smerdyakov, without even looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), walked quickly out of the cottage.
<p/>You hit the mark, indeed. And you'd better be sensible. '' The cool evening air refreshed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). There was a bright moon in the sky.
<p/>A nightmare of ideas and sensations filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) soul. '' Shall I go at once and give information against Smerdyakov? But what information can I give?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is not guilty, anyway. On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'ll accuse me. And in fact, why did I set off for Tchermashnya then?
<p/>What for? What for? '' Ivan asked himself. '' Yes, of course, I was expecting something and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is right... ''
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) remembered for the hundredth time how, on the last night in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father's house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had listened on the stairs.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) remembered it now with such anguish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) stood still on the spot as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had been stabbed.
<p/>'' Yes, I expected it then, that's true! I wanted the murder, I did want the murder! Did I want the murder?
<p/>Did I want it? I must kill Smerdyakov! If I don't dare kill Smerdyakov now, life is not worth living!'' Ivan did not go home, but went straight to Katerina Ivanovna and alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) appearance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was like a madman. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) repeated all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) conversation with Smerdyakov, every syllable of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) couldn't be calmed, however much she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) tried to soothe him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) kept walking about the room, speaking strangely, disconnectedly.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) sat down, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) elbows on the table, leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hands and pronounced this strange sentence: ``If it's not Dmitri, but Smerdyakov who's the murderer, I share his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) guilt, for I put him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) up to it.
<p/>Whether I did, I don't know yet. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) is the murderer, and not Dmitri, then, of course, I am the murderer, too.
<p/>When Katerina Ivanovna heard that, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) got up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) seat without a word, went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) writing-table, opened a box standing on it, took out a sheet of paper and laid it before Ivan.
<p/>This was the document of which Ivan spoke to Alyosha later on as a <div class="bookquote">``conclusive proof''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>that Dmitri had killed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) father.
<p/>It was the letter written by Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was drunk, on the very evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) met Alyosha at the crossroads on the way to the monastery, after the scene at Katerina Ivanovna's, when Grushenka had insulted her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>).
<p/>I don't know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), but in the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was at the <div class="bookquote">``Metropolis,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>where he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) got thoroughly drunk.
<p/>'' Then, parting from Alyosha, Mitya had rushed to Grushenka. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) asked for pen and paper and wrote a document of weighty consequences to himself.
<p/>It was like the talk of a drunken man, who, on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) return home, begins with extraordinary heat telling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife or one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) household how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has just been insulted, what a rascal had just insulted him (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>), what a fine fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) is on the other hand, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) will pay that scoundrel out; and all that at great length, with great excitement and incoherence, with drunken tears and blows on the table.
<p/>It was a wordy, disconnected, frantic letter, a drunken letter in fact. The letter was written on a dirty piece of ordinary paper of the cheapest kind.
<p/>There was evidently not space enough for his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) drunken verbosity and Mitya not only filled the margins but had written the last line right across the rest.
<p/>It had been provided by the tavern and there were figures scrawled on the back of it. The letter ran as follows:
<p/>To-morrow I will get the money and repay your three thousand and farewell, woman of great wrath, but farewell, too, my love!
<p/>To-morrow I shall try and get it from every one, and if I can't borrow it, I give you my word of honor
<p/>I shall go to my father and break his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) skull and take the money from under the pillow, if only Ivan has gone.
<p/>FATAL KATYA: Let us make an end! If I have to go to Siberia for it, I'll give you back your three thousand.
<p/>And farewell. I bow down to the ground before you, for I've been a scoundrel to you. Forgive me! No, better not forgive me, you'll be happier and so shall I!
<p/>Better Siberia than your love, for I love another woman and you got to know her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) too well to-day, so how can you forgive?
<p/>I will murder the man who's robbed me! I'll leave you all and go to the East so as to see no one again.
<p/>Not her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) either, for you are not my only tormentress; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is too. Farewell! P.S.--I write my curse, but I adore you!
<p/>I hear it in my heart. One string is left, and it vibrates. Better tear my heart in two! I shall kill myself, but first of all that cur.
<p/>I shall tear three thousand from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and fling it to you. Though I've been a scoundrel to you, I am not a thief!
<p/>You can expect three thousand. The cur keeps it under his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) mattress, in pink ribbon. I am not a thief, but I'll murder my thief.
<p/>Katya, don't look disdainful. Dmitri is not a thief! but a murderer! He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) has murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) father and ruined himself to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) ground, rather than endure your pride.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) doesn't love you. P.P.S.--I kiss your feet, farewell! P.P.P.S.--Katya, pray to God that some one'll give me the money.
<p/>Then I shall not be steeped in gore, and if no one does--I shall! Kill me! Your slave and enemy, D. KARAMAZOV.
<p/>When Ivan read this <div class="bookquote">``document''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was convinced. So then it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother, not Smerdyakov. And if not Smerdyakov, then not he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), Ivan.
<p/>This letter at once assumed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) eyes the aspect of a logical proof. There could be no longer the slightest doubt of Mitya's guilt.
<p/>The suspicion never occurred to Ivan, by the way, that Mitya might have committed the murder in conjunction with Smerdyakov, and, indeed, such a theory did not fit in with the facts.
<p/>Ivan was completely reassured. The next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) only thought of Smerdyakov and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) gibes with contempt. A few days later he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) positively wondered how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) could have been so horribly distressed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) suspicions.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) made no further inquiry about Smerdyakov, but twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) happened to hear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was very ill and out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) mind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) resolved to dismiss him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) with contempt and forget him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). So passed a month. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'ll end in madness,'' the young doctor Varvinsky observed about him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), and Ivan remembered this.
<p/>During the last week of that month Ivan himself began to feel very ill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) went to consult the Moscow doctor who had been sent for by Katerina Ivanovna just before the trial.
<p/>And just at that time his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) relations with Katerina Ivanovna became acutely strained. They were like two enemies in love with one another.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna's <div class="bookquote">``returns''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Katerina</b></font>)</div>to Mitya, that is, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) brief but violent revulsions of feeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) favor, drove Ivan to perfect frenzy.
<p/>Strange to say, until that last scene described above, when Alyosha came from Mitya to Katerina Ivanovna, Ivan had never once, during that month, heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) express a doubt of Mitya's guilt, in spite of those <div class="bookquote">``returns''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>that were so hateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>It is remarkable, too, that while he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hated Mitya more and more every day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) realized that it was not on account of Katya's <div class="bookquote">``returns''  (<font color='red'><b>Katya/KATYA</b></font>)</div>that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), but just because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was the murderer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father .
<p/>Nevertheless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went to see Mitya ten days before the trial and proposed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) a plan of escape--a plan he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had obviously thought over a long time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was partly impelled to do this by a sore place still left in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heart from a phrase of Smerdyakov's, that it was to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>),
<p/>Ivan's, advantage that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother should be convicted, as that would increase his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) inheritance and Alyosha's from forty to sixty thousand roubles.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was conscious of this and fully recognized it to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) determined to sacrifice thirty thousand on arranging Mitya's escape.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) return from seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was very mournful and dispirited; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) suddenly began to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was anxious for Mitya's escape, not only to heal that sore place by sacrificing thirty thousand, but for another reason.
<p/>'' Is it because I am as much a murderer at heart? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) asked himself. Something very deep down seemed burning and rankling in his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) soul.
<p/>But of that later.... When, after his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) conversation with Alyosha, Ivan suddenly decided with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hand on the bell of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) lodging to go to Smerdyakov, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) obeyed a sudden and peculiar impulse of indignation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) suddenly remembered how Katerina Ivanovna had only just cried out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) in Alyosha's presence: <div class="bookquote">``It was you, you, persuaded me of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>-LRB-that is, Mitya's-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``guilt!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had never once tried to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) that Mitya was the murderer; on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had suspected himself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) presence, that time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) came back from Smerdyakov.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pride above all suffered cruelly all that month. Ivan was thunderstruck when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) recalled it. It was she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) , she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), who had produced that <div class="bookquote">``document''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and proved his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother's guilt.
<p/>And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) suddenly exclaimed: <div class="bookquote">``I've been at Smerdyakov's myself!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>When had she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) been there? Ivan had known nothing of it.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was not at all so sure of Mitya's guilt! And what could Smerdyakov have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)? What, what, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>)?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) could not understand how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) could, half an hour before, have let those words pass and not have cried out at the moment.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heart burned with violent anger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) let go of the bell and rushed off to Smerdyakov. '' I shall kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), perhaps, this time,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) thought on the way.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was half-way there, the keen dry wind that had been blowing early that morning rose again, and a fine dry snow began falling thickly.
<p/>It did not lie on the ground, but was whirled about by the wind, and soon there was a regular snowstorm.
<p/>Chapter VIII. The Third And Last Interview With Smerdyakov There were scarcely any lamp-posts in the part of the town where Smerdyakov lived.
<p/>Ivan strode alone in the darkness, unconscious of the storm, instinctively picking out his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) way. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) head ached and there was a painful throbbing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) temples.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hands were twitching convulsively. Not far from Marya Kondratyevna's cottage, Ivan suddenly came upon a solitary drunken little peasant.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was wearing a coarse and patched coat, and was walking in zigzags, grumbling and swearing to himself. Then suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) would begin singing in a husky drunken voice:
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) broke off every time at the second line and began swearing again; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) would begin the same song again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ach, Vanka's gone to Petersburg; I won't wait till he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) comes back. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan felt an intense hatred for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had thought about him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) at all.
<p/>At that moment they met, and the peasant with a violent lurch fell full tilt against Ivan, who pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) back furiously.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) realized his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) presence and felt an irresistible impulse to knock him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) down. The peasant went flying backwards and fell like a log on the frozen ground.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) uttered one plaintive <div class="bookquote">``O--oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and then was silent. Ivan stepped up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) back, without movement or consciousness.
<p/>In the passage, Marya Kondratyevna, who ran out to open the door with a candle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kondratyevna</b></font>) hand, whispered that Smerdyakov was very ill, <div class="bookquote">``It's not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s laid up, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) seems not himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) even told us to take the tea away; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) wouldn't have any.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div><p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) will be frozen,'' thought Ivan, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) way to Smerdyakov's. <div class="bookquote">``Why, does he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) make a row?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>asked Ivan coarsely.
<p/>'' Oh, dear, no, quite the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s very quiet. Only please don't talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) too long,'' Marya Kondratyevna begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>Ivan opened the door and stepped into the room. It was over-heated as before, but there were changes in the room.
<p/>One of the benches at the side had been removed, and in its place had been put a large old mahogany leather sofa, on which a bed had been made up, with fairly clean white pillows.
<p/>Smerdyakov was sitting on the sofa, wearing the same dressing-gown. The table had been brought out in front of the sofa, so that there was hardly room to move.
<p/>On the table lay a thick book in yellow cover, but Smerdyakov was not reading it. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) seemed to be sitting doing nothing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) met Ivan with a slow silent gaze, and was apparently not at all surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) coming. There was a great change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was much thinner and sallower.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) eyes were sunken and there were blue marks under them. '' Why, you really are ill?'' Ivan stopped short. ''
<p/>I won't keep you long, I won't even take off my coat. Where can one sit down?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) went to the other end of the table, moved up a chair and sat down on it.
<p/>'' Why do you look at me without speaking? I've only come with one question, and I swear I won't go without an answer.
<p/>Has the young lady, Katerina Ivanovna, been with you?'' Smerdyakov still remained silent, looking quietly at Ivan as before. Suddenly, with a motion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face away.
<p/>'' What's the matter with you?'' cried Ivan. '' Nothing. '' '' What do you mean by `nothing'? '' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) has.
<p/>It's no matter to you. Let me alone.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' No, I won't let you alone. Tell me, when was she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) here?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, I'd quite forgotten about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>said Smerdyakov, with a scornful smile, and turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face to Ivan again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) with a look of frenzied hatred,
<p/>the same look that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) at their last interview, a month before. '' You seem very ill yourself, your face is sunken; you don't look like yourself,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said to Ivan.
<p/>'' Never mind my health, tell me what I ask you.'' '' But why are your eyes so yellow? The whites are quite yellow.
<p/>Are you so worried?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) smiled contemptuously and suddenly laughed outright. '' Listen ; I've told you I won't go away without an answer!''
<p/>Ivan cried, intensely irritated. '' Why do you keep pestering me? Why do you torment me?'' said Smerdyakov, with a look of suffering.
<p/>'' Damn it! I've nothing to do with you. Just answer my question and I'll go away.'' '' I've no answer to give you,'' said Smerdyakov, looking down again.
<p/>'' You may be sure I'll make you answer!'' <div class="bookquote">``Why are you so uneasy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>Smerdyakov stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), not simply with contempt, but almost with repulsion.
<p/>'' Is this because the trial begins to- morrow? Nothing will happen to you; can't you believe that at last? Go home, go to bed and sleep in peace, don't be afraid of anything.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't understand you.... What have I to be afraid of to-morrow?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan articulated in astonishment, and suddenly a chill breath of fear did in fact pass over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) soul.
<p/>Smerdyakov measured him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) eyes. '' You don't understand? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) drawled reproachfully. '' It's a strange thing a sensible man should care to play such a farce!''
<p/>Ivan looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) speechless. The startling, incredibly supercilious tone of this man who had once been his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) valet, was extraordinary in itself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had not taken such a tone even at their last interview. '' I tell you, you've nothing to be afraid of.
<p/>I won't say anything about you; there's no proof against you. I say, how your hands are trembling! Why are your fingers moving like that?
<p/>Go home, you did not murder him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). '' Ivan started. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) remembered Alyosha. '' I know it was not I,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) faltered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>Smerdyakov caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) up again. Ivan jumped up and seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) by the shoulder. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me everything, you viper!
<p/>Tell me everything!''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>Smerdyakov was not in the least scared. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) only riveted his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) eyes on Ivan with insane hatred. ''
<p/>Well, it was you who murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), if that's it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) whispered furiously. Ivan sank back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) chair, as though pondering something.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) laughed malignantly. '' You mean my going away. What you talked about last time?'' <div class="bookquote">``You stood before me last time and understood it all, and you understand it now.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' All I understand is that you are mad.'' <div class="bookquote">``Aren't you tired of it? Here we are face to face; what's the use of going on keeping up a farce to each other?
<p/>You murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>); you are the real murderer, I was only your instrument, your faithful servant, and it was following your words I did it.
<p/>Are you still trying to throw it all on me, to my face? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Did it? Why, did you murder him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)?''
<p/>Ivan turned cold. Something seemed to give way in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brain, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) shuddered all over with a cold shiver. Then Smerdyakov himself looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) wonderingly; probably the genuineness of Ivan's horror struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>'' You don't mean to say you really did not know? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) faltered mistrustfully, looking with a forced smile into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Ivan still gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), and seemed unable to speak. Ach, Vanka's gone to Petersburg; I won't wait till he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) comes back, suddenly echoed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) head.
<p/>'' Do you know, I am afraid that you are a dream, a phantom sitting before me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) muttered. '' There's no phantom here, but only us two and one other.
<p/>No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is here, that third, between us.'' '' Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)? Who is here? What third person?'' Ivan cried in alarm, looking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) eyes hastily searching in every corner.
<p/>'' That third is God Himself--Providence. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is the third beside us now. Only don't look for Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), you won't find Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''
<p/>'' It's a lie that you killed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!'' Ivan cried madly. '' You are mad, or teasing me again! '' Smerdyakov, as before, watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) curiously, with no sign of fear.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) could still scarcely get over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) incredulity; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) still fancied that Ivan knew everything and was trying to <div class="bookquote">``throw it all on him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said at last in a weak voice, and suddenly bringing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) left leg from under the table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) began turning up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) trouser leg.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was wearing long white stockings and slippers. Slowly he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) garter and fumbled to the bottom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) stocking.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) cried, and rapidly jumping up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) drew back, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) knocked his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) back against the wall and stood up against it, stiff and straight.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) looked with insane terror at Smerdyakov, who, entirely unaffected by his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) terror, continued fumbling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) stocking, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) were making an effort to get hold of something with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) fingers and pull it out.
<p/>Ivan gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), and suddenly shuddered in a paroxysm of terror. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s mad! At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) got hold of it and began pulling it out.
<p/>Ivan saw that it was a piece of paper, or perhaps a roll of papers. Smerdyakov pulled it out and laid it on the table.
<p/>'' Here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said quietly. '' What is it?'' asked Ivan, trembling. '' Kindly look at it,'' Smerdyakov answered, still in the same low tone.
<p/>Ivan stepped up to the table, took up the roll of paper and began unfolding it, but suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) drew back his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) fingers, as though from contact with a loathsome reptile.
<p/>'' Your hands keep twitching,'' observed Smerdyakov, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) deliberately unfolded the bundle himself. Under the wrapper were three packets of hundred-rouble notes.
<p/>'' They are all here, all the three thousand roubles; you need not count them. Take them,'' Smerdyakov suggested to Ivan, nodding at the notes.
<p/>Ivan sank back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) chair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was as white as a handkerchief. '' You frightened me ... with your stocking,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said, with a strange grin.
<p/>'' Can you really not have known till now? '' Smerdyakov asked once more. '' No, I did not know. I kept thinking of Dmitri.
<p/>Brother, brother! Ach! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) suddenly clutched his (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) head in both hands. <div class="bookquote">``Listen. Did you kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) alone? With my brother's help or without?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It was only with you, with your help, I killed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and Dmitri Fyodorovitch is quite innocent.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' All right, all right.
<p/>Talk about me later. Why do I keep on trembling? I can't speak properly.'' <div class="bookquote">``You were bold enough then. You said `everything was lawful,' and how frightened you are now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>Smerdyakov muttered in surprise.
<p/>'' Won't you have some lemonade? I'll ask for some at once. It's very refreshing. Only I must hide this first.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was just going to get up and call at the door to Marya Kondratyevna to make some lemonade and bring it them, but, looking for something to cover up the notes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kondratyevna</b></font>) might not see them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) first took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) handkerchief, and as it turned out to be very dirty, took up the big yellow book that Ivan had noticed at first lying on the table, and put it over the notes.
<p/>'' And again he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) motioned at the notes. The book was The Sayings of the Holy Father Isaac the Syrian .
<p/>Ivan read it mechanically. '' I won't have any lemonade,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said. '' Talk of me later. Sit down and tell me how you did it.
<p/>Ivan, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'d only just thought of it, took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) coat, and, without getting up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) chair, threw it on the bench.
<p/>Tell me all about it.'' '' You'd better take off your greatcoat, or you'll be too hot. '' '' Speak, please, speak.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) seemed calmer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) waited, feeling sure that Smerdyakov would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) all about it. '' How it was done?'' sighed Smerdyakov.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of my words later,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan broke in again, apparently with complete self- possession, firmly uttering his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) words, and not shouting as before.
<p/>'' It was done in a most natural way, following your very words.'' '' Only tell me in detail how you did it.
<p/>Everything, as it happened. Don't forget anything. The details, above everything, the details, I beg you.'' '' You'd gone away, then I fell into the cellar.''
<p/>I went quietly down the steps to the very bottom and lay down quietly, and as I lay down I gave a scream, and struggled, till they carried me out.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In a fit or in a sham one?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``A sham one, naturally. I shammed it all. <div class="bookquote">``Stay! And were you shamming all along, afterwards, and in the hospital?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Next day, in the morning, before they took me to the hospital, I had a real attack and a more violent one than I've had for years.
<p/>'' No, not at all. For two days I was quite unconscious. '' '' All right, all right. Go on.'' <div class="bookquote">``They laid me on the bed.
<p/>I knew I'd be the other side of the partition, for whenever I was ill, Marfa Ignatyevna used to put me there, near them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s always been very kind to me, from my birth up. At night I moaned, but quietly. I kept expecting Dmitri Fyodorovitch to come.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) to come into the house, for I'd no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'d come that night, for being without me and getting no news, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'d be sure to come and climb over the fence, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) used to, and do something.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)? To come to you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not to me.

<p/>I should never have brought myself to it without him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' All right, all right ... speak more intelligibly, don't hurry; above all, don't leave anything out!''
<p/>``I expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) to kill Fyodor Pavlovitch. I thought that was certain, for I had prepared him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) for it ... during the last few days....
<p/>With his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) suspiciousness and the fury which had been growing in him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) all those days, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was bound to get into the house by means of those taps.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan interrupted; <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) would have taken the money and carried it away; you must have considered that.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) knew about the knocks, that was the chief thing. That was inevitable, so I was expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>What would you have got by it afterwards?
<p/>I don't see.'' '' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) would never have found the money. That was only what I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), that the money was under the mattress.
<p/>And afterwards I suggested to Fyodor Pavlovitch, as I was the only person he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) trusted, to hide the envelope with the notes in the corner behind the ikons, for no one would have guessed that place, especially if they came in a hurry.
<p/>But that wasn't true. It had been lying in a box. So that's where the envelope lay, in the corner behind the ikons.
<p/>It would have been absurd to keep it under the mattress; the box, anyway, could be locked. But all believe it was under the mattress.
<p/>So if Dmitri Fyodorovitch had committed the murder, finding nothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) would either have run away in a hurry, afraid of every sound, as always happens with murderers, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) would have been arrested.
<p/>So I could always have clambered up to the ikons and have taken away the money next morning or even that night, and it would have all been put down to Dmitri Fyodorovitch.
<p/>A stupid thing to believe. I could reckon upon that.'' '' But what if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) did not kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), but only knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) down?''
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) did not kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), of course, I would not have ventured to take the money, and nothing would have happened.
<p/>But I calculated that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) would beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) senseless, and I should have time to take it then, and then I'd make out to Fyodor Pavlovitch that it was no one
<p/>'' but Dmitri Fyodorovitch who had taken the money after beating him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``Stop ... I am getting mixed. Then it was Dmitri after all who killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>); you only took the money?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) didn't kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>). Well, I might as well have told you now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was the murderer.... But I don't want to lie to you now,
<p/>because ... because if you really haven't understood till now, as I see for myself, and are not pretending, so as to throw your guilt on me to my very face, you are still responsible for it all, since you knew of the murder and charged me to do it, and went away knowing all about it.
<p/>And so I want to prove to your face this evening that you are the only real murderer in the whole affair, and I am not the real murderer, though I did kill him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>).
<p/>Ivan cried, unable to restrain himself at last, and forgetting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had put off discussing himself till the end of the conversation.
<p/>You are the rightful murderer. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why, why, am I a murderer? Oh, God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tchermashnya</b></font>)</div>'' You still mean that Tchermashnya? Stay, tell me, why did you want my consent, if you really took Tchermashnya for consent?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Assured of your consent, I should have known that you wouldn't have made an outcry over those three thousand being lost, even if I'd been suspected, instead of Dmitri Fyodorovitch, or as his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) accomplice; on the contrary, you would have protected me from others....
<p/>And when you got your inheritance you would have rewarded me when you were able, all the rest of your life.
<p/>For you'd have received your inheritance through me, seeing that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had married Agrafena Alexandrovna, you wouldn't have had a farthing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>How will you explain that now?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! Then you intended to worry me all my life afterwards,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>snarled Ivan. '' And what if I hadn't gone away then, but had informed against you?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What could you have informed? That I persuaded you to go to Tchermashnya? That's all nonsense. Besides, after our conversation you would either have gone away or have stayed.
<p/>If you had stayed, nothing would have happened. I should have known that you didn't want it done, and should have attempted nothing.
<p/>As you went away, it meant you assured me that you wouldn't dare to inform against me at the trial, and that you'd overlook my having the three thousand.
<p/>because then I should have told it all in the court; that is, not that I had stolen the money or killed him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>)--I shouldn't have said that--but that you'd put me up to the theft and the murder, though I didn't consent to it.
<p/>That's why I needed your consent, so that you couldn't have cornered me afterwards, for what proof could you have had?

(<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Ivan snarled again. '' To be sure you were, and by your consent you silently sanctioned my doing it.
<p/>'' Smerdyakov looked resolutely at Ivan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was very weak and spoke slowly and wearily, but some hidden inner force urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) on.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) evidently had some design. Ivan felt that. '' Go on,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me what happened that night.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What more is there to tell!
<p/>And before that Grigory Vassilyevitch had suddenly got up and came out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) suddenly gave a scream, and then all was silence and darkness.
<p/>I lay there and I thought I heard the master shout. I lay there waiting, my heart beating; I couldn't bear it.
<p/>I saw the window open on the left into the garden, and I stepped to the left to listen whether he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was sitting there alive, and I heard the master moving about, sighing, so
<p/>I got up at last, went out. I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was alive. ' Ech!' I thought. I went to the window and shouted to the master, `It's I.'
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) shouted to me, `He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'s been, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'s been ; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'s run away.' He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) meant Dmitri Fyodorovitch had been. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'s killed Grigory!'
<p/>' Where?' I whispered. ' There, in the corner,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) pointed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was whispering, too. ' Wait a bit,' I said.
<p/>I went to the corner of the garden to look, and there I came upon Grigory Vassilyevitch lying by the wall, covered with blood, senseless.
<p/>So it's true that Dmitri Fyodorovitch has been here, was the thought that came into my head, and I determined on the spot to make an end of it, as Grigory Vassilyevitch, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) were alive, would see nothing of it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) lay there senseless.
<p/>I felt that at the moment, but the longing to get it done came over me, till I could scarcely breathe.
<p/>I went back to the window to the master and said, `She (<font color='blue'><b>Vassilyevitch</b></font>)'s here, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vassilyevitch</b></font>)'s come; Agrafena Alexandrovna has come, wants to be let in.'
<p/>The only risk was that Marfa Ignatyevna might wake up. And he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) started like a baby. ' Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Vassilyevitch</b></font>)?' he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) fairly gasped, but couldn't believe it. '
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Vassilyevitch</b></font>)'s standing there,' said I. `Open.' He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) looked out of the window at me, half believing and half distrustful, but afraid to open. '
<p/>I bethought me to knock on the window-frame those taps we'd agreed upon as a signal that Grushenka had come, in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) presence, before his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) didn't seem to believe my word, but as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) heard the taps, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) ran at once to open the door.
<p/>Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is afraid of me now,' I thought. And it was funny. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) opened it. I would have gone in, but he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) stood in the way to prevent me passing. '
<p/>Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)? Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)?' He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) looked at me, all of a tremble. ' Well,' thought I, `if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)'s so frightened of me as all that, it's a bad look out!'
<p/>And my legs went weak with fright that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wouldn't let me in or would call out, or Marfa Ignatyevna would run up, or something else might happen.
<p/>I don't remember now, but I must have stood pale, facing him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). I whispered to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), `Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)'s there, there, under the window; how is it you don't see her (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)?'
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)'s afraid,' said I; `she (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>) was frightened at the noise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)'s hidden in the bushes; go and call to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>) yourself from the study.'
<p/>I said. ' Bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>) then, bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>).' ' He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) ran to the window, put the candle in the window. '
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) cried that, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) didn't want to lean out of the window, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) didn't want to move away from me, for he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was panic-stricken; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was so frightened he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) didn't dare to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) back on me. '
<p/>Grushenka,' he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) cried, `Grushenka, are you here?' Why, here she (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>) is,' said I. I went up to the window and leaned right out of it. '
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) suddenly believed it; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was all of a shake--he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was awfully crazy about her (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)--and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) leaned right out of the window.
<p/>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>) is; she (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)'s in the bush, laughing at you, don't you see her (<font color='blue'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)?' I snatched up that iron paper-weight from his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) table; do you remember, weighing about three pounds?
<p/>I swung it and hit him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) on the top of the skull with the corner of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) didn't even cry out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) only sank down suddenly, and I hit him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) again and a third time. And the third time I knew I'd broken his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) skull.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) suddenly rolled on his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) back, face upwards, covered with blood. I looked round. There was no blood on me, not a spot.
<p/>I wiped the paper-weight, put it back, went up to the ikons, took the money out of the envelope, and flung the envelope on the floor and the pink ribbon beside it.
<p/>I went out into the garden all of a tremble, straight to the apple-tree with a hollow in it--you know that hollow.
<p/>I'd marked it long before and put a rag and a piece of paper ready in it. I wrapped all the notes in the rag and stuffed it deep down in the hole.
<p/>I went back to my bed, lay down and thought, `If Grigory Vassilyevitch has been killed outright it may be a bad job for me, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is not killed and recovers, it will be first-rate, for then he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)'ll bear witness that Dmitri Fyodorovitch has been here, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) must have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) and taken the money.'
<p/>And there it stayed for over a fortnight. I took it out later, when I came out of the hospital. Then I began groaning with suspense and impatience, so as to wake Marfa Ignatyevna as soon as possible.
<p/>At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Ignatyevna</b></font>) got up and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ignatyevna</b></font>) rushed to me, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ignatyevna</b></font>) saw Grigory Vassilyevitch was not there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ignatyevna</b></font>) ran out, and I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Ignatyevna</b></font>) scream in the garden.
<p/>And that set it all going and set my mind at rest. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) stopped. Ivan had listened all the time in dead silence without stirring or taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) eyes off him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) story Smerdyakov glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) from time to time, but for the most part kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) eyes averted.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had finished he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was evidently agitated and was breathing hard. The perspiration stood out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face. But it was impossible to tell whether it was remorse he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was feeling, or what.
<p/>'' Stay,'' cried Ivan, pondering. '' What about the door? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) only opened the door to you, how could Grigory have seen it open before?
<p/>It was remarkable that Ivan spoke quite amicably, in a different tone, not angry as before, so if any one had opened the door at that moment and peeped in at them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) would certainly have concluded that they were talking peaceably about some ordinary, though interesting, subject.
<p/>As for that door and Grigory Vassilyevitch's having seen it open, that's only his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) fancy,'' said Smerdyakov, with a wry smile.
<p/>For Grigory saw it before you went. '' '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is not a man, I assure you, but an obstinate mule.
<p/>It's just our luck he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) took that notion into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) head, for they can't fail to convict Dmitri Fyodorovitch after that.''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) didn't see it, but fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had seen it, and there's no shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Listen ...''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Ivan, beginning to seem bewildered again and making an effort to grasp something.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen. There are a lot of questions I want to ask you, but I forget them ... I keep forgetting and getting mixed up.
<p/>Yes. Tell me this at least, why did you open the envelope and leave it there on the floor? Why didn't you simply carry off the envelope?...
<p/>When you were telling me, I thought you spoke about it as though it were the right thing to do ...
<p/>For if a man had known all about it, as I did for instance, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d seen those notes before, and perhaps had put them in that envelope himself, and had seen the envelope sealed up and addressed, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own eyes, if such a man had done the murder, what should have made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tear open the envelope afterwards, especially in such desperate haste, since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d know for certain the notes must be in the envelope?
<p/>No, if the robber had been some one like me, he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>)'d simply have put the envelope straight in his (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) pocket and got away with it as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) could.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) only knew about the envelope by hearsay; he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) had never seen it, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>)'d found it, for instance, under the mattress, he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>)'d have torn it open as quickly as possible to make sure the notes were in it.
<p/>but why, I can't understand...''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I did that for a good reason. But it'd be quite different with Dmitri Fyodorovitch. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'d have thrown the envelope down, without having time to think that it would be evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>).
<p/>Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was not an habitual thief and had never directly stolen anything before, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is a gentleman born, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) did bring himself to steal, it would not be regular stealing, but simply taking what was his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) own, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'d told the whole town he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) meant to before, and had even bragged aloud before every one that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'d go and take his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) property from Fyodor Pavlovitch.
<p/>I didn't say that openly to the prosecutor when I was being examined, but quite the contrary, I brought him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) to it by a hint, as though I didn't see it myself, and as though he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>)'d thought of it himself
<p/>and I hadn't prompted him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>); so that Mr. Prosecutor's mouth positively watered at my suggestion.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' But can you possibly have thought of all that on the spot?
<p/>'' cried Ivan, overcome with astonishment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) looked at Smerdyakov again with alarm. '' Mercy on us! Could any one think of it all in such a desperate hurry?
<p/>It was all thought out beforehand.'' '' Well ... well, it was the devil helped you!'' Ivan cried again. '' No, you are not a fool, you are far cleverer than I thought....
<p/>But as the table blocked his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) way, and there was hardly room to pass between the table and the wall, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) only turned round where he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) stood and sat down again.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) got up, obviously intending to walk across the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was in terrible distress. Perhaps the impossibility of moving irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) suddenly cried out almost as furiously as before.
<p/>Don't you understand that if I haven't killed you, it's simply because I am keeping you to answer to-morrow at the trial.
<p/>God sees,'' Ivan raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps I, too, was guilty; perhaps I really had a secret desire for my father's ... death, but I swear I was not as guilty as you think, and perhaps I didn't urge you on at all.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Listen, you miserable, contemptible creature! No, no, I didn't urge you on! But no matter, I will give evidence against myself to-morrow at the trial.
<p/>And whatever you may say against me at the trial, whatever evidence you give, I'll face it; I am not afraid of you.
<p/>I'm determined to! I shall tell everything, everything. But we'll make our appearance together. I'll confirm it all myself! But you must confess, too!
<p/>Ivan said this solemnly and resolutely and from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) flashing eyes alone it could be seen that it would be so.
<p/>You must, you must; we'll go together. That's how it shall be!'' '' You are ill, I see; you are quite ill.
<p/>Your eyes are yellow,'' Smerdyakov commented, without the least irony, with apparent sympathy in fact. '' We'll go together,'' Ivan repeated.
<p/>'' And if you won't go, no matter, I'll go alone. '' Smerdyakov paused as though pondering. '' There'll be nothing of the sort, and you won't go,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) concluded at last positively.
<p/>And, what's more, it will be no use at all, for I shall say straight out that I never said anything of the sort to you, and that you are either ill -LRB-and it looks like it, too-RRB-, or that you're so sorry for your brother that you are sacrificing yourself to save him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) and have invented it all against me, for you've always thought no more of me than if I'd been a fly.
<p/>'' You don't understand me,'' Ivan exclaimed reproachfully. '' You'll be too much ashamed, if you confess it all. And who will believe you, and what single proof have you got?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen, you showed me those notes just now to convince me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>Smerdyakov lifted the book off the notes and laid it on one side.
<p/>'' Take that money away with you,'' Smerdyakov sighed. '' Of course, I shall take it. But why do you give it to me, if you committed the murder for the sake of it?
<p/>'' Ivan looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) with great surprise. '' I don't want it,'' Smerdyakov articulated in a shaking voice, with a gesture of refusal.
<p/>'' I did have an idea of beginning a new life with that money in Moscow or, better still, abroad. I did dream of it, chiefly because `all things are lawful.'
<p/>That was quite right what you taught me, for you talked a lot to me about that. For if there's no everlasting God, there's no such thing as virtue, and there's no need of it.
<p/>You were right there. So that's how I looked at it. '' <div class="bookquote">``Did you come to that of yourself? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>asked Ivan, with a wry smile.
<p/>'' With your guidance.'' '' And now, I suppose, you believe in God, since you are giving back the money?'' ''
<p/>No, I don't believe,'' whispered Smerdyakov. '' Then why are you giving it back?'' <div class="bookquote">``Leave off ... that's enough!''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>Smerdyakov waved his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand again.
<p/>'' You used to say yourself that everything was lawful, so now why are you so upset, too? You even want to go and give evidence against yourself....
<p/>Only there'll be nothing of the sort! You won't go to give evidence,'' Smerdyakov decided with conviction. '' You'll see,'' said Ivan.
<p/>You like to be respected, too, for you're very proud; you are far too fond of female charms, too, and you mind most of all about living in undisturbed comfort, without having to depend on any one--that's what you care most about.
<p/>'' It isn't possible. You are very clever. You are fond of money, I know that. You won't want to spoil your life for ever by taking such a disgrace on yourself.
<p/>You are like Fyodor Pavlovitch, you are more like him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) than any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) children; you've the same soul as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You are not a fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Ivan, seeming struck. The blood rushed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face. '' You are serious now!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) observed, looking suddenly at Smerdyakov with a different expression. '' It was your pride made you think I was a fool.
<p/>Take the money. '' Ivan took the three rolls of notes and put them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) pocket without wrapping them in anything.
<p/>Nobody will believe you, as you've plenty of money of your own; you may simply have taken it out of your cash-box and brought it to the court.
<p/>I repeat,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the only reason I haven't killed you is that I need you for to-morrow, remember that, don't forget it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' I shall show them at the court to-morrow,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said. '' '' Ivan rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) seat. '' '' Well, kill me.
<p/>Kill me now,'' Smerdyakov said, all at once looking strangely at Ivan. '' You won't dare do that even! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) added, with a bitter smile.
<p/>'' You won't dare to do anything, you, who used to be so bold!'' <div class="bookquote">``Till to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Ivan, and moved to go out.
<p/>'' Stay a moment.... Show me those notes again. '' Ivan took out the notes and showed them to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). Smerdyakov looked at them for ten seconds.
<p/>'' Well, you can go,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said, with a wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hand. '' Ivan Fyodorovitch! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) called after him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) again.
<p/>'' What do you want? '' Ivan turned without stopping. '' Good-by!'' <div class="bookquote">``Till to-morrow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan cried again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) walked out of the cottage.
<p/>The snowstorm was still raging. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) walked the first few steps boldly, but suddenly began staggering. '' It's something physical,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) thought with a grin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was conscious of unbounded resolution; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) would make an end of the wavering that had so tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) of late.
<p/>Something like joy was springing up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) heart. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) determination was taken, <div class="bookquote">``and now it will not be changed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) thought with relief.
<p/>At that moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) stumbled against something and almost fell down. Stopping short, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) made out at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) feet the peasant he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had knocked down, still lying senseless and motionless.
<p/>Seeing a light in the little house to the right he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) went up, knocked at the shutters, and asked the man to whom the house belonged to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) carry the peasant to the police-station, promising him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) three roubles.
<p/>The snow had almost covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face. Ivan seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) and lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) arms. The man got ready and came out.
<p/>I won't describe in detail how Ivan succeeded in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) object, bringing the peasant to the police-station and arranging for a doctor to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) at once, providing with a liberal hand for the expenses.
<p/>I will only say that this business took a whole hour, but Ivan was well content with it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) mind wandered and worked incessantly.
<p/>If I had not taken my decision so firmly for to-morrow,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) reflected with satisfaction, <div class="bookquote">``I should not have stayed a whole hour to look after the peasant, but should have passed by, without caring about his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) being frozen.
<p/>I am quite capable of watching myself, by the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) thought at the same instant, with still greater satisfaction, <div class="bookquote">``although they have decided that I am going out of my mind!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Just as he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) reached his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) own house he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) stopped short, asking himself suddenly hadn't he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) better go at once to the prosecutor and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) everything.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) decided the question by turning back to the house. '' Everything together to-morrow!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) whispered to himself, and, strange to say, almost all his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) gladness and self-satisfaction passed in one instant.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) entered his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) own room he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) felt something like a touch of ice on his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) heart, like a recollection or, more exactly, a reminder, of something agonizing and revolting that was in that room now, at that moment, and had been there before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) sank wearily on his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) sofa. The old woman brought him (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) a samovar; he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) made tea, but did not touch it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) sat on the sofa and felt giddy. He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was ill and helpless. He (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was beginning to drop asleep, but got up uneasily and walked across the room to shake off his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) drowsiness.
<p/>At moments he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) was delirious, but it was not illness that he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) thought of most. Sitting down again, he (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) began looking round, as though searching for something.
<p/>This happened several times. At last his (<font color='blue'><b>peasant</b></font>) eyes were fastened intently on one point. Ivan smiled, but an angry flush suffused his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) sat a long time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) place, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) head propped on both arms, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) looked sideways at the same point, at the sofa that stood against the opposite wall.
<p/>There was evidently something, some object, that irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) there, worried him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) and tormented him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). Chapter IX. The Devil. Ivan's Nightmare
<p/>but yet I feel that the moment has come when I must inevitably give the reader some account of the nature of Ivan's illness.
<p/>Anticipating events I can say at least one thing: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was at that moment on the very eve of an attack of brain fever.
<p/>Though his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) health had long been affected, it had offered a stubborn resistance to the fever which in the end gained complete mastery over it.
<p/>Though I know nothing of medicine, I venture to hazard the suggestion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) really had perhaps, by a terrible effort of will, succeeded in delaying the attack for a time, hoping, of course, to check it completely.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was unwell, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) loathed the thought of being ill at that fatal time, at the approaching crisis in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) life, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) needed to have all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) wits about him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), to say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had to say boldly and resolutely and <div class="bookquote">``to justify himself to himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had, however, consulted the new doctor, who had been brought from Moscow by a fantastic notion of Katerina Ivanovna's to which I have referred already.
<p/>After listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) and examining him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) the doctor came to the conclusion that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was actually suffering from some disorder of the brain, and was not at all surprised by an admission which Ivan had reluctantly made him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>I am not a doctor, ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Hallucinations are quite likely in your condition,'' the doctor opined, <div class="bookquote">``though it would be better to verify them ...
<p/>you must take steps at once, without a moment's delay, or things will go badly with you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the doctor</b></font>)</div>But Ivan did not follow this judicious advice and did not take to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) bed to be nursed.
<p/>I am walking about, so I am strong enough, if I drop, it'll be different then, any one may nurse me who likes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) decided, dismissing the subject.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was sitting almost conscious himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) delirium and, as I have said already, looking persistently at some object on the sofa against the opposite wall.
<p/>Some one appeared to be sitting there, though goodness knows how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had come in, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had not been in the room when Ivan came into it, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) return from Smerdyakov.
<p/>This was a person or, more accurately speaking, a Russian gentleman of a particular kind, no longer young, qui faisait la cinquantaine , as the French say, with rather long, still thick, dark hair, slightly streaked with gray and a small pointed beard.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was wearing a brownish reefer jacket, rather shabby, evidently made by a good tailor though, and of a fashion at least three years old, that had been discarded by smart and well-to-do people for the last two years.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) linen and his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) long scarf-like neck-tie were all such as are worn by people who aim at being stylish, but on closer inspection his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) linen was not over-clean and his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) wide scarf was very threadbare.
<p/>The visitor's check trousers were of excellent cut, but were too light in color and too tight for the present fashion.
<p/>'' His (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) soft fluffy white hat was out of keeping with the season. In brief there was every appearance of gentility on straitened means.
<p/>It looked as though the gentleman belonged to that class of idle landowners who used to flourish in the times of serfdom.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had unmistakably been, at some time, in good and fashionable society, had once had good connections, had possibly preserved them indeed, but, after a gay youth, becoming gradually impoverished on the abolition of serfdom, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had sunk into the position of a poor relation of the best class, wandering from one good old friend to another and received by them for his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) companionable and accommodating disposition and as being, after all, a gentleman who could be asked to sit down with any one, though, of course, not in a place of honor.
<p/>Such gentlemen of accommodating temper and dependent position, who can tell a story, take a hand at cards, and who have a distinct aversion for any duties that may be forced upon them, are usually solitary creatures, either bachelors or widowers.
<p/>Sometimes they have children, but if so, the children are always being brought up at a distance, at some aunt's, to whom these gentlemen never allude in good society, seeming ashamed of the relationship.
<p/>They gradually lose sight of their children altogether, though at intervals they receive a birthday or Christmas letter from them and sometimes even answer it.
<p/>The countenance of the unexpected visitor was not so much good-natured, as accommodating and ready to assume any amiable expression as occasion might arise.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had no watch, but he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had a tortoise-shell lorgnette on a black ribbon. On the middle finger of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) right hand was a massive gold ring with a cheap opal stone in it.
<p/>The visitor waited and sat exactly like a poor relation who had come down from his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) room to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) host company at tea, and was discreetly silent, seeing that his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) host was frowning and preoccupied.
<p/>Ivan was angrily silent and would not begin the conversation. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was ready for any affable conversation as soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) host should begin it.
<p/>All at once his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face expressed a sudden solicitude. '' I say,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) began to Ivan, <div class="bookquote">``excuse me , I only mention it to remind you.
<p/>You went to Smerdyakov's to find out about Katerina Ivanovna, but you came away without finding out anything about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), you probably forgot--''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>but it doesn't matter now, never mind, till to-morrow,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) muttered to himself, <div class="bookquote">``and you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) added, addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) visitor, <div class="bookquote">``I should have remembered that myself in a minute, for that was just what was tormenting me!
<p/>Why do you interfere, as if I should believe that you prompted me, and that I didn't remember it of myself?''
 (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div><p/>Ah, yes,'' broke from Ivan and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face grew gloomy with uneasiness. '' Yes, I'd forgotten ... <div class="bookquote">``Don't believe it then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, smiling amicably, <div class="bookquote">``what's the good of believing against your will?
<p/>Besides, proofs are no help to believing, especially material proofs. Thomas believed, not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) saw Christ risen, but because he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) wanted to believe, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) saw.
<p/>I am very fond of them ... only fancy, they imagine that they are serving the cause of religion, because the devils show them their horns from the other world.
<p/>Look at the spiritualists, for instance.... That, they say, is a material proof, so to speak, of the existence of another world.
<p/>The other world and material proofs, what next! And if you come to that, does proving there's a devil prove that there's a God?
<p/>I want to join an idealist society, I'll lead the opposition in it, I'll say I am a realist, but not a materialist, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan suddenly got up from the table. '' I seem to be delirious.... I am delirious, in fact, talk any nonsense you like, I don't care!
<p/>You won't drive me to fury, as you did last time. But I feel somehow ashamed.... I want to walk about the room....
<p/>I sometimes don't see you and don't even hear your voice as I did last time, but I always guess what you are prating, for it's I,
<p/>I myself speaking, not you . Only I don't know whether I was dreaming last time or whether I really saw you.
<p/>Ivan went into the corner, took a towel, and did as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said, and with a wet towel on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) head began walking up and down the room.
<p/>I'll wet a towel and put it on my head and perhaps you'll vanish into air. '' '' I am so glad you treat me so familiarly,'' the visitor began.
<p/>I am in good spirits now, though I've a pain in my forehead ... and in the top of my head ...
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fool,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>laughed Ivan, <div class="bookquote">``do you suppose I should stand on ceremony with you? only please don't talk philosophy, as you did last time.
<p/>If you can't take yourself off, talk of something amusing. Talk gossip, you are a poor relation, you ought to talk gossip.
<p/>What a nightmare to have! But I am not afraid of you. I'll get the better of you. I won't be taken to a mad-house!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/>'' C'est charmant , poor relation. Yes, I am in my natural shape. For what am I on earth but a poor relation?
<p/>By the way, I am listening to you and am rather surprised to find you are actually beginning to take me for something real, not simply your fancy, as you persisted in declaring last time--
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Never for one minute have I taken you for reality,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Ivan cried with a sort of fury. '' You are a lie, you are my illness, you are a phantom.
<p/>It's only that I don't know how to destroy you and I see I must suffer for a time. You are my hallucination.
<p/>You are the incarnation of myself, but only of one side of me ... of my thoughts and feelings, but only the nastiest and stupidest of them.
<p/>From that point of view you might be of interest to me, if only I had time to waste on you--''
<p/>When you flew out at Alyosha under the lamp-post this evening and shouted to him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), `You learnt it from him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) !
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, excuse me, I'll catch you. How do you know that he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) visits me?' you were thinking of me then.
<p/>So for one brief moment you did believe that I really exist,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>the gentleman laughed blandly. '' Yes, that was a moment of weakness ...
<p/>but I couldn't believe in you. I don't know whether I was asleep or awake last time. Perhaps I was only dreaming then and didn't see you really at all--
<p/>'' '' And why were you so surly with Alyosha just now? He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is a dear; I've treated him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) badly over Father Zossima.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk of Alyosha! How dare you, you flunkey!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan laughed again. '' You scold me, but you laugh--that's a good sign.
<p/>But you are ever so much more polite than you were last time and I know why: that great resolution of yours--'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't speak of my resolution,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried Ivan, savagely.
<p/>I understand, I understand, c'est noble, c'est charmant , you are going to defend your brother and to sacrifice yourself ...
<p/>'' C'est chevaleresque . '' <div class="bookquote">``Hold your tongue, I'll kick you!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I shan't be altogether sorry, for then my object will be attained.
<p/>Joking apart, it doesn't matter to me, scold if you like, though it's better to be a trifle more polite even to me. '
<p/>If you kick me, you must believe in my reality, for people don't kick ghosts. Fool, flunkey!' what words!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Scolding you, I scold myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan laughed again, <div class="bookquote">``you are myself, myself, only with a different face.
<p/>If I am like you in my way of thinking, it's all to my credit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>the gentleman declared, with delicacy and dignity.
<p/>You just say what I am thinking ... and are incapable of saying anything new!'' '' '' You choose out only my worst thoughts, and what's more, the stupid ones.
<p/>You are stupid and vulgar. You are awfully stupid. No, I can't put up with you! What am I to do, what am I to do?
<p/>My dear friend, above all things I want to behave like a gentleman and to be recognized as such,'' the visitor began in an excess of deprecating and simple-hearted pride, typical of a poor relation.
<p/>'' Ivan said through his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) clenched teeth. '' '' I am poor, but ... I won't say very honest, but ... it's an axiom generally accepted in society that I am a fallen angel.
<p/>I certainly can't conceive how I can ever have been an angel. If I ever was, it must have been so long ago that there's no harm in forgetting it.
<p/>Now I only prize the reputation of being a gentlemanly person and live as I can, trying to make myself agreeable.
<p/>Here when I stay with you from time to time, my life gains a kind of reality and that's what I like most of all.
<p/>I love men genuinely, I've been greatly calumniated! You see, like you, I suffer from the fantastic and so I love the realism of earth.
<p/>Here, with you, everything is circumscribed, here all is formulated and geometrical, while we have nothing but indeterminate equations! I wander about here dreaming.
<p/>I like dreaming. Besides, on earth I become superstitious. Please don't laugh , that's just what I like, to become superstitious.
<p/>I adopt all your habits here : I've grown fond of going to the public baths, would you believe it? and I go and steam myself with merchants and priests.
<p/>What I dream of is becoming incarnate once for all and irrevocably in the form of some merchant's wife weighing eighteen stone, and of believing all she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) believes.
<p/>My ideal is to go to church and offer a candle in simple-hearted faith, upon my word it is. Then there would be an end to my sufferings.
<p/>I like being doctored too; in the spring there was an outbreak of smallpox and I went and was vaccinated in a foundling hospital--if only you knew how I enjoyed myself that day.
<p/>I subscribed ten roubles in the cause of the Slavs!... But you are not listening. Do you know, you are not at all well this evening?
<p/>I know you went yesterday to that doctor ... well, what about your health? What did the doctor say?'' <div class="bookquote">``Fool!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan snapped out.
<p/>'' But you are clever, anyway. You are scolding again? I didn't ask out of sympathy. You needn't answer. Now rheumatism has come in again--'' <div class="bookquote">``Fool!
<p/>You keep saying the same thing; but I had such an attack of rheumatism last year that I remember it to this day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/>'' repeated Ivan. '' '' The devil have rheumatism!'' <div class="bookquote">``Why not, if I sometimes put on fleshly form? I put on fleshly form
<p/>and I take the consequences. Satan sum et nihil humanum a me alienum puto . ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What, what, Satan sum et nihil humanum ... that's not bad for the devil!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad I've pleased you at last.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' But you didn't get that from me. '' Ivan stopped suddenly, seeming struck.
<p/>'' That never entered my head, that's strange. '' '' C'est du nouveau, n'est-ce pas? This time I'll act honestly and explain to you.
<p/>Listen, in dreams and especially in nightmares, from indigestion or anything, a man sees sometimes such artistic visions, such complex and real actuality, such events, even a whole world of events, woven into such a plot, with such unexpected details from the most exalted matters to the last button on a cuff, as I swear Leo Tolstoy has never invented.
<p/>Yet such dreams are sometimes seen not by writers, but by the most ordinary people, officials, journalists, priests.... The subject is a complete enigma.
<p/>Well, that's how it is now, though I am your hallucination, yet just as in a nightmare, I say original things which had not entered your head before.
<p/>A statesman confessed to me, indeed, that all his (<font color='blue'><b>statesman</b></font>) best ideas came to him (<font color='blue'><b>statesman</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>statesman</b></font>) was asleep. So I don't repeat your ideas, yet I am only your nightmare, nothing more.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are lying, your aim is to convince me you exist apart and are not my nightmare, and now you are asserting you are a dream.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' My dear fellow, I've adopted a special method to-day, I'll explain it to you afterwards. Stay, where did I break off?
<p/>Oh, yes! I caught cold then, only not here but yonder. '' <div class="bookquote">``Where is yonder? Tell me, will you be here long?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) ceased walking to and fro, sat down on the sofa, leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) elbows on the table again and held his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) head tight in both hands.
<p/>Can't you go away?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan exclaimed almost in despair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) pulled the wet towel off and flung it away in vexation.
<p/>It was evidently of no use. '' Your nerves are out of order,'' observed the gentleman, with a carelessly easy, though perfectly polite, air.
<p/>'' You are angry with me even for being able to catch cold, though it happened in a most natural way.
<p/>I was hurrying then to a diplomatic soirée at the house of a lady of high rank in Petersburg, who was aiming at influence in the Ministry.
<p/>Well, an evening suit, white tie, gloves, though I was God knows where and had to fly through space to reach your earth....
<p/>Of course, it took only an instant, but you know a ray of light from the sun takes full eight minutes, and fancy in an evening suit and open waistcoat.
<p/>Spirits don't freeze, but when one's in fleshly form, well ... in brief, I didn't think, and set off, and you know in those ethereal spaces, in the water that is above the firmament, there's such a frost ... at least one can't call it frost, you can fancy, 150 degrees below zero!
<p/>You know the game the village girls play--they invite the unwary to lick an ax in thirty degrees of frost, the tongue instantly freezes to it and the dupe tears the skin off, so it bleeds.
<p/>But that's only in 30 degrees, in 150 degrees I imagine it would be enough to put your finger on the ax
<p/>and it would be the end of it ... if only there could be an ax there.'' '' And can there be an ax there?''
<p/>Ivan interrupted, carelessly and disdainfully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was exerting himself to the utmost not to believe in the delusion and not to sink into complete insanity.
<p/>'' An ax? '' the guest interrupted in surprise. '' Yes, what would become of an ax there?'' Ivan cried suddenly, with a sort of savage and insistent obstinacy.
<p/>If it were to fall to any distance, it would begin, I think, flying round the earth without knowing why, like a satellite.
<p/>The astronomers would calculate the rising and the setting of the ax, Gatzuk would put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) calendar, that's all.
<p/>'' What would become of an ax in space? Quelle idée! '' <div class="bookquote">``You are stupid, awfully stupid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Ivan peevishly. ''
<p/>You want to get the better of me by realism, to convince me that you exist, but I don't want to believe you exist!
<p/>Fib more cleverly or I won't listen. I won't believe it!'' '' But I am not fibbing, it's all the truth; the truth is unhappily hardly ever amusing.
<p/>I see you persist in expecting something big of me, and perhaps something fine. That's a great pity, for I only give what I can--''
<p/>I've tried all the medical faculty: they can diagnose beautifully, they have the whole of your disease at their finger-tips, but they've no idea how to cure you.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk philosophy, you ass!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Philosophy, indeed, when all my right side is numb and I am moaning and groaning. There was an enthusiastic little student here, `You may die,'
<p/>said he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>), `but you'll know perfectly what disease you are dying of!' And then what a way they have sending people to specialists! '
<p/>The old doctor who used to cure all sorts of disease has completely disappeared, I assure you, now there are only specialists and they all advertise in the newspapers.
<p/>If anything is wrong with your nose, they send you to Paris: there, they say, is a European specialist who cures noses.
<p/>If you go to Paris, he (<font color='blue'><b>specialist</b></font>)'ll look at your nose; I can only cure your right nostril, he (<font color='blue'><b>specialist</b></font>)'ll tell you, for I don't cure the left nostril, that's not my speciality, but go to Vienna, there there's a specialist who will cure your left nostril.
<p/>I fell back on popular remedies, a German doctor advised me to rub myself with honey and salt in the bath-house.
<p/>We only diagnose,' they say, `but go to such-and-such a specialist, he (<font color='blue'><b>specialist</b></font>)'ll cure you.' What are you to do? Solely to get an extra bath I went, smeared myself all over and it did me
<p/>no good at all. In despair I wrote to Count Mattei in Milan. He (<font color='blue'><b>specialist</b></font>) sent me a book and some drops, bless him (<font color='blue'><b>specialist</b></font>), and, only fancy, Hoff's malt extract cured me!
<p/>I bought it by accident, drank a bottle and a half of it, and I was ready to dance, it took it away completely.
<p/>I made up my mind to write to the papers to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Hoff</b></font>), I was prompted by a feeling of gratitude, and only fancy, it led to no end of a bother: not a single paper would take my letter. '
<p/>It would be very reactionary,' they said, `no one will believe it. Le diable n'existe point. You'd better remain anonymous,' they advised me.
<p/>What use is a letter of thanks if it's anonymous? I laughed with the men at the newspaper office; ' It's reactionary to believe in God in our days,' I said, '
<p/>but I am the devil, so I may be believed in.' ' We quite understand that,' they said. ' Who doesn't believe in the devil?
<p/>Yet it won't do, it might injure our reputation. As a joke, if you like.' But I thought as a joke it wouldn't be very witty.
<p/>So it wasn't printed. And do you know, I have felt sore about it to this day. My best feelings, gratitude, for instance, are literally denied me simply from my social position.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Philosophical reflections again?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan snarled malignantly. '' God preserve me from it, but one can't help complaining sometimes. I am a slandered man.
<p/>You upbraid me every moment with being stupid. One can see you are young. My dear fellow, intelligence isn't the only thing!
<p/>I have naturally a kind and merry heart. ' I also write vaudevilles of all sorts.' You seem to take me for Hlestakov grown old, but my fate is a far more serious one.
<p/>Before time was, by some decree which I could never make out, I was pre-destined `to deny' and yet I am genuinely good-hearted and not at all inclined to negation. '
<p/>No, you must go and deny, without denial there's no criticism and what would a journal be without a column of criticism?'
<p/>But nothing but hosannah is not enough for life, the hosannah must be tried in the crucible of doubt and so on, in the same style.
<p/>Without criticism it would be nothing but one `hosannah.' But I don't meddle in that , I didn't create it, I am not answerable for it.
<p/>Well, they've chosen their scapegoat, they've made me write the column of criticism and so life was made possible. We understand that comedy; I, for instance, simply ask for annihilation.
<p/>No, live, I am told, for there'd be nothing without you. If everything in the universe were sensible, nothing would happen.
<p/>There would be no events without you, and there must be events. So against the grain I serve to produce events and do what's irrational because I am commanded to.
<p/>For all their indisputable intelligence, men take this farce as something serious, and that is their tragedy. They suffer, of course ...
<p/>but then they live, they live a real life, not a fantastic one, for suffering is life. Without suffering what would be the pleasure of it?
<p/>It would be transformed into an endless church service; it would be holy, but tedious. But what about me? I suffer, but still, I don't live.
<p/>I am a sort of phantom in life who has lost all beginning and end, and who has even forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own name.
<p/>You are for ever angry, all you care about is intelligence, but I repeat again that I would give away all this super-stellar life, all the ranks and honors, simply to be transformed into the soul of a merchant's wife weighing eighteen stone and set candles at God's shrine.''
<p/>I am x in an indeterminate equation. You are laughing-- no, you are not laughing, you are angry again. <div class="bookquote">``Then even you don't believe in God?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Ivan, with a smile of hatred.
<p/>'' What can I say?--that is, if you are in earnest-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Is there a God or not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan cried with the same savage intensity.
<p/>'' Ah, then you are in earnest! My dear fellow, upon my word I don't know. There! I've said it now!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't know, but you see God? No, you are not some one apart, you are myself, you are I and nothing more!
<p/>You are rubbish, you are my fancy!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Well, if you like, I have the same philosophy as you, that would be true.
<p/>Je pense, donc je suis , I know that for a fact; all the rest, all these worlds, God and even Satan--all that is not proved, to my mind.
<p/>Does all that exist of itself, or is it only an emanation of myself, a logical development of my ego which alone has existed for ever: but I make haste to stop, for I believe you will be jumping up to beat me directly.
<p/>'' '' You'd better tell me some anecdote!'' said Ivan miserably. '' There is an anecdote precisely on our subject, or rather a legend, not an anecdote.
<p/>You reproach me with unbelief, you see, you say, yet you don't believe. But, my dear fellow, I am not the only one like that.
<p/>We are all in a muddle over there now and all through your science. Once there used to be atoms, five senses, four elements, and then everything hung together somehow.
<p/>There were atoms in the ancient world even, but since we've learned that you've discovered the chemical molecule and protoplasm and the devil knows what, we had to lower our crest.
<p/>There's a regular muddle, and, above all, superstition, scandal; there's as much scandal among us as among you, you know; a little more in fact, and spying, indeed, for we have our secret police department where private information is received.
<p/>Well, this wild legend belongs to our middle ages--not yours, but ours--and no one believes it even among us, except the old ladies of eighteen stone, not your old ladies I mean, but ours.
<p/>We've everything you have, I am revealing one of our secrets out of friendship for you; though it's forbidden. This legend is about Paradise.
<p/>There was, they say, here on earth a thinker and philosopher. He (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) rejected everything, `laws, conscience, faith,' and, above all, the future life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) died; he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) expected to go straight to darkness and death and he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) found a future life before him (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) was astounded and indignant. '
<p/>This is against my principles!' he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) said. And he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) was punished for that ... that is, you must excuse me, I am just repeating what I heard myself, it's only a legend ...
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) was sentenced to walk a quadrillion kilometers in the dark -LRB-we've adopted the metric system, you know-RRB- and when he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>) has finished that quadrillion, the gates of heaven would be opened to him (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>)
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>philosopher</b></font>)'ll be forgiven-- '' '' And what tortures have you in the other world besides the quadrillion kilometers? '' asked Ivan, with a strange eagerness.
<p/>In old days we had all sorts, but now they have taken chiefly to moral punishments--`the stings of conscience' and all that nonsense.
<p/>'' What tortures? Ah, don't ask. We got that, too, from you, from the softening of your manners. And who's the better for it?
<p/>Only those who have got no conscience, for how can they be tortured by conscience when they have none? But decent people who have conscience and a sense of honor suffer for it.
<p/>Reforms, when the ground has not been prepared for them, especially if they are institutions copied from abroad, do nothing but mischief!
<p/>Well, this man, who was condemned to the quadrillion kilometers, stood still, looked round and lay down across the road. '
<p/>Take the soul of an enlightened Russian atheist and mix it with the soul of the prophet Jonah, who sulked for three days and nights in the belly of the whale, and you get the character of that thinker who lay across the road.
<p/>The ancient fire was better. I won't go, I refuse on principle!' '' <div class="bookquote">``What did he (<font color='blue'><b>thinker</b></font>) lie on there?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Well, I suppose there was something to lie on.
<p/>You are not laughing?'' <div class="bookquote">``Bravo! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Ivan, still with the same strange eagerness. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) was listening with an unexpected curiosity.
<p/>'' Well, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) lying there now?'' '' That's the point, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) isn't. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) lay there almost a thousand years

<p/>'' Does it make any difference whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) lies there for ever or walks the quadrillion kilometers? It would take a billion years to walk it?
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Much more than that. I haven't got a pencil and paper or I could work it out. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) got there long ago, and that's where the story begins.

<p/>'' That anecdote about the quadrillion years, I made up myself! I was seventeen then, I was at the high school.
<p/>I made up that anecdote and told it to a schoolfellow called Korovkin, it was at Moscow.... The anecdote is so characteristic that I couldn't have taken it from anywhere.
<p/>Thousands of things are unconsciously remembered like that even when people are being taken to execution ... it's come back to me in a dream.

<p/>My dear fellow,'' observed the visitor sententiously, <div class="bookquote">``it's better to get off with your nose pulled than without a nose at all.
<p/>As an afflicted marquis observed not long ago -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) must have been treated by a specialist-RRB- in confession to his (<font color='blue'><b>marquis</b></font>) spiritual father--a Jesuit.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the visitor</b></font>)</div>'' Well, did you get your nose pulled?''-LRB-8-RRB- '' I was present, it was simply charming. ' Give me back my nose!'
<p/>My son,' said the priest evasively, `all things are accomplished in accordance with the inscrutable decrees of Providence, and what seems a misfortune sometimes leads to extraordinary, though unapparent, benefits.
<p/>If stern destiny has deprived you of your nose, it's to your advantage that no one can ever pull you by your nose.'
<p/>I'd be delighted to have my nose pulled every day of my life, if it were only in its proper place.' '
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) beat his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) breast. ' ' Holy father, that's no comfort,' cried the despairing marquis. ' My son,' sighs the priest, `you can't expect every blessing at once.
<p/>This is murmuring against Providence, who even in this has not forgotten you, for if you repine as you repined just now, declaring you'd be glad to have your nose pulled for the rest of your life, your desire has already been fulfilled indirectly, for when you lost your nose, you were led by the nose.' ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fool, how stupid!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Ivan. '' My dear friend, I only wanted to amuse you. But I swear that's the genuine Jesuit casuistry
<p/>and I swear that it all happened word for word as I've told you. It happened lately and gave me a great deal of trouble.
<p/>The unhappy young man shot himself that very night when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got home. I was by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side till the very last moment.
<p/>Those Jesuit confessionals are really my most delightful diversion at melancholy moments. Here's another incident that happened only the other day.
<p/>A little blonde Norman girl of twenty--a buxom, unsophisticated beauty that would make your mouth water--comes to an old priest. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bends down and whispers her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sin into the grating. '
<p/>Why, my daughter, have you fallen again already?' cries the priest. ' O Sancta Maria, what do I hear! Not the same man this time, how long is this going on?
<p/>Ah, mon pčre ,' answers the sinner with tears of penitence, ' ça lui fait tant de plaisir, et ŕ moi si peu de peine! '
<p/>Aren't you ashamed!' ' Fancy, such an answer! I drew back. It was the cry of nature, better than innocence itself, if you like.
<p/>I heard the priest at the grating making an appointment with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) for the evening--though he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was an old man hard as flint, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) fell in an instant!
<p/>I absolved her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sin on the spot and was turning to go, but I was forced to turn back. It was nature, the truth of nature asserted its rights!
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Leave me alone, you are beating on my brain like a haunting nightmare,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan moaned miserably, helpless before his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) apparition.
<p/>What, you are turning up your nose again? Angry again? I don't know how to please you-- '' I am bored with you, agonizingly and insufferably.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I repeat, moderate your expectations, don't demand of me `everything great and noble' and you'll see how well we shall get on,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman impressively.
<p/>You are really angry with me for not having appeared to you in a red glow, with thunder and lightning, with scorched wings, but have shown myself in such a modest form.
<p/>I would give anything to be able to shake you off!'' '' You are wounded, in the first place, in your esthetic feelings, and, secondly, in your pride.
<p/>How could such a vulgar devil visit such a great man as you! Yes, there is that romantic strain in you, that was so derided by Byelinsky.
<p/>I did think as a joke of appearing in the figure of a retired general who had served in the Caucasus, with a star of the Lion and the Sun on my coat.
<p/>But I was positively afraid of doing it, for you'd have thrashed me for daring to pin the Lion and the Sun on my coat, instead of, at least, the Polar Star or the Sirius.
<p/>I can't help it, young man, as I got ready to come to you And you keep on saying I am stupid, but, mercy on us!
<p/>I make no claim to be equal to you in intelligence. Mephistopheles declared to Faust that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desired evil, but did only good.
<p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can say what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes, it's quite the opposite with me. I am perhaps the one man in all creation who loves the truth and genuinely desires good.
<p/>I was there when the Word, Who died on the Cross, rose up into heaven bearing on His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bosom the soul of the penitent thief.
<p/>I heard the glad shrieks of the cherubim singing and shouting hosannah and the thunderous rapture of the seraphim which shook heaven and all creation, and I swear to you by all that's sacred, I longed to join the choir and shout hosannah with them all.
<p/>The word had almost escaped me, had almost broken from my lips ... you know how susceptible and esthetically impressionable I am.
<p/>But common sense--oh, a most unhappy trait in my character--kept me in due bounds and I let the moment pass! For what would have happened, I reflected, what would have happened after my hosannah?
<p/>And so, solely from a sense of duty and my social position, I was forced to suppress the good moment and to stick to my nasty task.
<p/>Everything on earth would have been extinguished at once and no events could have occurred. Somebody takes all the credit of what's good for Himself, and nothing but nastiness is left for me.
<p/>Why am I, of all creatures in the world, doomed to be cursed by all decent people and even to be kicked, for if I put on mortal form I am bound to take such consequences sometimes?
<p/>I know, of course, there's a secret in it, but they won't tell me the secret for anything, for then perhaps, seeing the meaning of it, I might bawl hosannah, and the indispensable minus would disappear at once, and good sense would reign supreme throughout the whole world.
<p/>And that, of course, would mean the end of everything, even of magazines and newspapers, for who would take them in?
<p/>But I don't envy the honor of a life of idle imposture, I am not ambitious. I know that at the end of all things I shall be reconciled.
<p/>But till that happens I am sulking and fulfill my destiny though it's against the grain--that is, to ruin thousands for the sake of saving one.
<p/>How many souls have had to be ruined and how many honorable reputations destroyed for the sake of that one righteous man, Job, over whom they made such a fool of me in old days!
<p/>Yes, till the secret is revealed, there are two sorts of truths for me--one, their truth, yonder, which I know nothing about so far, and the other my own.
<p/>I, too, shall walk my quadrillion and learn the secret. And there's no knowing which will turn out the better.... Are you asleep?''
<p/>All my stupid ideas--outgrown, thrashed out long ago, and flung aside like a dead carcass--you present to me as something new!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I might well be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan groaned angrily. '' '' There's no pleasing you! And I thought I should fascinate you by my literary style.
<p/>That hosannah in the skies really wasn't bad, was it? And then that ironical tone ŕ la Heine, eh?'' '' No, I was never such a flunkey!
<p/>My dear fellow, I know a most charming and attractive young Russian gentleman, a young thinker and a great lover of literature and art, the author of a promising poem entitled The Grand Inquisitor .
<p/>How then could my soul beget a flunkey like you?'' '' I was only thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>)!'' <div class="bookquote">``I forbid you to speak of The Grand Inquisitor ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Ivan, crimson with shame.

<p/>There are new men,' you decided last spring, when you were meaning to come here, `they propose to destroy everything and begin with cannibalism.
<p/>I maintain that nothing need be destroyed, that we only need to destroy the idea of God in man, that's how we have to set to work.
<p/>Stupid fellows! they didn't ask my advice! It's that, that we must begin with. Oh, blind race of men who have no understanding!
<p/>As soon as men have all of them denied God--and I believe that period, analogous with geological periods, will come to pass--the old conception of the universe will fall of itself without cannibalism, and, what's more, the old morality, and everything will begin anew.
<p/>Men will unite to take from life all it can give, but only for joy and happiness in the present world.
<p/>From hour to hour extending his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) conquest of nature infinitely by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) science, man will feel such lofty joy from hour to hour in doing it that it will make up for all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) old dreams of the joys of heaven.
<p/>Man will be lifted up with a spirit of divine Titanic pride and the man- god will appear. Every one will know that he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) is mortal and will accept death proudly and serenely like a god.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) pride will teach him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) that it's useless for him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) to repine at life's being a moment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) will love his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) brother without need of reward.
<p/>Love will be sufficient only for a moment of life, but the very consciousness of its momentariness will intensify its fire, which now is dissipated in dreams of eternal love beyond the grave'... and so on and so on in the same style.
<p/>Ivan sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) eyes on the floor, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hands pressed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) ears, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) began trembling all over.
<p/>Charming!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The voice continued. '' The question now is, my young thinker reflected, is it possible that such a period will ever come?
<p/>But as, owing to man's inveterate stupidity, this cannot come about for at least a thousand years, every one who recognizes the truth even now may legitimately order his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleases, on the new principles.
<p/>If it does, everything is determined and humanity is settled for ever. In that sense, `all things are lawful' for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>What's more, even if this period never comes to pass, since there is anyway no God and no immortality, the new man may well become the man-god, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is the only one in the whole world, and promoted to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) new position, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) may lightheartedly overstep all the barriers of the old morality of the old slave-man, if necessary.
<p/>There is no law for God. Where God stands, the place is holy. Where I stand will be at once the foremost place ... '
<p/>all things are lawful' and that's the end of it! That's all very charming; but if you want to swindle why do you want a moral sanction for doing it?
<p/>But that's our modern Russian all over. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) can't bring himself to swindle without a moral sanction. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is so in love with truth--''
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not succeed in finishing; Ivan suddenly snatched a glass from the table and flung it at the orator.
<p/>The visitor talked, obviously carried away by his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) own eloquence, speaking louder and louder and looking ironically at his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) host. ''
<p/>Ah, mais c'est bęte enfin ,'' cried the latter, jumping up from the sofa and shaking the drops of tea off himself.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) remembers Luther's inkstand! He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) takes me for a dream and throws glasses at a dream! It's like a woman!
<p/>I suspected you were only pretending to stop up your ears. '' A loud, persistent knocking was suddenly heard at the window.
<p/>Ivan jumped up from the sofa. '' Do you hear? You'd better open,'' cried the visitor; <div class="bookquote">``it's your brother Alyosha with the most interesting and surprising news, I'll be bound!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the visitor</b></font>)</div><p/>, I felt he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was coming, and of course he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has not come for nothing; of course he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) brings `news,' '' Ivan exclaimed frantically.

<p/>Monsieur sait-il le temps qu'il fait? C'est ŕ ne pas mettre un chien dehors . '' The knocking continued. Ivan wanted to rush to the window, but something seemed to fetter his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) arms and legs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) strained every effort to break his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) chains, but in vain. The knocking at the window grew louder and louder. At last the chains were broken and Ivan leapt up from the sofa.
<p/>Both candles had almost burnt out, the glass he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had just thrown at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) visitor stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) on the table, and there was no one on the sofa opposite.
<p/>The knocking on the window frame went on persistently, but it was by no means so loud as it had seemed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) dream; on the contrary, it was quite subdued.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) looked round him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) wildly. '' It was not a dream! No, I swear it was not a dream, it all happened just now!'' cried Ivan.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) rushed to the window and opened the movable pane. '' Alyosha, I told you not to come,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) cried fiercely to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother.
<p/>'' In two words, what do you want? In two words, do you hear?'' <div class="bookquote">``An hour ago Smerdyakov hanged himself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha answered from the yard.

<p/>It Was He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) '' I went in to clear away the samovar and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was hanging on a nail in the wall.
<p/>On Alyosha's inquiring whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Kondratyevna</b></font>) had informed the police, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kondratyevna</b></font>) answered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kondratyevna</b></font>) had told no one, <div class="bookquote">``but I flew straight to you, I've run all the way.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had not taken his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) eyes off him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) story, as though struck by something in his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) expression.
<p/>'' And from him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) I've come straight to you,'' said Alyosha, in conclusion, looking intently into Ivan's face. '' Brother,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) cried suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``you must be terribly ill.
<p/>You look and don't seem to understand what I tell you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' It's a good thing you came,'' said Ivan, as though brooding, and not hearing Alyosha's exclamation.
<p/>'' I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had hanged himself. '' <div class="bookquote">``From whom?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. But I knew. Did I know? Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) told me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) told me so just now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan stood in the middle of the room, and still spoke in the same brooding tone, looking at the ground.
<p/>'' Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) ? '' asked Alyosha, involuntarily looking round. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s slipped away. '' Ivan raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) head and smiled softly.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was afraid of you, of a dove like you. You are a `pure cherub.' Dmitri calls you a cherub.
<p/>Cherub! ... the thunderous rapture of the seraphim. What are seraphim? Perhaps a whole constellation. But perhaps that constellation is only a chemical molecule.
<p/>There's a constellation of the Lion and the Sun. Don't you know it?'' '' Brother, sit down,'' said Alyosha in alarm.
<p/>'' For goodness' sake, sit down on the sofa! You are delirious; put your head on the pillow, that's right. Would you like a wet towel on your head?
<p/>Perhaps it will do you good.'' <div class="bookquote">``Give me the towel: it's here on the chair. I just threw it down there.
<p/>I know where it is--here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha, finding a clean towel, folded up and unused, by Ivan's dressing- table in the other corner of the room.
<p/>'' '' It's not here. Don't worry yourself. Ivan looked strangely at the towel: recollection seemed to come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) for an instant.
<p/>'' Stay''--he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) got up from the sofa--<div class="bookquote">``an hour ago I took that new towel from there and wetted it. I wrapped it round my head and threw it down here ...
<p/>How is it it's dry? There was no other.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' You put that towel on your head?'' asked Alyosha. '' Yes, and walked up and down the room an hour ago ...
<p/>Why have the candles burnt down so? What's the time?'' '' Nearly twelve.'' <div class="bookquote">``No, no, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Ivan cried suddenly. '' It was not a dream.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was here; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was sitting here, on that sofa. When you knocked at the window, I threw a glass at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) ... this one.
<p/>Wait a minute. I was asleep last time, but this dream was not a dream. It has happened before. I have dreams now, Alyosha ... yet they are not dreams, but reality.
<p/>I walk about, talk and see ... though I am asleep. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was sitting here, on that sofa there.... He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is frightfully stupid, Alyosha, frightfully stupid.
<p/>'' Ivan laughed suddenly and began pacing about the room. '' Who is stupid? Of whom are you talking, brother?'' Alyosha asked anxiously again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) taunted me with being angry at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) being a simple devil and not Satan, with scorched wings, in thunder and lightning.
<p/>'' The devil! He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)'s taken to visiting me. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)'s been here twice, almost three times. But he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) is not Satan: that's a lie.
<p/>If you undressed him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), you'd be sure to find he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had a tail, long and smooth like a Danish dog's, a yard long, dun color....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) is an impostor. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) is simply a devil--a paltry, trivial devil. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) goes to the baths. Alyosha, you are cold.
<p/>You've been in the snow. Would you like some tea? What? Is it cold? Shall I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to bring some?
<p/>Alyosha ran to the washing-stand, wetted the towel, persuaded Ivan to sit down again, and put the wet towel round his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) head.
<p/>C'est ŕ ne pas mettre un chien dehors. ... '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) sat down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). '' What were you telling me just now about Lise?''
<p/>Ivan began again. -LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was becoming very talkative.-RRB- '' I like Lise. I said something nasty about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>). It was a lie.
<p/>I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) ... I am afraid for Katya to-morrow. I am more afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) than of anything. On account of the future.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) will cast me off to-morrow and trample me under foot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) thinks that I am ruining Mitya from jealousy on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) account!
<p/>Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lise</b></font>) thinks that! But it's not so. To-morrow the cross, but not the gallows. No, I shan't hang myself. Do you know, I can never commit suicide, Alyosha.
<p/>Is it because I am base? I am not a coward. Is it from love of life? How did I know that Smerdyakov had hanged himself?
<p/>Yes, it was he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) told me so.'' '' And you are quite convinced that there has been some one here?'' asked Alyosha.
<p/>'' Yes, on that sofa in the corner. You would have driven him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) away. You did drive him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) away: he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) disappeared when you arrived.
<p/>I love your face, Alyosha. Did you know that I loved your face? And he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) is myself, Alyosha. All that's base in me, all that's mean and contemptible.
<p/>Yes, I am a romantic. He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) guessed it ... though it's a libel. He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) is frightfully stupid; but it's to his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) advantage.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) has cunning, animal cunning--he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) knew how to infuriate me. He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) kept taunting me with believing in him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>), and that was how he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) made me listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) fooled me like a boy. He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) told me a great deal that was true about myself, though. I should never have owned it to myself.
<p/>Do you know, Alyosha,'' Ivan added in an intensely earnest and confidential tone, <div class="bookquote">``I should be awfully glad to think that it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) and not I.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) has worn you out,'' said Alyosha, looking compassionately at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'s been teasing me. And you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) does it so cleverly, so cleverly. '
<p/>Conscience! What is conscience? I make it up for myself. Why am I tormented by it? From habit. From the universal habit of mankind for the seven thousand years.
<p/>So let us give it up, and we shall be gods.' It was he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said that, it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said that!''
<p/>'' And not you, not you? '' Alyosha could not help crying, looking frankly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother. '' Never mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), anyway; have done with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) and forget him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>).
<p/>And let him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) take with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) all that you curse now, and never come back!'' '' Yes, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is spiteful.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) laughed at me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was impudent, Alyosha,'' Ivan said, with a shudder of offense. '' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was unfair to me, unfair to me about lots of things.
<p/>Oh, you are going to perform an act of heroic virtue: to confess you murdered your father, that the valet murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at your instigation.' ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told lies about me to my face. ' '' Brother,'' Alyosha interposed, <div class="bookquote">``restrain yourself. It was not you murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>).
<p/>You are going to perform an act of heroic virtue, and you don't believe in virtue; that's what tortures you and makes you angry, that's why you are so vindictive.'
<p/>It's not true!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>'' That's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) says, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) knows it. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) said that to me about me
<p/>It's you say that, not he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>),'' exclaimed Alyosha mournfully, <div class="bookquote">``and you say it because you are ill and delirious, tormenting yourself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) knows what he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) says. '' '' '' No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) knows what he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) says. ' You are going from pride,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) says. '
<p/>You'll stand up and say it was I killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>), and why do you writhe with horror? You are lying! I despise your opinion, I despise your horror!'
<p/>And do you know you are longing for their praise--<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) is a criminal, a murderer, but what a generous soul; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) wanted to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) brother and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) confessed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) said that about me. ' ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>' That's a lie, Alyosha!'' Ivan cried suddenly, with flashing eyes. '' I don't want the low rabble to praise me, I swear I don't!
<p/>That's a lie! That's why I threw the glass at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) and it broke against his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) ugly face.'' '' Brother, calm yourself, stop!''
<p/>Alyosha entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>). '' Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) knows how to torment one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>)'s cruel,'' Ivan went on, unheeding. '' I had an inkling from the first what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) came for. '
<p/>Granting that you go through pride, still you had a hope that Smerdyakov might be convicted and sent to Siberia, and Mitya would be acquitted, while you would only be punished with moral condemnation' -LRB-`Do you hear?'
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) laughed then-RRB---`and some people will praise you. But now Smerdyakov's dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) has hanged himself, and who'll believe you alone?
<p/>But yet you are going, you are going, you'll go all the same, you've decided to go. What are you going for now?'
<p/>That's awful, Alyosha. I can't endure such questions. Who dare ask me such questions?'' '' Brother,'' interposed Alyosha--his (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) heart sank with terror, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) still seemed to hope to bring Ivan to reason--<div class="bookquote">``how
<p/>could he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) have told you of Smerdyakov's death before I came, when no one knew of it and there was no time for any one to know of it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) told me,'' said Ivan firmly, refusing to admit a doubt. '' It was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) did talk about, if you come to that. '
<p/>And it would be all right if you believed in virtue,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) said. ' No matter if they disbelieve you, you are going for the sake of principle.
<p/>But you are a little pig like Fyodor Pavlovitch, and what do you want with virtue? Why do you want to go meddling if your sacrifice is of no use to any one?
<p/>Because you don't know yourself why you go! Oh, you'd give a great deal to know yourself why you go! And can you have made up your mind?
<p/>You've not made up your mind. You'll sit all night deliberating whether to go or not. But you will go; you know you'll go.
<p/>You know that whichever way you decide, the decision does not depend on you. You'll go because you won't dare not to go.
<p/>Why won't you dare? You must guess that for yourself. That's a riddle for you!' He (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) got up and went away.
<p/>You came and he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) went. He (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) called me a coward, Alyosha! Le mot de l'énigme is that I am a coward. '
<p/>It is not for such eagles to soar above the earth.' It was he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) added that--he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>)! And Smerdyakov said the same.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) must be killed! Katya despises me. I've seen that for a month past. Even Lise will begin to despise me! '
<p/>You are going in order to be praised.' That's a brutal lie! And you despise me too, Alyosha. Now I am going to hate you again!
<p/>And I hate the monster, too! I hate the monster! I don't want to save the monster. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) rot in Siberia!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>)'s begun singing a hymn! Oh, to-morrow I'll go, stand before them, and spit in their faces!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) jumped up in a frenzy, flung off the towel, and fell to pacing up and down the room again.
<p/>Alyosha recalled what he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) had just said. '' I seem to be sleeping awake.... I walk, I speak, I see, but I am asleep.
<p/>'' It seemed to be just like that now. Alyosha did not leave him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>). The thought passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) mind to run for a doctor, but he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) was afraid to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) brother alone
<p/>: there was no one to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>) could leave him (<font color='blue'><b>coward</b></font>). By degrees Ivan lost consciousness completely at last. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) still went on talking, talking incessantly, but quite incoherently, and even articulated his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) words with difficulty.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) staggered violently; but Alyosha was in time to support him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). Ivan let him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) lead him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) bed. Alyosha undressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) somehow and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) to bed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) sat watching over him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) for another two hours. The sick man slept soundly, without stirring, breathing softly and evenly. Alyosha took a pillow and lay down on the sofa, without undressing.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell asleep he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prayed for Mitya and Ivan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) began to understand Ivan's illness. '' The anguish of a proud determination.
<p/>An earnest conscience! '' God, in Whom he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) disbelieved, and His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) truth were gaining mastery over his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heart, which still refused to submit.
<p/>Yes,'' the thought floated through Alyosha's head as it lay on the pillow, <div class="bookquote">``yes, if Smerdyakov is dead, no one will believe Ivan's evidence; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) will go and give it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) will either rise up in the light of truth, or ... he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>)'ll perish in hate, revenging on himself and on every one his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) having served the cause he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) does not believe in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha added bitterly, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) prayed for Ivan.
<p/>'' '' Alyosha smiled softly. '' God will conquer! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought. '' Book XII. A Judicial Error Chapter I. The Fatal Day
<p/>At ten o'clock in the morning of the day following the events I have described, the trial of Dmitri Karamazov began in our district court.
<p/>I hasten to emphasize the fact that I am far from esteeming myself capable of reporting all that took place at the trial in full detail, or even in the actual order of events.
<p/>I imagine that to mention everything with full explanation would fill a volume, even a very large one. And so I trust I may not be reproached, for confining myself to what struck me.
<p/>I may have selected as of most interest what was of secondary importance, and may have omitted the most prominent and essential details.
<p/>But I see I shall do better not to apologize. I will do my best and the reader will see for himself that I have done all I can.
<p/>And, to begin with, before entering the court, I will mention what surprised me most on that day. Indeed, as it appeared later, every one was surprised at it, too.
<p/>We all knew that the affair had aroused great interest, that every one was burning with impatience for the trial to begin, that it had been a subject of talk, conjecture, exclamation and surmise for the last two months in local society.
<p/>Every one knew, too, that the case had become known throughout Russia, but yet we had not imagined that it had aroused such burning, such intense, interest in every one, not only among ourselves, but all over Russia.
<p/>Visitors had arrived not only from the chief town of our province, but from several other Russian towns, as well as from Moscow and Petersburg.
<p/>This became evident at the trial this day. Among them were lawyers, ladies, and even several distinguished personages. Every ticket of admission had been snatched up.
<p/>A special place behind the table at which the three judges sat was set apart for the most distinguished and important of the men visitors; a row of arm-chairs had been placed there--something exceptional, which had never been allowed before.
<p/>There was such a large number of lawyers from all parts that they did not know where to seat them, for every ticket had long since been eagerly sought for and distributed.
<p/>I saw at the end of the room, behind the platform, a special partition hurriedly put up, behind which all these lawyers were admitted, and they thought themselves lucky to have standing room there, for all chairs had been removed for the sake of space, and the crowd behind the partition stood throughout the case closely packed, shoulder to shoulder.
<p/>Some of the ladies, especially those who came from a distance, made their appearance in the gallery very smartly dressed, but the majority of the ladies were oblivious even of dress.
<p/>A peculiar fact--established afterwards by many observations--was that almost all the ladies, or, at least the vast majority of them, were on Mitya's side and in favor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) being acquitted.
<p/>A large proportion--not less than half of the public--were ladies. Their faces betrayed hysterical, intense, almost morbid, curiosity. This was perhaps chiefly owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) reputation as a conqueror of female hearts.
<p/>It was known that two women rivals were to appear in the case. One of them--Katerina Ivanovna--was an object of general interest.
<p/>All sorts of extraordinary tales were told about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), amazing anecdotes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) passion for Mitya, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) crime.
<p/>People said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) intended to petition the Government for leave to accompany the criminal to Siberia and to be married to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) somewhere in the mines.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) pride and <div class="bookquote">``aristocratic connections''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>were particularly insisted upon -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had called upon scarcely any one in the town-RRB-. The appearance of Grushenka in court was awaited with no less impatience.
<p/>The public was looking forward with anxious curiosity to the meeting of the two rivals--the proud aristocratic girl and ``the hetaira.
<p/>They had already seen <div class="bookquote">``the woman who had ruined Fyodor Pavlovitch and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) unhappy son,''  (<font color='red'><b>father son</b></font>)</div>and all, almost without exception, wondered how father and son could be so in love with <div class="bookquote">``such a very common, ordinary Russian girl, who was not even pretty.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>But Grushenka was a more familiar figure to the ladies of the district than Katerina Ivanovna. '' In brief, there was a great deal of talk.
<p/>Many ladies quarreled violently with their husbands over differences of opinion about the dreadful case, and it was only natural that the husbands of these ladies, far from being favorably disposed to the prisoner, should enter the court bitterly prejudiced against him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
<p/>In fact, one may say pretty certainly that the masculine, as distinguished from the feminine, part of the audience were biased against the prisoner.
<p/>I know for a fact that there were several serious family quarrels on Mitya's account in our town. There were numbers of severe, frowning, even vindictive faces.
<p/>Mitya, indeed, had managed to offend many people during his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) stay in the town. Some of the visitors were, of course, in excellent spirits and quite unconcerned as to the fate of Mitya personally.
<p/>But all were interested in the trial, and the majority of the men were certainly hoping for the conviction of the criminal, except perhaps the lawyers, who were more interested in the legal than in the moral aspect of the case.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) talent was well known, and this was not the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had defended notorious criminal cases in the provinces.
<p/>Everybody was excited at the presence of the celebrated lawyer, Fetyukovitch. And if he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) defended them, such cases became celebrated and long remembered all over Russia.
<p/>It was said that Ippolit Kirillovitch was in a tremor at meeting Fetyukovitch, and that they had been enemies from the beginning of their careers in Petersburg, that though our sensitive prosecutor, who always considered that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had been aggrieved by some one in Petersburg because his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) talents had not been properly appreciated, was keenly excited over the Karamazov case, and was even dreaming of rebuilding his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) flagging fortunes by means of it, Fetyukovitch, they said, was his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) one anxiety.
<p/>There were stories, too, about our prosecutor and about the President of the Court. But these rumors were not quite just.
<p/>Our prosecutor was not one of those men who lose heart in face of danger. On the contrary, his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) self-confidence increased with the increase of danger.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) would put his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) whole soul into some case and work at it as though his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) whole fate and his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) whole fortune depended on its result.
<p/>This was the subject of some ridicule in the legal world, for just by this characteristic our prosecutor had gained a wider notoriety than could have been expected from his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) modest position.
<p/>It must be noted that our prosecutor was in general too hasty and morbidly impressionable. People laughed particularly at his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) passion for psychology.
<p/>In my opinion, they were wrong, and our prosecutor was, I believe, a character of greater depth than was generally supposed.
<p/>But with his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) delicate health he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had failed to make his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mark at the outset of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) career and had never made up for it later.
<p/>As for the President of our Court, I can only say that he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) was a humane and cultured man, who had a practical knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) work and progressive views.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) was rather ambitious, but did not concern himself greatly about his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) future career. The great aim of his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) life was to be a man of advanced ideas.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) felt, as we learnt afterwards, rather strongly about the Karamazov case, but from a social, not from a personal standpoint.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) was interested in it as a social phenomenon, in its classification and its character as a product of our social conditions, as typical of the national character, and so on, and so on.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) attitude to the personal aspect of the case, to its tragic significance and the persons involved in it, including the prisoner, was rather indifferent and abstract, as was perhaps fitting, indeed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was, too, a man of connections and property. The court was packed and overflowing long before the judges made their appearance.
<p/>On the right of the judges, who were on a raised platform, a table and two rows of chairs had been put ready for the jury.
<p/>Our court is the best hall in the town--spacious, lofty, and good for sound. On the left was the place for the prisoner and the counsel for the defense.
<p/>On it lay Fyodor Pavlovitch's white silk dressing-gown, stained with blood; the fatal brass pestle with which the supposed murder had been committed; Mitya's shirt, with a blood-stained sleeve; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) coat, stained with blood in patches over the pocket in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had put his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) handkerchief; the handkerchief itself, stiff with blood and by now quite yellow; the pistol loaded by Mitya at Perhotin's with a view to suicide, and taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) on the sly at Mokroe by Trifon Borissovitch; the envelope in which the three thousand roubles had been put ready for Grushenka, the narrow pink ribbon with which it had been tied, and many other articles I don't remember.
<p/>In the middle of the court, near the judges, was a table with the <div class="bookquote">``material proofs. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the judges</b></font>)</div>In the body of the hall, at some distance, came the seats for the public.
<p/>But in front of the balustrade a few chairs had been placed for witnesses who remained in the court after giving their evidence.
<p/>At ten o'clock the three judges arrived--the President, one honorary justice of the peace, and one other. The prosecutor, of course, entered immediately after.
<p/>The President was a short, stout, thick-set man of fifty, with a dyspeptic complexion, dark hair turning gray and cut short, and a red ribbon, of what Order I don't remember.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) face seemed to have grown suddenly thinner, perhaps in a single night, for I had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) looking as usual only two days before.
<p/>The prosecutor struck me and the others, too, as looking particularly pale, almost green. The President began with asking the court whether all the jury were present.
<p/>But I see I can't go on like this, partly because some things I did not hear, others I did not notice, and others I have forgotten, but most of all because, as I have said before, I have literally no time or space to mention everything that was said and done.
<p/>I remember the twelve jurymen--four were petty officials of the town, two were merchants, and six peasants and artisans of the town.
<p/>I remember, long before the trial, questions were continually asked with some surprise, especially by ladies: <div class="bookquote">``Can such a delicate, complex and psychological case be submitted for decision to petty officials and even peasants?''  (<font color='red'><b>ladies</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``What can an official, still more a peasant, understand in such an affair?
<p/>I only know that neither side objected to very many of the jurymen. ''  (<font color='red'><b>ladies</b></font>)</div>All the four officials in the jury were, in fact, men of no consequence and of low rank.
<p/>Except one who was rather younger, they were gray-headed men, little known in society, who had vegetated on a pitiful salary, and who probably had elderly, unpresentable wives and crowds of children, perhaps even without shoes and stockings.
<p/>At most, they spent their leisure over cards and, of course, had never read a single book. The two merchants looked respectable, but were strangely silent and stolid.
<p/>One of them was close-shaven, and was dressed in European style; the other had a small, gray beard, and wore a red ribbon with some sort of a medal upon it on his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) neck.
<p/>There is no need to speak of the artisans and the peasants. The artisans of Skotoprigonyevsk are almost peasants, and even work on the land.
<p/>So that one might well wonder, as I did as soon as I had looked at them, <div class="bookquote">``what men like that could possibly make of such a case?
<p/>Two of them also wore European dress, and, perhaps for that reason, were dirtier and more uninviting-looking than the others. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Yet their faces made a strangely imposing, almost menacing, impression; they were stern and frowning. At last the President opened the case of the murder of Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov.
<p/>I don't quite remember how he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) described him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>). The court usher was told to bring in the prisoner, and Mitya made his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) appearance.
<p/>There was a hush through the court. One could have heard a fly. I don't know how it was with others, but Mitya made a most unfavorable impression on me.
<p/>I heard afterwards that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had ordered it in Moscow expressly for the occasion from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) own tailor, who had his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) measure.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) walked in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) yard-long strides, looking stiffly straight in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), and sat down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) place with a most unperturbed air.
<p/>At the same moment the counsel for defense, the celebrated Fetyukovitch, entered, and a sort of subdued hum passed through the court.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) was a tall, spare man, with long thin legs, with extremely long, thin, pale fingers, clean-shaven face, demurely brushed, rather short hair, and thin lips that were at times curved into something between a sneer and a smile.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) looked an awful dandy in a brand-new frock-coat. He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) wore immaculate black kid gloves and exquisite linen. He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) looked about forty.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) face would have been pleasant, if it had not been for his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) eyes, which, in themselves small and inexpressive, were set remarkably close together, with only the thin, long nose as a dividing line between them.
<p/>In fact, there was something strikingly birdlike about his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) was in evening dress and white tie. I remember the President's first questions to Mitya, about his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) name, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) calling, and so on.
<p/>Mitya answered sharply, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) voice was so unexpectedly loud that it made the President start and look at the prisoner with surprise.
<p/>Then followed a list of persons who were to take part in the proceedings--that is, of the witnesses and experts. It was a long list.
<p/>Four of the witnesses were not present--Miüsov, who had given evidence at the preliminary inquiry, but was now in Paris; Madame Hohlakov and Maximov, who were absent through illness; and Smerdyakov, through his (<font color='blue'><b>Maximov</b></font>) sudden death, of which an official statement from the police was presented.
<p/>The news of Smerdyakov's death produced a sudden stir and whisper in the court. Many of the audience, of course, had not heard of the sudden suicide.
<p/>What struck people most was Mitya's sudden outburst As soon as the statement of Smerdyakov's death was made, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cried out aloud from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) place:
<p/>I remember how his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) counsel rushed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), and how the President addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>), threatening to take stern measures, if such an irregularity were repeated.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) was a dog and died like a dog! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya nodded and in a subdued voice repeated several times abruptly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) counsel, with no show of regret:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I won't again, I won't. It escaped me. I won't do it again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>counsel</b></font>)</div>And, of course, this brief episode did him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) no good with the jury or the public.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) character was displayed, and it spoke for itself. It was under the influence of this incident that the opening statement was read.
<p/>It was rather short, but circumstantial. It only stated the chief reasons why he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had been arrested, why he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) must be tried, and so on.
<p/>Yet it made a great impression on me. The clerk read it loudly and distinctly. The whole tragedy was suddenly unfolded before us, concentrated, in bold relief, in a fatal and pitiless light.
<p/>I remember how, immediately after it had been read, the President asked Mitya in a loud impressive voice: <div class="bookquote">``Prisoner, do you plead guilty?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya suddenly rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seat. '' I plead guilty to drunkenness and dissipation,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) exclaimed, again in a startling, almost frenzied, voice, <div class="bookquote">``to idleness and debauchery.
<p/>I meant to become an honest man for good, just at the moment when I was struck down by fate. But I am not guilty of the death of that old man, my enemy and my father.
<p/>No, no, I am not guilty of robbing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)! I could not be. Dmitri Karamazov is a scoundrel, but not a thief.
<p/>The President again briefly, but impressively, admonished him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) to answer only what was asked, and not to go off into irrelevant exclamations.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) sat down again, visibly trembling all over. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) ordered the case to proceed. All the witnesses were led up to take the oath.
<p/>Then I saw them all together. The brothers of the prisoner were, however, allowed to give evidence without taking the oath.
<p/>After an exhortation from the priest and the President, the witnesses were led away and were made to sit as far as possible apart from one another.
<p/>I do not know whether the witnesses for the defense and for the prosecution were separated into groups by the President, and whether it was arranged to call them in a certain order.
<p/>Then they began calling them up one by one. Chapter II. Dangerous Witnesses But no doubt it was so. I only know that the witnesses for the prosecution were called first.
<p/>Besides, my account would be to some extent superfluous, because in the speeches for the prosecution and for the defense the whole course of the evidence was brought together and set in a strong and significant light, and I took down parts of those two remarkable speeches in full, and will quote them in due course, together with one extraordinary and quite unexpected episode, which occurred before the final speeches, and undoubtedly influenced the sinister and fatal outcome of the trial.
<p/>I will only observe that from the first moments of the trial one peculiar characteristic of the case was conspicuous and observed by all, that is, the overwhelming strength of the prosecution as compared with the arguments the defense had to rely upon.
<p/>Every one realized it from the first moment that the facts began to group themselves round a single point, and the whole horrible and bloody crime was gradually revealed.
<p/>Every one, perhaps, felt from the first that the case was beyond dispute, that there was no doubt about it, that there could be really no discussion, and that the defense was only a matter of form, and that the prisoner was guilty, obviously and conclusively guilty.
<p/>I imagine that even the ladies, who were so impatiently longing for the acquittal of the interesting prisoner, were at the same time, without exception, convinced of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) guilt.
<p/>What's more, I believe they would have been mortified if his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) guilt had not been so firmly established, as that would have lessened the effect of the closing scene of the criminal's acquittal.
<p/>I repeat I don't intend to describe all the questions step by step. That he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) would be acquitted, all the ladies, strange to say, were firmly persuaded up to the very last moment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) is guilty, but he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) will be acquitted, from motives of humanity, in accordance with the new ideas, the new sentiments that had come into fashion,'' and so on, and so on.
<p/>'' And that was why they had crowded into the court so impatiently. The men were more interested in the contest between the prosecutor and the famous Fetyukovitch.
<p/>All were wondering and asking themselves what could even a talent like Fetyukovitch's make of such a desperate case; and so they followed his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) achievements, step by step, with concentrated attention.
<p/>Persons of experience suspected that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had some design, that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was working towards some object, but it was almost impossible to guess what it was.
<p/>But Fetyukovitch remained an enigma to all up to the very end, up to his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) speech. His (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) confidence and self-reliance were unmistakable, however.
<p/>Every one noticed with pleasure, moreover, that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>), after so short a stay, not more than three days, perhaps, among us, had so wonderfully succeeded in mastering the case and ``had studied it to a nicety.
<p/>People described with relish, afterwards, how cleverly he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``taken down''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>all the witnesses for the prosecution, and as far as possible perplexed them and, what's more, had aspersed their reputation and so depreciated the value of their evidence.
<p/>But it was supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) did this rather by way of sport, so to speak, for professional glory, to show nothing had been omitted of the accepted methods, for all were convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) could do no real good by such disparagement of the witnesses, and probably was more aware of this than any one, having some idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) own in the background,
<p/>'' some concealed weapon of defense, which he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) would suddenly reveal when the time came. But meanwhile, conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) strength, he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) seemed to be diverting himself.
<p/>So, for instance, when Grigory, Fyodor Pavlovitch's old servant, who had given the most damning piece of evidence about the open door, was examined, the counsel for the defense positively fastened upon him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) when his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) turn came to question him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>).
<p/>It must be noted that Grigory entered the hall with a composed and almost stately air, not the least disconcerted by the majesty of the court or the vast audience listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) gave evidence with as much confidence as though he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had been talking with his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) Marfa, only perhaps more respectfully. It was impossible to make him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) contradict himself.
<p/>The prosecutor questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) first in detail about the family life of the Karamazovs. The family picture stood out in lurid colors.
<p/>In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) profound reverence for the memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) deceased master, he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) yet bore witness that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had been unjust to Mitya and <div class="bookquote">``hadn't brought up his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) children as he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) should.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>)'d have been devoured by lice when he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was little, if it hadn't been for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) added, describing Mitya's early childhood.
<p/>It was plain to ear and eye that the witness was guileless and impartial. '' It wasn't fair either of the father to wrong his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son over his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mother's property, which was by right his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>In reply to the prosecutor's question what grounds he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had for asserting that Fyodor Pavlovitch had wronged his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) son in their money relations, Grigory, to the surprise of every one, had no proof at all to bring forward, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) still persisted that the arrangement with the son was <div class="bookquote">``unfair,''  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) ought ``to have paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) several thousand roubles more.
<p/>I must note, by the way, that the prosecutor asked this question whether Fyodor Pavlovitch had really kept back part of Mitya's inheritance with marked persistence of all the witnesses who could be asked it, not excepting Alyosha and Ivan, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) obtained no exact information from any one; all alleged that it was so, but were unable to bring forward any distinct proof.
<p/>Grigory's description of the scene at the dinner-table, when Dmitri had burst in and beaten his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) father, threatening to come back to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), made a sinister impression on the court, especially as the old servant's composure in telling it, his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) parsimony of words and peculiar phraseology, were as effective as eloquence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was not angry with Mitya for having knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) down and struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) on the face; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had forgiven him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) long ago, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said.
<p/>Of the deceased Smerdyakov he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) observed, crossing himself, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was a lad of ability, but stupid and afflicted, and, worse still, an infidel, and that it was Fyodor Pavlovitch and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) elder son who had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) to be so.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) defended Smerdyakov's honesty almost with warmth, and related how Smerdyakov had once found the master's money in the yard, and, instead of concealing it, had taken it to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) master, who had rewarded him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) with a <div class="bookquote">``gold piece''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>for it, and trusted him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) implicitly from that time forward.
<p/>'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) maintained obstinately that the door into the garden had been open. But he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was asked so many questions that I can't recall them all.
<p/>At last the counsel for the defense began to cross-examine him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>), and the first question he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) asked was about the envelope in which Fyodor Pavlovitch was supposed to have put three thousand roubles for <div class="bookquote">``a certain person.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fyodor Pavlovitch/Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov/Fyodor</b></font>)</div><p/>Grigory answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had not seen it and had never heard of the money from any one ``till everybody was talking about it.
<p/>This question about the envelope Fetyukovitch put to every one who could conceivably have known of it, as persistently as the prosecutor asked his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) question about Dmitri's inheritance, and got the same answer from all, that no one had seen the envelope, though many had heard of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you ever seen it, you, who were for so many years in close attendance on your master?''  (<font color='red'><b>Fetyukovitch</b></font>)</div>'' From the beginning every one noticed Fetyukovitch's persistence on this subject.
<p/>Of what was that balsam, or, rather, decoction, made, which, as we learn from the preliminary inquiry, you used on that evening to rub your lumbago, in the hope of curing it?
<p/>'' Now, with your permission I'll ask you a question,'' Fetyukovitch said, suddenly and unexpectedly. '' '' Grigory looked blankly at the questioner, and after a brief silence muttered, <div class="bookquote">``There was saffron in it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the questioner</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing but saffron? Don't you remember any other ingredient?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' There was milfoil in it, too.'' '' And pepper perhaps? ''
<p/>Fetyukovitch queried. '' Yes, there was pepper, too.'' <div class="bookquote">``Etcetera. And all dissolved in vodka? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' In spirit. '' There was a faint sound of laughter in the court.
<p/>After rubbing your back, I believe, you drank what was left in the bottle with a certain pious prayer, only known to your wife?''
<p/>'' You see, in spirit. <div class="bookquote">``I did. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did you drink much? Roughly speaking, a wine-glass or two?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It might have been a tumbler-full.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A tumbler-full, even. Perhaps a tumbler and a half?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grigory/Grigory Vassilyevitch</b></font>)</div>Grigory did not answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) seemed to see what was meant. ''
<p/>A glass and a half of neat spirit--is not at all bad, don't you think? You might see the gates of heaven open, not only the door into the garden?
<p/>'' Grigory remained silent. There was another laugh in the court. The President made a movement. '' Do you know for a fact,'' Fetyukovitch persisted, <div class="bookquote">``whether you were awake or not when you saw the open door?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Fetyukovitch</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was on my legs.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' That's not a proof that you were awake. '' -LRB-There was again laughter in the court.-RRB-
<p/>'' Could you have answered at that moment, if any one had asked you a question--for instance, what year it is?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And what year is it, Anno Domini, do you know? '' Grigory stood with a perplexed face, looking straight at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grigory</b></font>) tormentor.
<p/>Strange to say, it appeared he (<font color='blue'><b>Grigory</b></font>) really did not know what year it was. '' But perhaps you can tell me how many fingers you have on your hands?''
<p/>'' I am a servant,'' Grigory said suddenly, in a loud and distinct voice. '' If my betters think fit to make game of me, it is my duty to suffer it.
<p/>'' Fetyukovitch was a little taken aback, and the President intervened, reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) must ask more relevant questions. Fetyukovitch bowed with dignity and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had no more questions to ask of the witness.
<p/>The public and the jury, of course, were left with a grain of doubt in their minds as to the evidence of a man who might, while undergoing a certain cure, have seen <div class="bookquote">``the gates of heaven,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>and who did not even know what year he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was living in.
<p/>The President, turning to the prisoner, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had any comment to make on the evidence of the last witness.
<p/>But before Grigory left the box another episode occurred. '' Except about the door, all he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) has said is true,'' cried Mitya, in a loud voice.
<p/>'' For combing the lice off me, I thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>); for forgiving my blows, I thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). The old man has been honest all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life and as faithful to my father as seven hundred poodles.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Prisoner, be careful in your language,''  (<font color='red'><b>the President</b></font>)</div>the President admonished him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>). '' I am not a poodle,'' Grigory muttered. '' All right, it's I am a poodle myself,'' cried Mitya.
<p/>'' If it's an insult, I take it to myself and I beg his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) pardon. I was a beast and cruel to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>I was cruel to Ćsop too. '' <div class="bookquote">``What Ćsop? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the President</b></font>)</div>the President asked sternly again. '' Oh, Pierrot ... my father, Fyodor Pavlovitch.
<p/>'' The President again and again warned Mitya impressively and very sternly to be more careful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) language. '' You are injuring yourself in the opinion of your judges.
<p/>'' The counsel for the defense was equally clever in dealing with the evidence of Rakitin. I may remark that Rakitin was one of the leading witnesses and one to whom the prosecutor attached great significance.
<p/>It appeared that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) knew everything; his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) knowledge was amazing, he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had been everywhere, seen everything, talked to everybody, knew every detail of the biography of Fyodor Pavlovitch and all the Karamazovs.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) described minutely Mitya's exploits in the <div class="bookquote">``Metropolis,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) compromising doings and sayings, and told the story of Captain Snegiryov's <div class="bookquote">``wisp of tow.
<p/>Of the envelope, it is true, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had only heard from Mitya himself. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Snegiryov</b></font>)</div>But even Rakitin could say nothing positive about Mitya's inheritance, and confined himself to contemptuous generalities.
<p/>Who could tell which of them was to blame, and which was in debt to the other, with their crazy Karamazov way of muddling things so that no one could make head or tail of it?''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) attributed the tragic crime to the habits that had become ingrained by ages of serfdom and the distressed condition of Russia, due to the lack of appropriate institutions.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was, in fact, allowed some latitude of speech. This was the first occasion on which Rakitin showed what he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) could do, and attracted notice.
<p/>The prosecutor knew that the witness was preparing a magazine article on the case, and afterwards in his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) speech, as we shall see later, quoted some ideas from the article, showing that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had seen it already.
<p/>The picture drawn by the witness was a gloomy and sinister one, and greatly strengthened the case for the prosecution. Altogether, Rakitin's discourse fascinated the public by its independence and the extraordinary nobility of its ideas.
<p/>But Rakitin, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) youthful ardor, made a slight blunder, of which the counsel for the defense at once adroitly took advantage.
<p/>Answering certain questions about Grushenka, and carried away by the loftiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) own sentiments and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) success, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) was, of course, conscious, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) went so far as to speak somewhat contemptuously of Agrafena Alexandrovna as <div class="bookquote">``the kept mistress of Samsonov.
<p/>There were even two or three outbreaks of applause when he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) spoke of serfdom and the distressed condition of Russia. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Agrafena Alexandrovna/Agrafena</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) would have given a good deal to take back his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) words afterwards, for Fetyukovitch caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) out over it at once.
<p/>And it was all because Rakitin had not reckoned on the lawyer having been able to become so intimately acquainted with every detail in so short a time.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Allow me to ask,''  (<font color='red'><b>the counsel</b></font>)</div>began the counsel for the defense, with the most affable and even respectful smile, <div class="bookquote">``you are, of course, the same Mr. Rakitin whose pamphlet, The Life of the Deceased Elder, Father Zossima , published by the diocesan authorities, full of profound and religious reflections and preceded by an excellent and devout dedication to the bishop, I have just read with such pleasure?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the counsel</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not write it for publication ... it was published afterwards,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rakitin/Mr. Rakitin</b></font>)</div>muttered Rakitin, for some reason fearfully disconcerted and almost ashamed.
<p/>'' Oh, that's excellent! A thinker like you can, and indeed ought to, take the widest view of every social question.
<p/>Your most instructive pamphlet has been widely circulated through the patronage of the bishop, and has been of appreciable service.... But this is the chief thing I should like to learn from you.
<p/>You stated just now that you were very intimately acquainted with Madame Svyetlov. '' -LRB-It must be noted that Grushenka's surname was Svyetlov.
<p/>I heard it for the first time that day, during the case.-RRB- '' I cannot answer for all my acquaintances.... I am a young man ... and who can be responsible for every one he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meets?
<p/>'' cried Rakitin, flushing all over. '' I understand, I quite understand,'' cried Fetyukovitch, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>), too, were embarrassed and in haste to excuse himself.
<p/>You, like any other, might well be interested in an acquaintance with a young and beautiful woman who would readily entertain the élite of the youth of the neighborhood, but ...
<p/>It has come to my knowledge that Madame Svyetlov was particularly anxious a couple of months ago to make the acquaintance of the younger Karamazov, Alexey Fyodorovitch, and promised you twenty-five roubles, if you would bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) monastic dress.
<p/>And that actually took place on the evening of the day on which the terrible crime, which is the subject of the present investigation, was committed.
<p/>You brought Alexey Karamazov to Madame Svyetlov, and did you receive the twenty-five roubles from Madame Svyetlov as a reward, that's what I wanted to hear from you?''
<p/>'' I only wanted to know ... '' It was a joke.... I don't see of what interest that can be to you....
<p/>I took it for a joke ... meaning to give it back later...'' <div class="bookquote">``Then you did take-- But you have not given it back yet ... or have you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' That's of no consequence,'' muttered Rakitin, <div class="bookquote">``I refuse to answer such questions.... Of course I shall give it back. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Rakitin/Mr. Rakitin</b></font>)</div><p/>The President intervened, but Fetyukovitch declared he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had no more questions to ask of the witness. Mr. Rakitin left the witness-box not absolutely without a stain upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) character.
<p/>The effect left by the lofty idealism of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) speech was somewhat marred, and Fetyukovitch's expression, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) walk away, seemed to suggest to the public <div class="bookquote">``this is a specimen of the lofty-minded persons who accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>I remember that this incident, too, did not pass off without an outbreak from Mitya. Enraged by the tone in which Rakitin had referred to Grushenka, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) suddenly shouted <div class="bookquote">``Bernard!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>When, after Rakitin's cross- examination, the President asked the prisoner if he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had anything to say, Mitya cried loudly: <div class="bookquote">``Since I've been arrested, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) has borrowed money from me!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is a contemptible Bernard and opportunist, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) doesn't believe in God; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) took the bishop in!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Mitya, of course, was pulled up again for the intemperance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) language, but Rakitin was done for.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) appeared in ragged and dirty clothes, muddy boots, and in spite of the vigilance and expert observation of the police officers, he (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>) turned out to be hopelessly drunk.
<p/>Captain Snegiryov's evidence was a failure, too, but from quite a different reason. On being asked about Mitya's attack upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) refused to answer.
<p/>'' God bless him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). Ilusha told me not to. God will make it up to me yonder. '' '' Who told you not to tell?
<p/>Of whom are you talking?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ilusha, my little son. ' Father, father, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) insulted you!' He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said that at the stone.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is dying... ''  (<font color='red'><b>The captain</b></font>)</div>The captain suddenly began sobbing, and plumped down on his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) knees before the President. He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) was hurriedly led away amidst the laughter of the public.
<p/>Fetyukovitch went on making the most of every opportunity, and amazed people more and more by his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) minute knowledge of the case.
<p/>The effect prepared by the prosecutor did not come off at all. Thus, for example, Trifon Borissovitch made a great impression, of course, very prejudicial to Mitya.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) calculated almost on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) fingers that on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) first visit to Mokroe, Mitya must have spent three thousand roubles, <div class="bookquote">``or very little less.
<p/>And as for our lousy peasants, it wasn't a case of flinging half a rouble in the street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) made them presents of twenty-five roubles each, at least, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) didn't give them less.
<p/>Just think what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) squandered on those gypsy girls alone! And what a lot of money was simply stolen from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)!
<p/>And if any one did steal, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) did not leave a receipt. How could one catch the thief when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was flinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) money away all the time?
<p/>Our peasants are robbers, you know ; they have no care for their souls. And the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) went on with the girls, our village girls!
<p/>They're completely set up since then, I tell you, they used to be poor. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) recalled, in fact, every item of expense and added it all up.
<p/>So the theory that only fifteen hundred had been spent and the rest had been put aside in a little bag seemed inconceivable.
<p/>I saw three thousand as clear as a penny in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands, I saw it with my own eyes; I should think I ought to know how to reckon money,'' cried Trifon Borissovitch, doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) best to satisfy <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) betters.
<p/>When Fetyukovitch had to cross-examine him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) scarcely tried to refute his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) evidence, but began asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) about an incident at the first carousal at Mokroe, a month before the arrest, when Timofey and another peasant called Akim had picked up on the floor in the passage a hundred roubles dropped by Mitya when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was drunk, and had given them to Trifon Borissovitch and received a rouble each from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) for doing so.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Trifon Borissovitch/Trifon</b></font>)</div>'' '' Well,'' asked the lawyer, <div class="bookquote">``did you give that hundred roubles back to Mr. Karamazov? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>Trifon Borissovitch shuffled in vain....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) was obliged, after the peasants had been examined, to admit the finding of the hundred roubles, only adding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) had religiously returned it all to Dmitri Fyodorovitch <div class="bookquote">``in perfect honesty, and it's only because his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) honor was in liquor at the time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) wouldn't remember it.
<p/>But, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had denied the incident of the hundred roubles till the peasants had been called to prove it, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) evidence as to returning the money to Mitya was naturally regarded with great suspicion.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dmitri/Dmitri Fyodorovitch/Dmitri Karamazov</b></font>)</div>So one of the most dangerous witnesses brought forward by the prosecution was again discredited. The same thing happened with the Poles.
<p/>They took up an attitude of pride and independence; they vociferated loudly that they had both been in the service of the Crown, and that <div class="bookquote">``Pan Mitya''  (<font color='red'><b>Pan</b></font>)</div>had offered them three thousand <div class="bookquote">``to buy their honor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pan</b></font>)</div>and that they had seen a large sum of money in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Pan Mussyalovitch introduced a terrible number of Polish words into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sentences, and seeing that this only increased his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) consequence in the eyes of the President and the prosecutor, grew more and more pompous, and ended by talking in Polish altogether.
<p/>Trifon Borissovitch, recalled, was forced, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) evasions, to admit that Pan Vrublevsky had substituted another pack of cards for the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had provided, and that Pan Mussyalovitch had cheated during the game.
<p/>But Fetyukovitch caught them, too, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) snares. Kalganov confirmed this, and both the Poles left the witness-box with damaged reputations, amidst laughter from the public.
<p/>Then exactly the same thing happened with almost all the most dangerous witnesses. Fetyukovitch succeeded in casting a slur on all of them, and dismissing them with a certain derision.
<p/>The lawyers and experts were lost in admiration, and were only at a loss to understand what good purpose could be served by it, for all, I repeat, felt that the case for the prosecution could not be refuted, but was growing more and more tragically overwhelming.
<p/>But from the confidence of the <div class="bookquote">``great magician''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>they saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>magician</b></font>) was serene, and they waited, feeling that <div class="bookquote">``such a man''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>had not come from Petersburg for nothing, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not a man to return unsuccessful.
<p/>Chapter III. The Medical Experts And A Pound Of Nuts The evidence of the medical experts, too, was of little use to the prisoner.
<p/>The medical line of defense had only been taken up through the insistence of Katerina Ivanovna, who had sent for a celebrated doctor from Moscow on purpose.
<p/>And it appeared later that Fetyukovitch had not reckoned much upon it. The case for the defense could, of course, lose nothing by it and might, with luck, gain something from it.
<p/>There was, however, an element of comedy about it, through the difference of opinion of the doctors. The medical experts were the famous doctor from Moscow, our doctor, Herzenstube, and the young doctor, Varvinsky.
<p/>The two latter appeared also as witnesses for the prosecution. The first to be called in the capacity of expert was Doctor Herzenstube.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was a gray and bald old man of seventy, of middle height and sturdy build. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was much esteemed and respected by every one in the town.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was a conscientious doctor and an excellent and pious man, a Hernguter or Moravian brother, I am not quite sure which.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had been living amongst us for many years and behaved with wonderful dignity. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was a kind-hearted and humane man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) treated the sick poor and peasants for nothing, visited them in their slums and huts, and left money for medicine, but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was as obstinate as a mule.
<p/>Almost every one in the town was aware, by the way, that the famous doctor had, within the first two or three days of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) presence among us, uttered some extremely offensive allusions to Doctor Herzenstube's qualifications.
<p/>Though the Moscow doctor asked twenty-five roubles for a visit, several people in the town were glad to take advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) arrival, and rushed to consult him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) regardless of expense.
<p/>All these had, of course, been previously patients of Doctor Herzenstube, and the celebrated doctor had criticized his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) treatment with extreme harshness.
<p/>If once he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had taken an idea into his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head, there was no shaking it. Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had asked the patients as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) saw them, ``Well, who has been cramming you with nostrums?
<p/>Doctor Herzenstube, of course, heard all this, and now all the three doctors made their appearance, one after another, to be examined.
<p/>Then giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) grounds for this opinion, which I omit here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) added that the abnormality was not only evident in many of the prisoner's actions in the past, but was apparent even now at this very moment.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was asked to explain how it was apparent now at this moment, the old doctor, with simple-hearted directness, pointed out that the prisoner on entering the court had <div class="bookquote">``an extraordinary air, remarkable in the circumstances'' (<font color='red'><b>the prisoner</b></font>)</div>; that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``marched in like a soldier, looking straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), though it would have been more natural for him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to look to the left where, among the public, the ladies were sitting, seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was a great admirer of the fair sex and must be thinking much of what the ladies are saying of him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the old man concluded in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) peculiar language.
<p/>I must add that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke Russian readily, but every phrase was formed in German style, which did not, however, trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), for it had always been a weakness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke Russian perfectly, better indeed than Russians.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very fond of using Russian proverbs, always declaring that the Russian proverbs were the best and most expressive sayings in the whole world.
<p/>I may remark, too, that in conversation, through absent-mindedness he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) often forgot the most ordinary words, which sometimes went out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew them perfectly.
<p/>The same thing happened, though, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke German, and at such times he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always waved his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face as though trying to catch the lost word, and no one could induce him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to go on speaking till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had found the missing word.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remark that the prisoner ought to have looked at the ladies on entering roused a whisper of amusement in the audience.
<p/>All our ladies were very fond of our old doctor; they knew, too, that having been all his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) life a bachelor and a religious man of exemplary conduct, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) looked upon women as lofty creatures.
<p/>Herzenstube? He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)! '' Doctor Herzenstube roundly declared that the abnormality of the prisoner's mental faculties was self-evident. And so his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) unexpected observation struck every one as very queer.
<p/>The Moscow doctor, being questioned in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) turn, definitely and emphatically repeated that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) considered the prisoner's mental condition abnormal in the highest degree.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) talked at length and with erudition of <div class="bookquote">``aberration''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``mania,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and argued that, from all the facts collected, the prisoner had undoubtedly been in a condition of aberration for several days before his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) arrest, and, if the crime had been committed by him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), it must, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) were conscious of it, have been almost involuntary, as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had not the power to control the morbid impulse that possessed him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
<p/>But apart from temporary aberration, the doctor diagnosed mania, which premised, in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) words, to lead to complete insanity in the future.
<p/>-LRB-It must be noted that I report this in my own words, the doctor made use of very learned and professional language.-RRB-
<p/>Not to refer to what I have not seen, that is, the crime itself and the whole catastrophe, the day before yesterday, while he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was talking to me, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had an unaccountably fixed look in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) eye.
<p/>'' All his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) actions are in contravention of common sense and logic,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) continued. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) laughed unexpectedly when there was nothing to laugh at.
<p/>But the doctor detected mania, above all, in the fact that the prisoner could not even speak of the three thousand roubles, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) considered himself to have been cheated, without extraordinary irritation, though he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) could speak comparatively lightly of other misfortunes and grievances.
<p/>According to all accounts, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had even in the past, whenever the subject of the three thousand roubles was touched on, flown into a perfect frenzy, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was reported to be a disinterested and not grasping man.
<p/>As to the opinion of my learned colleague,'' the Moscow doctor added ironically in conclusion, <div class="bookquote">``that the prisoner would, on entering the court, have naturally looked at the ladies and not straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), I will only say that, apart from the playfulness of this theory, it is radically unsound.
<p/>For though I fully agree that the prisoner, on entering the court where his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) fate will be decided, would not naturally look straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) in that fixed way, and that that may really be a sign of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) abnormal mental condition, at the same time I maintain that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would naturally not look to the left at the ladies, but, on the contrary, to the right to find his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) legal adviser, on whose help all his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hopes rest and on whose defense all his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) future depends.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) showed continual and inexplicable irritability, using strange words, `Bernard!' `Ethics!' and others equally inappropriate. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Moscow doctor</b></font>)</div>'' '' The doctor expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) opinion positively and emphatically.
<p/>But the unexpected pronouncement of Doctor Varvinsky gave the last touch of comedy to the difference of opinion between the experts.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) opinion the prisoner was now, and had been all along, in a perfectly normal condition, and, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) certainly must have been in a nervous and exceedingly excited state before his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) arrest, this might have been due to several perfectly obvious causes, jealousy, anger, continual drunkenness, and so on.
<p/>As to the question whether the prisoner should have looked to the left or to the right on entering the court, <div class="bookquote">``in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) modest opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prisoner</b></font>)</div>the prisoner would naturally look straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) on entering the court, as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had in fact done, as that was where the judges, on whom his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) fate depended, were sitting.
<p/>So that it was just by looking straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) showed his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) perfectly normal state of mind at the present.
<p/>But this nervous condition would not involve the mental aberration of which mention had just been made. The young doctor concluded his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``modest''  (<font color='red'><b>The doctor</b></font>)</div>testimony with some heat.
<p/>Mitya, of course, was checked, but the young doctor's opinion had a decisive influence on the judges and on the public, and, as appeared afterwards, every one agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).
<p/>'' Bravo, doctor!'' cried Mitya, from his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) seat, <div class="bookquote">``just so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>But Doctor Herzenstube, when called as a witness, was quite unexpectedly of use to Mitya.
<p/>As an old resident in the town who had known the Karamazov family for years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) furnished some facts of great value for the prosecution, and suddenly, as though recalling something, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``But the poor young man might have had a very different life, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a good heart both in childhood and after childhood, that I know.
<p/>But the Russian proverb says, `If a man has one head, it's good, but if another clever man comes to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), it would be better still, for then there will be two heads and not only one.' ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew the old man's habit of talking slowly and deliberately, regardless of the impression he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was making and of the delay he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was causing, and highly prizing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flat, dull and always gleefully complacent German wit.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One head is good, but two are better,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div>the prosecutor put in impatiently. The old man was fond of making jokes.
<p/>One head is good, but two are much better, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not meet another head with wits, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wits went.
<p/>'' Oh, yes, that's what I say,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on stubbornly. '' Where did they go? I've forgotten the word. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on, passing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, yes, spazieren .''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wandering?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, yes, wandering, that's what I say.
<p/>Well, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wits went wandering and fell in such a deep hole that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lost himself. And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a grateful and sensitive boy.
<p/>Oh, I remember him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very well, a little chap so high, left neglected by his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) father in the back yard, when he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) ran about without boots on his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) feet, and his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) little breeches hanging by one button.
<p/>'' A note of feeling and tenderness suddenly came into the honest old man's voice. Fetyukovitch positively started, as though scenting something, and caught at it instantly.
<p/>'' Oh, yes, I was a young man then.... I was ... well, I was forty-five then, and had only just come here.
<p/>And I was so sorry for the boy then; I asked myself why shouldn't I buy him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a pound of ... a pound of what?
<p/>I've forgotten what it's called. A pound of what children are very fond of, what is it, what is it? ''
<p/>The doctor began waving his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hands again. '' It grows on a tree and is gathered and given to every one...
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Apples?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, no, no. You have a dozen of apples, not a pound.... No, there are a lot of them, and all little.
<p/>You put them in the mouth and crack.'' <div class="bookquote">``Nuts?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Quite so, nuts, I say so. '' The doctor repeated in the calmest way as though he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had been at no loss for a word.
<p/>And I bought him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) a pound of nuts, for no one had ever bought the boy a pound of nuts before.
<p/>'' And I lifted my finger and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), `Boy, Gott der Vater .' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gott</b></font>) laughed and said, ' Gott der Vater .'... ' Gott der Sohn .'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sohn</b></font>) laughed again and lisped, ' Gott der Sohn .' ' Gott der heilige Geist .' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gott</b></font>) laughed and said as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Gott</b></font>) could, ' Gott der heilige Geist .'
<p/>I went away, and two days after I happened to be passing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gott</b></font>) shouted to me of himself, `Uncle, Gott der Vater, Gott der Sohn ,' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sohn</b></font>) had only forgotten ' Gott der heilige Geist .'
<p/>But I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Gott</b></font>) of it and I felt very sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gott</b></font>) again. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gott</b></font>) was taken away, and I did not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gott</b></font>) again.
<p/>I am sitting one morning in my study, a white-haired old man, when there walks into the room a blooming young man, whom I should never have recognized, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger and said, laughing, ' Gott der Vater, Gott der Sohn , and Gott der heilige Geist .
<p/>I have just arrived and have come to thank you for that pound of nuts, for no one else ever bought me a pound of nuts; you are the only one that ever did.'
<p/>And then I remembered my happy youth and the poor child in the yard, without boots on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gott</b></font>) feet, and my heart was touched and I said, `You are a grateful young man, for you have remembered all your life the pound of nuts I bought you in your childhood.'
<p/>Twenty- three years passed. And I embraced him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and blessed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And I shed tears. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laughed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shed tears, too ... for the Russian often laughs when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to be weeping.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did weep; I saw it. And now, alas!...'' '' And I am weeping now, German, I am weeping now, too, you saintly man,'' Mitya cried suddenly.
<p/>In any case the anecdote made a certain favorable impression on the public. But the chief sensation in Mitya's favor was created by the evidence of Katerina Ivanovna, which I will describe directly.
<p/>Indeed, when the witnesses ŕ décharge , that is, called by the defense, began giving evidence, fortune seemed all at once markedly more favorable to Mitya, and what was particularly striking, this was a surprise even to the counsel for the defense.
<p/>But before Katerina Ivanovna was called, Alyosha was examined, and he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) recalled a fact which seemed to furnish positive evidence against one important point made by the prosecution.
<p/>Chapter IV. Fortune Smiles On Mitya It came quite as a surprise even to Alyosha himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was not required to take the oath, and I remember that both sides addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) very gently and sympathetically.
<p/>It was evident that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) reputation for goodness had preceded him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). Alyosha gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) evidence modestly and with restraint, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) warm sympathy for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) unhappy brother was unmistakable.
<p/>In answer to one question, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sketched his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) brother's character as that of a man, violent-tempered perhaps and carried away by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) passions, but at the same time honorable, proud and generous, capable of self-sacrifice, if necessary.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) admitted, however, that, through his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) passion for Grushenka and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) rivalry with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) brother had been of late in an intolerable position.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) repelled with indignation the suggestion that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) brother might have committed a murder for the sake of gain, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) recognized that the three thousand roubles had become almost an obsession with Mitya; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) looked upon them as part of the inheritance he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had been cheated of by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father, and that, indifferent as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was to money as a rule, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) could not even speak of that three thousand without fury.
<p/>As for the rivalry of the two <div class="bookquote">``ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div>as the prosecutor expressed it--that is, of Grushenka and Katya--he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) answered evasively and was even unwilling to answer one or two questions altogether.
<p/>'' Did your brother tell you, anyway, that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) intended to kill your father?'' asked the prosecutor. '' You can refuse to answer if you think necessary,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) added.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) spoke to me once of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hatred for our father and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) fear that at an extreme moment ... at a moment of fury, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might perhaps murder him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did not tell me so directly,'' answered Alyosha. '' How so? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) indirectly?'' '' '' And you believed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)?''
<p/>But I never doubted that some higher feeling would always save him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) at the fatal moment, as it has indeed saved him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), for it was not he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) killed my father,'' Alyosha said firmly, in a loud voice that was heard throughout the court.
<p/>``Let me assure you that I fully believe in the complete sincerity of your conviction and do not explain it by or identify it with your affection for your unhappy brother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid to say that I did. The prosecutor started like a war-horse at the sound of a trumpet. Your peculiar view of the whole tragic episode is known to us already from the preliminary investigation.
<p/>I won't attempt to conceal from you that it is highly individual and contradicts all the other evidence collected by the prosecution.
<p/>And so I think it essential to press you to tell me what facts have led you to this conviction of your brother's innocence and of the guilt of another person against whom you gave evidence at the preliminary inquiry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I only answered the questions asked me at the preliminary inquiry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>replied Alyosha, slowly and calmly. '' I made no accusation against Smerdyakov of myself.''
<p/>'' Yet you gave evidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``I was led to do so by my brother Dmitri's words. I was told what took place at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) arrest and how he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had pointed to Smerdyakov before I was examined.
<p/>I believe absolutely that my brother is innocent, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) didn't commit the murder, then--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then Smerdyakov? Why Smerdyakov? And why are you so completely persuaded of your brother's innocence?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot help believing my brother. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wouldn't lie to me. I saw from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) face he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wasn't lying.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) face? Is that all the proof you have?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have no other proof. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>'' And of Smerdyakov's guilt you have no proof
<p/>whatever but your brother's word and the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) face?'' '' No, I have no other proof. '' The prosecutor dropped the examination at this point.
<p/>There had been talk about Smerdyakov before the trial; some one had heard something, some one had pointed out something else, it was said that Alyosha had gathered together some extraordinary proofs of his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) brother's innocence and Smerdyakov's guilt, and after all there was nothing, no evidence except certain moral convictions so natural in a brother.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) asking Alyosha when it was that the prisoner had told him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hatred for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) father and that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might kill him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had heard it, for instance, at their last meeting before the catastrophe, Alyosha started as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) answered, as though only just recollecting and understanding something.
<p/>The impression left by Alyosha's evidence on the public was most disappointing. But Fetyukovitch began his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cross-examination. '' I remember one circumstance now which I'd quite forgotten myself.
<p/>'' And, obviously only now for the first time struck by an idea, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) recounted eagerly how, at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) last interview with Mitya that evening under the tree, on the road to the monastery, Mitya had struck himself on the breast, <div class="bookquote">``the upper part of the breast,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>and had repeated several times that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had a means of regaining his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) honor, that that means was here, here on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) breast.
<p/>I thought, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) struck himself on the breast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) meant that it was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heart,'' Alyosha continued, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) might find in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) heart strength to save himself from some awful disgrace which was awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) did not dare confess even to me.
<p/>I must confess I did think at the time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was speaking of our father, and that the disgrace he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was shuddering at was the thought of going to our father and doing some violence to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>Yet it was just then that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pointed to something on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) breast, so that I remember the idea struck me at the time that the heart is not on that part of the breast, but below, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) struck himself much too high, just below the neck, and kept pointing to that place.
<p/>My idea seemed silly to me at the time, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was perhaps pointing then to that little bag in which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had fifteen hundred roubles!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div><p/>It wasn't clear to me at the time, but now-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Just so,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Mitya cried from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) place. '' That's right, Alyosha, it was the little bag I struck with my fist.
<p/>'' Fetyukovitch flew to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) in hot haste entreating him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to keep quiet, and at the same instant pounced on Alyosha.
<p/>Alyosha, carried away himself by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) recollection, warmly expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) theory that this disgrace was probably just that fifteen hundred roubles on him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) might have returned to Katerina Ivanovna as half of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) owed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), but which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had yet determined not to repay her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) and to use for another purpose--namely, to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to elope with Grushenka, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) consented.
<p/>My brother cried several times that half of the disgrace, half of it -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said half several times-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could free himself from at once, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was so unhappy in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) weakness of will that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wouldn't do it ... that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knew beforehand he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was incapable of doing it!''
<p/>'' It is so , it must be so,'' exclaimed Alyosha, in sudden excitement. '' '' And you clearly, confidently remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) struck himself just on this part of the breast?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Clearly and confidently, for I thought at the time, `Why does he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) strike himself up there when the heart is lower down?'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Fetyukovitch</b></font>)</div>Fetyukovitch asked eagerly. and the thought seemed stupid to me at the time ... I remember its seeming stupid ... it flashed through my mind.
<p/>It was that little bag he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) meant when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had the means but wouldn't give back that fifteen hundred.
<p/>That's what brought it back to me just now. How could I have forgotten it till now? And when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was arrested at Mokroe he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cried out--
<p/>I know, I was told it--that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) considered it the most disgraceful act of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) life that when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had the means of repaying Katerina Ivanovna half -LRB-half, note!-RRB-
<p/>what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) owed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) yet could not bring himself to repay the money and preferred to remain a thief in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eyes rather than part with it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) asked Alyosha to describe once more how it had all happened, and several times insisted on the question, <div class="bookquote">``Had the prisoner seemed to point to anything?
<p/>And what torture, what torture that debt has been to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha exclaimed in conclusion. The prosecutor, of course, intervened. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had simply struck himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) fist on the breast?''
<p/>'' But it was not with his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) fist,'' cried Alyosha; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) pointed with his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) fingers and pointed here, very high up....
<p/>How could I have so completely forgotten it till this moment? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>The President asked Mitya what he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had to say to the last witness's evidence.
<p/>Mitya confirmed it, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had been pointing to the fifteen hundred roubles which were on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) breast, just below the neck, and that that was, of course, the disgrace, <div class="bookquote">``A disgrace I cannot deny, the most shameful act of my whole life,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried Mitya.
<p/>'' I might have repaid it and didn't repay it. I preferred to remain a thief in her (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) eyes rather than give it back.
<p/>And the most shameful part of it was that I knew beforehand I shouldn't give it back! You are right, Alyosha!
<p/>What was important and striking about it was that one fact at least had been found, and even though this were only one tiny bit of evidence, a mere hint at evidence, it did go some little way towards proving that the bag had existed and had contained fifteen hundred roubles and that the prisoner had not been lying at the preliminary inquiry when he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) alleged at Mokroe that those fifteen hundred roubles were <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own.
<p/>Thanks, Alyosha! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So Alyosha's cross-examination ended. '' Alyosha was glad. With a flushed face he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) moved away to the seat assigned to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) kept repeating to himself: <div class="bookquote">``How was it I forgot? How could I have forgotten it? And what made it come back to me now?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Katerina Ivanovna was called to the witness-box. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) entered something extraordinary happened in the court. The ladies clutched their lorgnettes and opera-glasses.
<p/>There was a stir among the men: some stood up to get a better view. Everybody alleged afterwards that Mitya had turned <div class="bookquote">``white as a sheet''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) entrance.
<p/>It was impossible to tell from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) face that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was agitated; but there was a resolute gleam in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) dark and gloomy eyes.
<p/>All in black, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) advanced modestly, almost timidly. I may remark that many people mentioned that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) looked particularly handsome at that moment.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) spoke softly but clearly, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was heard all over the court. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) expressed herself with composure, or at least tried to appear composed.
<p/>The President began his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) examination discreetly and very respectfully, as though afraid to touch on <div class="bookquote">``certain chords,''  (<font color='red'><b>The President</b></font>)</div>and showing consideration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) great unhappiness.
<p/>But in answer to one of the first questions Katerina Ivanovna replied firmly that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had been formerly betrothed to the prisoner, <div class="bookquote">``until he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) left me of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own accord...''  (<font color='red'><b>the prisoner</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) added quietly.
<p/>When they asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) about the three thousand she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had entrusted to Mitya to post to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) relations, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said firmly, <div class="bookquote">``I didn't give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) the money simply to send it off.
<p/>I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) the three thousand on the understanding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) should post it within the month if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cared to.
<p/>I felt at the time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was in great need of money.... There was no need for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) to worry himself about that debt afterwards.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I will not repeat all the questions asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) answers in detail. I will only give the substance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) evidence.
<p/>I was firmly convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would send off that sum as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) got money from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) went on.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) felt quite certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would receive the money from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father, and spoke to me several times about it.
<p/>I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had a feud with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father and have always believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had been unfairly treated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father.
<p/>'' '' I have never doubted his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) disinterestedness and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) honesty ... his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) scrupulous honesty ... in money matters. I don't remember any threat uttered by him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) against his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had come to me at that time, I should have at once relieved his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) anxiety about that unlucky three thousand roubles, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had given up coming to see me ... and I myself was put in such a position ... that I could not invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)....
<p/>And I had no right, indeed, to be exacting as to that money,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) added suddenly, and there was a ring of resolution in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) voice.
<p/>I was once indebted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) for assistance in money for more than three thousand, and I took it, although I could not at that time foresee that I should ever be in a position to repay my debt.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) certainly never uttered any such threat before me. '' '' There was a note of defiance in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) voice. It was then
<p/>Fetyukovitch began his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cross-examination. '' Did that take place not here, but at the beginning of your acquaintance?'' Fetyukovitch suggested cautiously, feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) way, instantly scenting something favorable.
<p/>I must mention in parenthesis that, though Fetyukovitch had been brought from Petersburg partly at the instance of Katerina Ivanovna herself, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) knew nothing about the episode of the four thousand roubles given her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) by Mitya, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``bowing to the ground to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>It may be pretty certainly assumed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) herself did not know till the very last minute whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would speak of that episode in the court, and waited for the inspiration of the moment.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) concealed this from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) and said nothing about it, and that was strange. No, I can never forget those moments.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) began telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) story. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) told everything, the whole episode that Mitya had told Alyosha, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) bowing to the ground, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) reason.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) told about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) father and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) going to Mitya, and did not in one word, in a single hint, suggest that Mitya had himself, through her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sister, proposed they should <div class="bookquote">``send him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) Katerina Ivanovna''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>to fetch the money.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) generously concealed that and was not ashamed to make it appear as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) own impulse run to the young officer, relying on something ... to beg him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) for the money.
<p/>It was something tremendous! I turned cold and trembled as I listened. The court was hushed, trying to catch each word.
<p/>Even from such a self-willed and contemptuously proud girl as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was, such an extremely frank avowal, such sacrifice, such self-immolation, seemed incredible.
<p/>To save the man who had deceived and insulted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and to help, in however small a degree, in saving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), by creating a strong impression in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) favor.
<p/>And, indeed, the figure of the young officer who, with a respectful bow to the innocent girl, handed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) last four thousand roubles--all he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had in the world--was thrown into a very sympathetic and attractive light, but ...
<p/>It was something unexampled. And for what, for whom? I had a painful misgiving at heart! I felt that calumny might come of it later -LRB-and it did, in fact, it did-RRB-.
<p/>It was repeated all over the town afterwards with spiteful laughter that the story was perhaps not quite complete--that is, in the statement that the officer had let the young lady depart <div class="bookquote">``with nothing but a respectful bow.
<p/>And even if nothing had been omitted, if this were the whole story,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>the most highly respected of our ladies maintained, <div class="bookquote">``even then it's very doubtful whether it was creditable for a young girl to behave in that way, even for the sake of saving her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>ladies</b></font>)</div>It was hinted that something was here omitted. '' '' And can Katerina Ivanovna, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) intelligence, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) morbid sensitiveness, have failed to understand that people would talk like that?
<p/>Of course, all these nasty little suspicions as to the truth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) story only arose afterwards and at the first moment all were deeply impressed by it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) must have understood it, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) mind to tell everything. As for the judges and the lawyers, they listened in reverent, almost shame-faced silence to Katerina Ivanovna.
<p/>The prosecutor did not venture upon even one question on the subject. Fetyukovitch made a low bow to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>). Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was almost triumphant!
<p/>For a man to give his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) last four thousand on a generous impulse and then for the same man to murder his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father for the sake of robbing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of three thousand--the idea seemed too incongruous.
<p/>Much ground had been gained. Fetyukovitch felt that now the charge of theft, at least, was as good as disproved. ''
<p/>As for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).... I was told that once or twice, while Katerina Ivanovna was giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) evidence, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jumped up from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seat, sank back again, and hid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands.
<p/>But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had finished, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suddenly cried in a sobbing voice: <div class="bookquote">``Katya, why have you ruined me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sobs were audible all over the court.
<p/>The case'' was thrown into quite a different light. There was a wave of sympathy for Mitya. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) instantly restrained himself, and cried again: <div class="bookquote">``Now I am condemned!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sat rigid in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) place, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) teeth clenched and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) arms across his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) chest. Katerina Ivanovna remained in the court and sat down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) place.
<p/>Those who were sitting near her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) declared that for a long time she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) shivered all over as though in a fever.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was pale and sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eyes cast down. Grushenka was called. I am approaching the sudden catastrophe which was perhaps the final cause of Mitya's ruin.
<p/>For I am convinced, so is every one--all the lawyers said the same afterwards--that if the episode had not occurred, the prisoner would at least have been recommended to mercy.
<p/>But of that later. A few words first about Grushenka. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), too, was dressed entirely in black, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) magnificent black shawl on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) shoulders.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) walked to the witness-box with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) smooth, noiseless tread, with the slightly swaying gait common in women of full figure.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) looked steadily at the President, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eyes neither to the right nor to the left. To my thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) looked very handsome at that moment, and not at all pale, as the ladies alleged afterwards.
<p/>They declared, too, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had a concentrated and spiteful expression. I believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was simply irritated and painfully conscious of the contemptuous and inquisitive eyes of our scandal-loving public.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was proud and could not stand contempt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was one of those people who flare up, angry and eager to retaliate, at the mere suggestion of contempt.
<p/>There was an element of timidity, too, of course, and inward shame at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) own timidity, so it was not strange that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) tone kept changing.
<p/>Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) spoke as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) were taking a desperate plunge; as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) felt, <div class="bookquote">``I don't care what happens, I'll say it....
<p/>At one moment it was angry, contemptuous and rough, and at another there was a sincere note of self- condemnation. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Apropos of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) acquaintance with Fyodor Pavlovitch, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) remarked curtly, <div class="bookquote">``That's all nonsense, and was it my fault that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) would pester me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But a minute later she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``It was all my fault. I was laughing at them both--at the old man and at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), too--and I brought both of them to this.
<p/>It was all on account of me it happened. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Samsonov's name came up somehow. '' That's nobody's business,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) snapped at once, with a sort of insolent defiance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) was my benefactor; he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) took me when I hadn't a shoe to my foot, when my family had turned me out.
<p/>'' '' The President reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), though very politely, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) must answer the questions directly, without going off into irrelevant details.
<p/>The envelope with the notes in it she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had not seen, but had only heard from <div class="bookquote">``that wicked wretch''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>that Fyodor Pavlovitch had an envelope with notes for three thousand in it.
<p/>Grushenka crimsoned and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) eyes flashed. '' But that was all foolishness. I was only laughing. I wouldn't have gone to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) for anything.''
<p/>'' To whom are you referring as `that wicked wretch'? '' inquired the prosecutor. '' The lackey, Smerdyakov, who murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>lackey</b></font>) master and hanged himself last night.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was, of course, at once asked what ground she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had for such a definite accusation; but it appeared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), too, had no grounds for it.
<p/>The woman who came between us has ruined him (<font color='blue'><b>lackey</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) is the cause of it all, let me tell you,'' Grushenka added.
<p/>'' '' Dmitri Fyodorovitch told me so himself; you can believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) seemed to be quivering with hatred, and there was a vindictive note in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) voice.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was again asked to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was referring. '' The young lady, Katerina Ivanovna there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sent for me, offered me chocolate, tried to fascinate me.
<p/>There's not much true shame about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), I can tell you that... '' At this point the President checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sternly, begging her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) to moderate her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) language.
<p/>When the prisoner was arrested at Mokroe,'' the prosecutor asked, <div class="bookquote">``every one saw and heard you run out of the next room and cry out: `It's all my fault.
<p/>But the jealous woman's heart was burning, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not care what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div>We'll go to Siberia together!'
<p/>So you already believed him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) to have murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) father?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't remember what I felt at the time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>answered Grushenka.
<p/>Every one was crying out that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had killed his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) father, and I felt that it was my fault, that it was on my account he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>).
<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) wasn't guilty, I believed him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) at once, and I believe him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) now and always shall believe him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>).
<p/>I remember that among other things he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) asked about Rakitin and the twenty-five roubles <div class="bookquote">``you paid him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) for bringing Alexey Fyodorovitch Karamazov to see you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Rakitin/Mr. Rakitin</b></font>)</div><p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) is not the man to tell a lie. '' Fetyukovitch began his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) cross-examination. '' There was nothing strange about his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) taking the money,'' sneered Grushenka, with angry contempt.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) was always coming to me for money: he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) used to get thirty roubles a month at least out of me, chiefly for luxuries: he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) had enough to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) without my help.
<p/>'' '' '' What led you to be so liberal to Mr. Rakitin? '' Fetyukovitch asked, in spite of an uneasy movement on the part of the President.
<p/>'' Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) is my cousin. His (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) mother was my mother's sister. But he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>)'s always besought me not to tell any one here of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) is so dreadfully ashamed of me.
<p/>This fact was a complete surprise to every one; no one in the town nor in the monastery, not even Mitya, knew of it.
<p/>Grushenka had somehow heard before she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) came into the court that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had given evidence against Mitya, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was angry.
<p/>The whole effect on the public, of Rakitin's speech, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) noble sentiments, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) attacks upon serfdom and the political disorder of Russia, was this time finally ruined.
<p/>'' I was told that Rakitin turned purple with shame where he (<font color='blue'><b>Rakitin</b></font>) sat. Fetyukovitch was satisfied: it was another godsend. Grushenka's cross-examination did not last long and, of course, there could be nothing particularly new in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) evidence.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) left a very disagreeable impression on the public; hundreds of contemptuous eyes were fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) finished giving her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) evidence and sat down again in the court, at a good distance from Katerina Ivanovna.
<p/>Mitya was silent throughout her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) evidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sat as though turned to stone, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) eyes fixed on the ground. Ivan was called to give evidence.
<p/>But the usher of the court announced to the President that, owing to an attack of illness or some sort of fit, the witness could not appear at the moment, but was ready to give his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) evidence as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) recovered.
<p/>Chapter V. A Sudden Catastrophe I may note that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had been called before Alyosha. But no one seemed to have heard it and it only came out later.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) entrance was for the first moment almost unnoticed. The principal witnesses, especially the two rival ladies, had already been questioned.
<p/>Several more witnesses were still to be heard, who probably had little information to give after all that had been given.
<p/>Ivan walked up with extraordinary slowness, looking at no one, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) head bowed, as though plunged in gloomy thought.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was irreproachably dressed, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face made a painful impression, on me at least: there was an earthy look in it, a look like a dying man's.
<p/>Curiosity was satisfied for the time; the public was feeling almost fatigued. Time was passing. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes were lusterless; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) raised them and looked slowly round the court.
<p/>The President began by informing him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) was a witness not on oath, that he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) might answer or refuse to answer, but that, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) must bear witness according to his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) conscience, and so on, and so on.
<p/>Ivan listened and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) blankly, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) face gradually relaxed into a smile, and as soon as the President, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) in astonishment, finished, he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) laughed outright.
<p/>Alyosha jumped up from his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) seat and moaned <div class="bookquote">``Ah! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>I remember that, but it was hardly noticed. '' Well, and what else?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) asked in a loud voice. There was a hush in the court; there was a feeling of something strange.
<p/>The President showed signs of uneasiness. '' You ... are perhaps still unwell?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) began, looking everywhere for the usher. ''
<p/>Don't trouble yourself, your excellency, I am well enough and can tell you something interesting,'' Ivan answered with sudden calmness and respectfulness.
<p/>'' You have some special communication to make? '' the President went on, still mistrustfully. Ivan looked down, waited a few seconds and, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) head, answered, almost stammering: <div class="bookquote">``No ...
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) answered, as it were, reluctantly, with extreme brevity, with a sort of disgust which grew more and more marked, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) answered rationally.
<p/>I haven't. I have nothing particular. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>They began asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) questions. To many questions he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) did not know.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) knew nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father's money relations with Dmitri. '' I wasn't interested in the subject,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) added. Threats to murder his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had heard from the prisoner.
<p/>Of the money in the envelope he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had heard from Smerdyakov. '' The same thing over and over again,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) interrupted suddenly, with a look of weariness.
<p/>'' I have nothing particular to tell the court. '' <div class="bookquote">``I see you are unwell and understand your feelings,''  (<font color='red'><b>the President</b></font>)</div>the President began.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) turned to the prosecutor and the counsel for the defense to invite them to examine the witness, if necessary, when Ivan suddenly asked in an exhausted voice:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me go, your excellency, I feel very ill. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>And with these words, without waiting for permission, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) turned to walk out of the court.
<p/>But after taking four steps he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) stood still, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had reached a decision, smiled slowly, and went back. ''
<p/>I am like the peasant girl, your excellency ... you know. How does it go? ' I'll stand up if I like, and I won't if I don't.'
<p/>They were trying to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sarafan to take her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to church to be married, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, `I'll stand up if I like, and I won't if I don't.'...
<p/>It's in some book about the peasantry.'' '' What do you mean by that? '' the President asked severely. '' Why, this,'' Ivan suddenly pulled out a roll of notes.
<p/>'' -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) nodded towards the table on which lay the material evidence-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``for the sake of which our father was murdered.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here's the money ... the notes that lay in that envelope Where shall I put them? Mr. Superintendent, take them.
<p/>'' The usher of the court took the whole roll and handed it to the President. '' How could this money have come into your possession if it is the same money?
<p/>'' the President asked wonderingly. '' I got them from Smerdyakov, from the murderer, yesterday.... I was with him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) just before he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) hanged himself.
<p/>It was he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>), not my brother, killed our father. He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) and I incited him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) to do it ... Who doesn't desire his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) father's death?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you in your right mind? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the President</b></font>)</div>broke involuntarily from the President. '' I should think I am in my right mind ...
<p/>in the same nasty mind as all of you ... as all these ... ugly faces. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) turned suddenly to the audience.
<p/>'' My father has been murdered and they pretend they are horrified,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) snarled, with furious contempt. '' They keep up the sham with one another.
<p/>Liars! They all desire the death of their fathers. One reptile devours another.... If there hadn't been a murder, they'd have been angry and gone home ill-humored.
<p/>It's a spectacle they want! Panem et circenses . Though I am one to talk! Have you any water? Give me a drink for Christ's sake!
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) suddenly clutched his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) head. The usher at once approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>). Alyosha jumped up and cried, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) is ill. Don't believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) has brain fever.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Katerina Ivanovna rose impulsively from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) seat and, rigid with horror, gazed at Ivan. Mitya stood up and greedily looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) brother and listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) with a wild, strange smile.
<p/>'' Don't disturb yourselves. I am not mad, I am only a murderer,'' Ivan began again. '' You can't expect eloquence from a murderer,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) added suddenly for some reason and laughed a queer laugh.
<p/>The prosecutor bent over to the President in obvious dismay. The two other judges communicated in agitated whispers. Fetyukovitch pricked up his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) ears as he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) listened: the hall was hushed in expectation.
<p/>The President seemed suddenly to recollect himself. '' Witness, your words are incomprehensible and impossible here. Calm yourself, if you can, and tell your story ... if you really have something to tell.
<p/>How can you confirm your statement ... if indeed you are not delirious?'' '' That's just it. I have no proof.
<p/>That cur Smerdyakov won't send you proofs from the other world ... in an envelope. You think of nothing but envelopes--one is enough.
<p/>I've no witnesses ... except one, perhaps,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) smiled thoughtfully. '' Who is your witness?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) has a tail, your excellency, and that would be irregular!
<p/>Le diable n'existe point! Don't pay attention: he (<font color='blue'><b>Le</b></font>) is a paltry, pitiful devil,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) added suddenly. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) ceased laughing and spoke as it were, confidentially.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) is here somewhere, no doubt--under that table with the material evidence on it, perhaps. Where should he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) sit if not there?
<p/>You see, listen to me. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) I don't want to keep quiet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) talked about the geological cataclysm ... idiocy!
<p/>It's like a drunken man in the street bawling how `Vanka went to Petersburg,' and I would give a quadrillion quadrillions for two seconds of joy.
<p/>Come, release the monster ... he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s been singing a hymn. That's because his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart is light! You don't know me! Oh, how stupid all this business is!
<p/>Come, take me instead of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! I didn't come for nothing.... Why, why is everything so stupid?... '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began slowly, and as it were reflectively, looking round him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again.
<p/>But the court was all excitement by now. Alyosha rushed towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but the court usher had already seized Ivan by the arm.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) cried, staring into the man's face, and suddenly seizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) by the shoulders, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) flung him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) violently to the floor.
<p/>'' What are you about? '' But the police were on the spot and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was seized. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) screamed furiously. And all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was being removed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) yelled and screamed something incoherent.
<p/>The whole court was thrown into confusion. I don't remember everything as it happened. I was excited myself and could not follow.
<p/>I only know that afterwards, when everything was quiet again and every one understood what had happened, the court usher came in for a reprimand, though he (<font color='blue'><b>usher</b></font>) very reasonably explained that the witness had been quite well, that the doctor had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) an hour ago, when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had a slight attack of giddiness, but that, until he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had come into the court, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had talked quite consecutively, so that nothing could have been foreseen--that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had, in fact, insisted on giving evidence.
<p/>But before every one had completely regained their composure and recovered from this scene, it was followed by another. Katerina Ivanovna had an attack of hysterics.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sobbed, shrieking loudly, but refused to leave the court, struggled, and besought them not to remove her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>). Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) cried to the President:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is more evidence I must give at once ... at once! Here is a document, a letter ... take it, read it quickly, quickly!
<p/>It's a letter from that monster ... that man there, there!''  (<font color='red'><b>the President</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) pointed to Mitya. '' It was he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) killed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father, you will see that directly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wrote to me how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would kill his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) father! But the other one is ill, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is ill, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is delirious!
<p/>The court usher took the document she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) held out to the President, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>), dropping into her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) chair, hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) hands, began convulsively and noiselessly sobbing, shaking all over, and stifling every sound for fear she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) should be ejected from the court.
<p/>The document she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had handed up was that letter Mitya had written at the <div class="bookquote">``Metropolis''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>tavern, which Ivan had spoken of as a <div class="bookquote">``mathematical proof.
<p/>its mathematical conclusiveness was recognized, and had it not been for that letter, Mitya might have escaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) doom or, at least, that doom would have been less terrible.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) kept crying out, beside herself. '' Alas! It was, I repeat, difficult to notice every detail. What followed is still confused to my mind.
<p/>The President must, I suppose, have at once passed on the document to the judges, the jury, and the lawyers on both sides.
<p/>On being gently asked by the President whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had recovered sufficiently, Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed impetuously: <div class="bookquote">``I am ready, I am ready!
<p/>I am quite equal to answering you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katerina Ivanovna/Katerina</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) added, evidently still afraid that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) would somehow be prevented from giving evidence.
<p/>I only remember how they began examining the witness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was asked to explain in detail what this letter was and under what circumstances she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) received it.
<p/>I received it the day before the crime was committed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) wrote it the day before that, at the tavern--that is, two days before he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) committed the crime.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) hated me at that time, because he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had behaved contemptibly and was running after that creature ... and because he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) owed me that three thousand...
<p/>'' Look, it is written on some sort of bill! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) cried breathlessly. '' Oh! he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was humiliated by that three thousand on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) own meanness!
<p/>This is how it happened about that three thousand. I beg you, I beseech you, to hear me. Three weeks before he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) came to me one morning.
<p/>I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was in want of money, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) wanted it for. Yes, yes--to win that creature and carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) off.
<p/>I knew then that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had been false to me and meant to abandon me, and it was I, I, who gave him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) that money, who offered it to him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) on the pretext of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) sending it to my sister in Moscow.
<p/>And as I gave it him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>), I looked him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) in the face and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) could send it when he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) liked, `in a month's time would do.'
<p/>How, how could he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) have failed to understand that I was practically telling him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) face, `You want money to be false to me with your creature, so here's the money for you.
<p/>I give it to you myself. Take it, if you have so little honor as to take it!' I wanted to prove what he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was, and what happened?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) took it, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) took it, and squandered it with that creature in one night.... But he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) knew, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) knew that I knew all about it.
<p/>I assure you he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) understood, too, that I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) that money to test him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>), to see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was so lost to all sense of honor as to take it from me.
<p/>I looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) eyes and he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) looked into mine, and he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) understood it all and he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) took it--he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) carried off my money!''
<p/>That's true, Katya,'' Mitya roared suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``I looked into your eyes and I knew that you were dishonoring me, and yet I took your money.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>Despise me as a scoundrel, despise me, all of you! I've deserved it!'' <div class="bookquote">``Prisoner,''  (<font color='red'><b>the President</b></font>)</div>cried the President, <div class="bookquote">``another word and I will order you to be removed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the President</b></font>)</div><p/>'' That money was a torment to him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>),'' Katya went on with impulsive haste. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) wanted to repay it me.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) father, but he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) didn't repay me, and went off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) to that village where he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) was arrested.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) wanted to, that's true; but he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) needed money for that creature, too. There, again, he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) squandered the money he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had stolen after the murder of his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) father.
<p/>And a day before the murder he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) wrote me this letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) was drunk when he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) wrote it. I saw it at once, at the time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) wrote it from spite, and feeling certain, positively certain, that I should never show it to any one, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) did kill him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>), or else he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) wouldn't have written it.
<p/>But read it, read it attentively--more attentively, please--and you will see that he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had described it all in his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) letter, all beforehand, how he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) would kill his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) father and where his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) money was kept.
<p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) knew I shouldn't want to revenge myself and ruin him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>)! Look, please, don't overlook that, there's one phrase there, 'I shall kill him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) as soon as Ivan has gone away.'
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) thought it all out beforehand how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) would kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>),'' Katerina Ivanovna pointed out to the court with venomous and malignant triumph.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) hadn't been drunk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) wouldn't have written to me; but, look, everything is written there beforehand, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) committed the murder after.
<p/>Oh! it was clear she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had studied every line of that letter and detected every meaning underlining it. '' A complete program of it!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) was reckless now of all consequences to herself, though, no doubt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had foreseen them even a month ago, for even then, perhaps, shaking with anger, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had pondered whether to show it at the trial or not.
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) exclaimed frantically. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had taken the fatal plunge. I remember that the letter was read aloud by the clerk, directly afterwards, I believe.
<p/>It made an overwhelming impression. They asked Mitya whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) admitted having written the letter. '' It's mine, mine! '' cried Mitya.
<p/>We've hated each other for many things, Katya, but I swear, I swear I loved you even while I hated you, and you didn't love me!''
<p/>'' I shouldn't have written it, if I hadn't been drunk!... He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sank back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seat, wringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands in despair.
<p/>The prosecutor and counsel for the defense began cross-examining her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>), chiefly to ascertain what had induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) to conceal such a document and to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) evidence in quite a different tone and spirit just before.
<p/>I was lying against my honor and my conscience, but I wanted to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) has hated and despised me so!''
<p/>Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) has despised me horribly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) has always despised me, and do you know, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) has despised me from the very moment that I bowed down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) for that money.
<p/>'' Yes, yes. I was telling lies just now. Katya cried madly. '' I saw that.... I felt it at once at the time, but for a long time I wouldn't believe it.
<p/>Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) didn't understand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had no idea why I ran to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) can suspect nothing but baseness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) judged me by himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) thought every one was like himself!''
<p/>How often I have read it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) eyes, `You came of yourself, though.' Katya hissed furiously, in a perfect frenzy.
<p/>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) only wanted to marry me, because I'd inherited a fortune, because of that, because of that! I always suspected it was because of that!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was always convinced that I should be trembling with shame all my life before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), because I went to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) then, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had a right to despise me for ever for it, and so to be superior to me
<p/>Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is a brute! --that's why he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wanted to marry me! That's so , that's all so! I tried to conquer him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) by my love--a love that knew no bounds.
<p/>I even tried to forgive his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) faithlessness; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) understood nothing, nothing! How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) understand indeed? He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is a monster!
<p/>I only received that letter the next evening: it was brought me from the tavern--and only that morning, only that morning I wanted to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) everything, everything--even his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) treachery!''
<p/>The President and the prosecutor, of course, tried to calm her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). I can't help thinking that they felt ashamed of taking advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hysteria and of listening to such avowals.
<p/>I remember hearing them say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``We understand how hard it is for you; be sure we are able to feel for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and so on, and so on.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) described at last with extraordinary clearness, which is so often seen, though only for a moment, in such over-wrought states, how Ivan had been nearly driven out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) mind during the last two months trying to save <div class="bookquote">``the monster and murderer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ivan/Ivan Fyodorovitch/Ivan Karamazov</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) tortured himself,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) was always trying to minimize his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) brother's guilt and confessing to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), too, had never loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) father, and perhaps desired his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) death himself.
<p/>And yet they dragged the evidence out of the raving, hysterical woman. Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) has a tender, over- tender conscience! He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) tormented himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) conscience!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) told me everything, everything! He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) came every day and talked to me as his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) only friend. I have the honor to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) only friend!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried suddenly with a sort of defiance, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes flashed. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had been twice to see Smerdyakov.
<p/>One day he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) came to me and said, `If it was not my brother, but Smerdyakov committed the murder' -LRB-for the legend was circulating everywhere that Smerdyakov had done it-RRB-, `perhaps I too am guilty, for Smerdyakov knew I didn't like my father and perhaps believed that I desired my father's death.'
<p/>Then I brought out that letter and showed it him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was entirely convinced that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brother had done it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was overwhelmed by it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) couldn't endure the thought that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own brother was a parricide! Only a week ago I saw that it was making him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ill.
<p/>During the last few days he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has talked incoherently in my presence. I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind was giving way. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) walked about, raving; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was seen muttering in the streets.
<p/>The doctor from Moscow, at my request, examined him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) the day before yesterday and told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was on the eve of brain fever--and all on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) account, on account of this monster!
<p/>It was such a shock that it drove him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) mind ... and all through this monster, all for the sake of saving the monster!''
<p/>Oh, of course, such an outpouring, such an avowal is only possible once in a lifetime--at the hour of death, for instance, on the way to the scaffold!
<p/>And last night he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) learnt that Smerdyakov was dead! But it was in Katya's character, and it was such a moment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) life.
<p/>It was the same impetuous Katya who had thrown herself on the mercy of a young profligate to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) father; the same Katya who had just before, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) pride and chastity, sacrificed herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) maidenly modesty before all these people, telling of Mitya's generous conduct, in the hope of softening his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) fate a little.
<p/>And now, again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) sacrificed herself; but this time it was for another, and perhaps only now--perhaps only at this moment--she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) felt and knew how dear that other was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>)!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) had sacrificed herself in terror for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), conceiving all of a sudden that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had ruined himself by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) confession that it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) who had committed the murder, not his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) brother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) had sacrificed herself to save him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) good name, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) reputation!
<p/>And yet one terrible doubt occurred to one--was she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) lying in her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) description of her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) former relations with Mitya?--that was the question.
<p/>No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) had not intentionally slandered him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) cried that Mitya despised her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) bowing down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) believed it herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) had been firmly convinced, perhaps ever since that bow, that the simple-hearted Mitya, who even then adored her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>), was laughing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) and despising her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) with an hysterical, <div class="bookquote">``lacerated''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>love only from pride, from wounded pride, and that love was not like love, but more like revenge.
<p/>Oh! perhaps that lacerated love would have grown into real love, perhaps Katya longed for nothing more than that, but Mitya's faithlessness had wounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) to the bottom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) heart, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) heart could not forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>The moment of revenge had come upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) suddenly, and all that had been accumulating so long and so painfully in the offended woman's breast burst out all at once and unexpectedly.
<p/>And no sooner had she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) given full expression to her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) feelings than the tension of course was over and she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) was overwhelmed with shame.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) betrayed Mitya, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) betrayed herself, too. Hysterics began again: she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) fell on the floor, sobbing and screaming. She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) was carried out.
<p/>At that moment Grushenka, with a wail, rushed towards Mitya before they had time to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>). '' Mitya,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) wailed, <div class="bookquote">``your serpent has destroyed you!
<p/>There, she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) has shown you what she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) shouted to the judges, shaking with anger. At a signal from the President they seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) and tried to remove her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) from the court.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) wouldn't allow it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) fought and struggled to get back to Mitya. Mitya uttered a cry and struggled to get to her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>).
<p/>Yes, I think the ladies who came to see the spectacle must have been satisfied--the show had been a varied one.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was overpowered. Then I remember the Moscow doctor appeared on the scene. I believe the President had previously sent the court usher to arrange for medical aid for Ivan.
<p/>The doctor announced to the court that the sick man was suffering from a dangerous attack of brain fever, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be at once removed.
<p/>In answer to questions from the prosecutor and the counsel for the defense he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) said that the patient had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) own accord the day before yesterday and that he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had warned him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had such an attack coming on, but he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had not consented to be looked after.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) was certainly not in a normal state of mind: he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) told me himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) saw visions when he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) was awake, that he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) met several persons in the street, who were dead, and that Satan visited him (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) every evening,'' said the doctor, in conclusion.
<p/>'' Having given his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) evidence, the celebrated doctor withdrew. The letter produced by Katerina Ivanovna was added to the material proofs.
<p/>After some deliberation, the judges decided to proceed with the trial and to enter both the unexpected pieces of evidence -LRB-given by Ivan and Katerina Ivanovna-RRB- on the protocol.
<p/>But I will not detail the evidence of the other witnesses, who only repeated and confirmed what had been said before, though all with their characteristic peculiarities.
<p/>Every one was excited, every one was electrified by the late catastrophe, and all were awaiting the speeches for the prosecution and the defense with intense impatience.
<p/>I repeat, all was brought together in the prosecutor's speech, which I shall quote immediately. Fetyukovitch was obviously shaken by Katerina Ivanovna's evidence.
<p/>I believe it was just eight o'clock when the President returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) seat and our prosecutor, Ippolit Kirillovitch, began his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) speech.
<p/>But the prosecutor was triumphant. When all the evidence had been taken, the court was adjourned for almost an hour. Chapter VI.
<p/>Sketches Of Character Ippolit Kirillovitch began his (<font color='blue'><b>Character</b></font>) speech, trembling with nervousness, with cold sweat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Character</b></font>) forehead, feeling hot and cold all over by turns.
<p/>The Prosecutor's Speech. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) described this himself afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) regarded this speech as his (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) chef- d'oeuvre , the chef-d'oeuvre of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) whole life, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) swan-song.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) died, it is true, nine months later of rapid consumption, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) had the right, as it turned out, to compare himself to a swan singing his (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) last song.
<p/>And poor Ippolit Kirillovitch unexpectedly revealed that at least some feeling for the public welfare and <div class="bookquote">``the eternal question''  (<font color='red'><b>Ippolit Kirillovitch/Ippolit</b></font>)</div>lay concealed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) had put his (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) whole heart and all the brain he (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) had into that speech. Where his (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) speech really excelled was in its sincerity.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) genuinely believed in the prisoner's guilt; he (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) was accusing him (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) not as an official duty only, and in calling for vengeance he (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) quivered with a genuine passion <div class="bookquote">``for the security of society.
<p/>Even the ladies in the audience, though they remained hostile to Ippolit Kirillovitch, admitted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) made an extraordinary impression on them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) began in a breaking voice, but it soon gained strength and filled the court to the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) speech.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) had finished, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) almost fainted. '' Gentlemen of the jury,'' began the prosecutor, <div class="bookquote">``this case has made a stir throughout Russia.
<p/>But what is there to wonder at, what is there so peculiarly horrifying in it for us? We are so accustomed to such crimes!
<p/>That's what's so horrible, that such dark deeds have ceased to horrify us. What ought to horrify us is that we are so accustomed to it, and not this or that isolated crime.
<p/>What are the causes of our indifference, our lukewarm attitude to such deeds, to such signs of the times, ominous of an unenviable future?
<p/>Is it our cynicism, is it the premature exhaustion of intellect and imagination in a society that is sinking into decay, in spite of its youth?
<p/>Is it that our moral principles are shattered to their foundations, or is it, perhaps, a complete lack of such principles among us?
<p/>I cannot answer such questions; nevertheless they are disturbing, and every citizen not only must, but ought to be harassed by them.
<p/>Our newborn and still timid press has done good service to the public already, for without it we should never have heard of the horrors of unbridled violence and moral degradation which are continually made known by the press, not merely to those who attend the new jury courts established in the present reign, but to every one.
<p/>But what is most important is that the majority of our national crimes of violence bear witness to a widespread evil, now so general among us that it is difficult to contend against it.
<p/>And what do we read almost daily? Of things beside which the present case grows pale, and seems almost commonplace. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div><p/>One day we see a brilliant young officer of high society, at the very outset of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) career, in a cowardly underhand way, without a pang of conscience, murdering an official who had once been his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) benefactor, and the servant girl, to steal his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) own I.O.U. and what ready money he (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) could find on him (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>); `it will come in handy for my pleasures in the fashionable world and for my career in the future.'
<p/>Next, a young hero `decorated for bravery' kills the mother of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) chief and benefactor, like a highwayman, and to urge his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) companions to join him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) asserts that `she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) like a son, and so will follow all his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) directions and take no precautions.'
<p/>After murdering them, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) puts pillows under the head of each of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) victims; he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) goes away. Granted that he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) is a monster, yet I dare not say in these days that he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) is unique.
<p/>In silence, alone with his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) conscience, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) asks himself perhaps, `What is honor, and isn't the condemnation of bloodshed a prejudice?'
<p/>Another man will not commit the murder, but will feel and think like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and is as dishonorable in soul. ''
<p/>Perhaps people will cry out against me that I am morbid, hysterical, that it is a monstrous slander, that I am exaggerating.
<p/>Oh, don't believe me, think of me as morbid, but remember my words; if only a tenth, if only a twentieth part of what I say is true--even so it's awful!
<p/>Look how our young people commit suicide, without asking themselves Hamlet's question what there is beyond, without a sign of such a question, as though all that relates to the soul and to what awaits us beyond the grave had long been erased in their minds and buried under the sands.
<p/>Let them say so--and heavens! I should be the first to rejoice if it were so! Look at our vice, at our profligates.
<p/>Fyodor Pavlovitch, the luckless victim in the present case, was almost an innocent babe compared with many of them. And yet we all knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), `he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) lived among us!'...
<p/>Yes, one day perhaps the leading intellects of Russia and of Europe will study the psychology of Russian crime, for the subject is worth it.
<p/>But this study will come later, at leisure, when all the tragic topsy-turvydom of to-day is farther behind us, so that it's possible to examine it with more insight and more impartiality than I can do.
<p/>Now we are either horrified or pretend to be horrified, though we really gloat over the spectacle, and love strong and eccentric sensations which tickle our cynical, pampered idleness.
<p/>Or, like little children, we brush the dreadful ghosts away and hide our heads in the pillow so as to return to our sports and merriment as soon as they have vanished.
<p/>But we must one day begin life in sober earnest, we must look at ourselves as a society; it's time we tried to grasp something of our social position, or at least to make a beginning in that direction.
<p/>A great writer-LRB-9-RRB- of the last epoch, comparing Russia to a swift troika galloping to an unknown goal, exclaims, `Oh, troika, birdlike troika, who invented thee!'
<p/>and adds, in proud ecstasy, that all the peoples of the world stand aside respectfully to make way for the recklessly galloping troika to pass.
<p/>That may be, they may stand aside, respectfully or no, but in my poor opinion the great writer ended his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) book in this way either in an access of childish and naďve optimism, or simply in fear of the censorship of the day.
<p/>For if the troika were drawn by his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) heroes, Sobakevitch, Nozdryov, Tchitchikov, it could reach no rational goal, whoever might be driving it.
<p/>'' '' And those were the heroes of an older generation, ours are worse specimens still... '' At this point Ippolit Kirillovitch's speech was interrupted by applause.
<p/>The applause was, it's true, of brief duration, so that the President did not think it necessary to caution the public, and only looked severely in the direction of the offenders.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had been all his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) life unable to get a hearing, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) suddenly had an opportunity of securing the ear of all Russia.
<p/>The liberal significance of this simile was appreciated. But Ippolit Kirillovitch was encouraged; he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had never been applauded before! '' What, after all, is this Karamazov family, which has gained such an unenviable notoriety throughout Russia?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) continued.
<p/>Perhaps I am exaggerating, but it seems to me that certain fundamental features of the educated class of to-day are reflected in this family picture--only, of course, in miniature, `like the sun in a drop of water.'
<p/>Think of that unhappy, vicious, unbridled old man, who has met with such a melancholy end, the head of a family!
<p/>Beginning life of noble birth, but in a poor dependent position, through an unexpected marriage he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came into a small fortune.
<p/>A petty knave, a toady and buffoon, of fairly good, though undeveloped, intelligence, he (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) was, above all, a moneylender, who grew bolder with growing prosperity.
<p/>'' His (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) abject and servile characteristics disappeared, his (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) malicious and sarcastic cynicism was all that remained. On the spiritual side he (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) was undeveloped, while his (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) vitality was excessive.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) saw nothing in life but sensual pleasure, and he (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) brought his (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) children up to be the same. He (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) had no feelings for his (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) duties as a father.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) ridiculed those duties. He (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>buffoon</b></font>) little children to the servants, and was glad to be rid of them, forgot about them completely.
<p/>The old man's maxim was Aprčs moi le déluge . He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was an example of everything that is opposed to civic duty, of the most complete and malignant individualism. '
<p/>; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was content, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was eager to go on living in the same way for another twenty or thirty years.
<p/>The world may burn for aught I care, so long as I am all right,' and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was all right He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) swindled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own son and spent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) maternal inheritance, on trying to get his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mistress from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>I will speak the truth myself, I can well understand what resentment he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had heaped up in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son's heart against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>No, I don't intend to leave the prisoner's defense altogether to my talented colleague from Petersburg. '' But enough, enough of that unhappy old man; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has paid the penalty.
<p/>Let us remember, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a father, and one of the typical fathers of to-day. Am I unjust, indeed, in saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is typical of many modern fathers?
<p/>many of them only differ in not openly professing such cynicism, for they are better educated, more cultured, but their philosophy is essentially the same as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Alas! Perhaps I am a pessimist, but you have agreed to forgive me. Let us agree beforehand, you need not believe me, but let me speak.
<p/>Let me say what I have to say, and remember something of my words. '' Now for the children of this father, this head of a family.
<p/>One of them is the prisoner before us, all the rest of my speech will deal with him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>). Of the other two I will speak only cursorily.
<p/>The elder is one of those modern young men of brilliant education and vigorous intellect, who has lost all faith in everything.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) has denied and rejected much already, like his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) father. We have all heard him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was a welcome guest in local society.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) never concealed his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) opinions, quite the contrary in fact, which justifies me in speaking rather openly of him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) now, of course, not as an individual, but as a member of the Karamazov family.
<p/>Another personage closely connected with the case died here by his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) own hand last night. I mean an afflicted idiot, formerly the servant, and possibly the illegitimate son, of Fyodor Pavlovitch, Smerdyakov.
<p/>At the preliminary inquiry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) told me with hysterical tears how the young Ivan Karamazov had horrified him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) spiritual audacity. '
<p/>Everything in the world is lawful according to him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>), and nothing must be forbidden in the future--that is what he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) always taught me.'
<p/>I believe that idiot was driven out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) mind by this theory, though, of course, the epileptic attacks from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) suffered, and this terrible catastrophe, have helped to unhinge his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) faculties.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) dropped one very interesting observation, which would have done credit to a more intelligent observer, and that is, indeed, why I've mentioned it: `If there is one of the sons that is like Fyodor Pavlovitch in character, it is Ivan Fyodorovitch.'
<p/>'' With that remark I conclude my sketch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) character, feeling it indelicate to continue further. Oh, I don't want to draw any further conclusions and croak like a raven over the young man's future.
<p/>We've seen to-day in this court that there are still good impulses in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) young heart, that family feeling has not been destroyed in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by lack of faith and cynicism, which have come to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rather by inheritance than by the exercise of independent thought.
<p/>Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a devout and modest youth, who does not share his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elder brother's gloomy and destructive theory of life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has sought to cling to the `ideas of the people,' or to what goes by that name in some circles of our intellectual classes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seems to me to have betrayed unconsciously, and so early, that timid despair which leads so many in our unhappy society, who dread cynicism and its corrupting influences, and mistakenly attribute all the mischief to European enlightenment, to return to their `native soil,' as they say, to the bosom, so to speak, of their mother earth, like frightened children, yearning to fall asleep on the withered bosom of their decrepit mother, and to sleep there for ever, only to escape the horrors that terrify them.
<p/>For my part I wish the excellent and gifted young man every success; I trust that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) youthful idealism and impulse towards the ideas of the people may never degenerate, as often happens, on the moral side into gloomy mysticism, and on the political into blind chauvinism--two elements which are even a greater menace to Russia than the premature decay, due to misunderstanding and gratuitous adoption of European ideas, from which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elder brother is suffering.
<p/>'' Then the third son. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) clung to the monastery, and was within an ace of becoming a monk. '' ''
<p/>Two or three people clapped their hands at the mention of chauvinism and mysticism. Ippolit Kirillovitch had been, indeed, carried away by his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own eloquence.
<p/>All this had little to do with the case in hand, to say nothing of the fact of its being somewhat vague, but the sickly and consumptive man was overcome by the desire to express himself once in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life.
<p/>People said afterwards that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was actuated by unworthy motives in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) criticism of Ivan, because the latter had on one or two occasions got the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in argument, and Ippolit Kirillovitch, remembering it, tried now to take his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) revenge.
<p/>But I don't know whether it was true. All this was only introductory, however, and the speech passed to more direct consideration of the case.
<p/>We have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) actions, too, before us; the fatal day has come and all has been brought to the surface.
<p/>While his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brothers seem to stand for `Europeanism' and `the principles of the people,' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seems to represent Russia as she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is.
<p/>'' But to return to the eldest son,'' Ippolit Kirillovitch went on. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is the prisoner before us. Oh, not all Russia, not all!
<p/>God preserve us, if it were! Yet, here we have her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), our mother Russia, the very scent and sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is spontaneous, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is a marvelous mingling of good and evil, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is a lover of culture and Schiller, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) brawls in taverns and plucks out the beards of his (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) boon companions.
<p/>What is more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) can be carried off his (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) feet, positively carried off his (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) feet by noble ideals, but only if they come of themselves, if they fall from heaven for him (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>), if they need not be paid for.
<p/>Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>), too, can be good and noble, but only when all goes well with him (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) dislikes paying for anything, but is very fond of receiving, and that's so with him (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) in everything.
<p/>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) couldn't be content with less-RRB-, and put no obstacle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) way, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) will show that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>), too, can be noble.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) is not greedy, no, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) must have money, a great deal of money, and you will see how generously, with what scorn of filthy lucre, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) will fling it all away in the reckless dissipation of one night.
<p/>But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) has not money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) will show what he (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) is ready to do to get it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) is in great need of it.
<p/>Oh, give him (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) every possible good in life But all this later, let us take events in their chronological order. ''
<p/>First, we have before us a poor abandoned child, running about the back- yard `without boots on his (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) feet,' as our worthy and esteemed fellow citizen, of foreign origin, alas!
<p/>expressed it just now. I repeat it again, I yield to no one the defense of the criminal. I am here to accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>), but to defend him (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) also.
<p/>But the boy grows up and becomes an officer; for a duel and other reckless conduct he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) is exiled to one of the remote frontier towns of Russia.
<p/>Yes, I, too, am human; I, too, can weigh the influence of home and childhood on the character. There he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) led a wild life as an officer.
<p/>And, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) needed money, money before all things, and so after prolonged disputes he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) came to a settlement with his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) father, and the last six thousand was sent him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).
<p/>A letter is in existence in which he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) practically gives up his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) claim to the rest and settles his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) conflict with his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) father over the inheritance on the payment of this six thousand.
<p/>'' Then came his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) meeting with a young girl of lofty character and brilliant education. Oh, I do not venture to repeat the details; you have only just heard them.
<p/>The figure of the young officer, frivolous and profligate, doing homage to true nobility and a lofty ideal, was shown in a very sympathetic light before us.
<p/>Honor, self-sacrifice were shown there, and I will be silent. But the other side of the medal was unexpectedly turned to us immediately after in this very court.
<p/>The same lady, bathed in tears of long-concealed indignation, alleged that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) of all men, had despised her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) action, which, though incautious, reckless perhaps, was still dictated by lofty and generous motives.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), the girl's betrothed, looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with that smile of mockery, which was more insufferable from him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) than from any one.
<p/>And knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had already deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), believing that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was bound to endure everything from him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), even treachery-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) intentionally offered him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) three thousand roubles, and clearly, too clearly, let him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) understand that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was offering him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) money to deceive her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). '
<p/>Again I will not venture to conjecture why it happened so, but there were causes. Well, will you take it or not, are you so lost to shame?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), saw clearly what was in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)'s admitted here before you that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) understood it all-RRB-, appropriated that three thousand unconditionally, and squandered it in two days with the new object of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) affections.
<p/>The first legend of the young officer sacrificing his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) last farthing in a noble impulse of generosity and doing reverence to virtue, or this other revolting picture?
<p/>As a rule, between two extremes one has to find the mean, but in the present case this is not true.
<p/>' was the dumb question in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) scrutinizing eyes. '' What are we to believe then? The probability is that in the first case he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was genuinely noble, and in the second as genuinely base.
<p/>Because he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was of the broad Karamazov character--that's just what I am leading up to--capable of combining the most incongruous contradictions, and capable of the greatest heights and of the greatest depths.
<p/>Rakitin: `The sense of their own degradation is as essential to those reckless, unbridled natures as the sense of their lofty generosity.'
<p/>And why? Remember the brilliant remark made by a young observer who has seen the Karamazov family at close quarters--Mr. And that's true, they need continually this unnatural mixture.
<p/>Two extremes at the same moment, or they are miserable and dissatisfied and their existence is incomplete. They are wide, wide as mother Russia; they include everything and put up with everything.
<p/>By the way, gentlemen of the jury, we've just touched upon that three thousand roubles, and I will venture to anticipate things a little.
<p/>Can you conceive that a man like that, on receiving that sum and in such a way, at the price of such shame, such disgrace, such utter degradation, could have been capable that very day of setting apart half that sum, that very day, and sewing it up in a little bag, and would have had the firmness of character to carry it about with him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) for a whole month afterwards, in spite of every temptation and his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) extreme need of it!
<p/>Neither in drunken debauchery in taverns, nor when he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was flying into the country, trying to get from God knows whom, the money so essential to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to remove the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) affections from being tempted by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father, did he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) bring himself to touch that little bag!
<p/>Why, if only to avoid abandoning his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mistress to the rival of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was so jealous, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would have been certain to have opened that bag and to have stayed at home to keep watch over her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), and to await the moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) would say to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) at last 'I am yours,' and to fly with her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) far from their fatal surroundings.
<p/>The chief reason, as I have just said, was that when she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) would say, 'I am yours, take me where you will,' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) might have the wherewithal to take her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).
<p/>'' '' But no, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not touch his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) talisman, and what is the reason he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gives for it? But that first reason, in the prisoner's own words, was of little weight beside the second.
<p/>While I have that money on me, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, I am a scoundrel, not a thief, for I can always go to my insulted betrothed, and, laying down half the sum I have fraudulently appropriated, I can always say to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), `You see, I've squandered half your money, and shown I am a weak and immoral man, and, if you like, a scoundrel' -LRB-I use the prisoner's own expressions-RRB-, `but though I am a scoundrel, I am not a thief, for if I had been a thief, I shouldn't have brought you back this half of the money, but should have taken it as I did the other half!'
<p/>This frantic, but weak man, who could not resist the temptation of accepting the three thousand roubles at the price of such disgrace, this very man suddenly develops the most stoical firmness, and carries about a thousand roubles without daring to touch it.
<p/>No, and I venture to tell you how the real Dmitri Karamazov would have behaved in such circumstances, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) really had brought himself to put away the money.
<p/>At the first temptation--for instance, to entertain the woman with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) had already squandered half the money--he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) would have unpicked his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) little bag and have taken out some hundred roubles, for why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) have taken back precisely half the money,
<p/>A marvelous explanation! Does that fit in at all with the character we have analyzed? '' that is, fifteen hundred roubles?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) could just as well have said then that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was not a thief, because he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) brought back fourteen hundred roubles.
<p/>Then another time he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) would have unpicked it again and taken out another hundred, and then a third, and then a fourth, and before the end of the month he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) would have taken the last note but one, feeling that if he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) took back only a hundred it would answer the purpose, for a thief would have stolen it all.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) would have looked at this last note, and have said to himself, `It's really not worth while to give back one hundred; let's spend that, too!'
<p/>why not fourteen hundred? That's how the real Dmitri Karamazov, as we know him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>), would have behaved. One cannot imagine anything more incongruous with the actual fact than this legend of the little bag.
<p/>After touching upon what had come out in the proceedings concerning the financial relations of father and son, and arguing again and again that it was utterly impossible, from the facts known, to determine which was in the wrong, Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to the evidence of the medical experts in reference to Mitya's fixed idea about the three thousand owing him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>An Historical Survey <div class="bookquote">``The medical experts have striven to convince us that the prisoner is out of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) mind and, in fact, a maniac.
<p/>I maintain that he (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) is in his (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) right mind, and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) had not been, he (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) would have behaved more cleverly.
<p/>As for his (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) being a maniac, that I would agree with, but only in one point, that is, his (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) fixed idea about the three thousand.
<p/>Nothing could be more inconceivable. But we shall return to that later. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Chapter VII. Yet I think one might find a much simpler cause than his (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) tendency to insanity.
<p/>For my part I agree thoroughly with the young doctor who maintained that the prisoner's mental faculties have always been normal, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) has only been irritable and exasperated.
<p/>The object of the prisoner's continual and violent anger was not the sum itself; there was a special motive at the bottom of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) began from the moment when the prisoner went to the <div class="bookquote">``young person's''  (<font color='red'><b>the prisoner</b></font>)</div>lodgings <div class="bookquote">``to beat her (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)'' (<font color='red'><b>the prisoner</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``I use his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own expression,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prisoner</b></font>)</div>the prosecutor explained--<div class="bookquote">``but instead of beating her (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) remained there, at her (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) feet.
<p/>That motive is jealousy!''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div>Here Ippolit Kirillovitch described at length the prisoner's fatal passion for Grushenka. That was the beginning of the passion.
<p/>At the same time the prisoner's father was captivated by the same young person--a strange and fatal coincidence, for they both lost their hearts to her (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) simultaneously, though both had known her (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) before.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) inspired in both of them the most violent, characteristically Karamazov passion. We have her (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own confession: 'I was laughing at both of them.'
<p/>Yes, the sudden desire to make a jest of them came over her (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) conquered both of them at once.
<p/>The old man, who worshiped money, at once set aside three thousand roubles as a reward for one visit from her (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), but soon after that, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have been happy to lay his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) property and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name at her (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) feet, if only she (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would become his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lawful wife.
<p/>We have good evidence of this. As for the prisoner, the tragedy of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) fate is evident; it is before us.
<p/>The enchantress gave the unhappy young man no hope until the last moment, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knelt before her (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), stretching out hands that were already stained with the blood of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father and rival.
<p/>Send me to Siberia with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to this, I am most to blame,' the woman herself cried, in genuine remorse at the moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arrest.
<p/>The talented young man, to whom I have referred already, Mr. Rakitin, characterized this heroine in brief and impressive terms: `She (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) was disillusioned early in life, deceived and ruined by a betrothed, who seduced and abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) was left in poverty, cursed by her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) respectable family, and taken under the protection of a wealthy old man, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) still, however, considers as her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) benefactor.
<p/>But such was the young person's `game.' It was in that position that he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>) was arrested. ' '' There was perhaps much that was good in her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) young heart, but it was embittered too early.
<p/>After this sketch of her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) character it may well be understood that she (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) might laugh at both of them simply from mischief, from malice.
<p/>After a month of hopeless love and moral degradation, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) betrayed his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) betrothed and appropriated money entrusted to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) honor, the prisoner was driven almost to frenzy, almost to madness by continual jealousy--and of whom?
<p/>And the worst of it was that the crazy old man was alluring and enticing the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affection by means of that very three thousand roubles, which the son looked upon as his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own property, part of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) inheritance from his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother, of which his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father was cheating him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) became prudent and saved money. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grew sarcastic and resentful against society.' '' His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father! Yes, I admit it was hard to bear!
<p/>It was not the money, but the fact that this money was used with such revolting cynicism to ruin his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) happiness!''
<p/>Then the prosecutor went on to describe how the idea of murdering his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father had entered the prisoner's head, and illustrated his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) theory with facts.
<p/>It might well drive a man to madness. '' At first he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only talked about it in taverns--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was talking about it all that month.
<p/>Ah, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes being always surrounded with company, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companions everything, even his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) most diabolical and dangerous ideas; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes to share every thought with others, and expects, for some reason, that those he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) confides in will meet him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with perfect sympathy, enter into all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) troubles and anxieties, take his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) part and not oppose him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in anything.
<p/>If not, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flies into a rage and smashes up everything in the tavern. -LSB-Then followed the anecdote about Captain Snegiryov.-RSB-
<p/>Those who heard the prisoner began to think at last that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) might mean more than threats, and that such a frenzy might turn threats into actions.
<p/>Here the prosecutor described the meeting of the family at the monastery, the conversations with Alyosha, and the horrible scene of violence when the prisoner had rushed into his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) father's house just after dinner.
<p/>'' '' I cannot positively assert,'' the prosecutor continued, <div class="bookquote">``that the prisoner fully intended to murder his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) father before that incident.
<p/>Yet the idea had several times presented itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had deliberated on it--for that we have facts, witnesses, and his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own words.
<p/>I confess, gentlemen of the jury,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``that till to-day I have been uncertain whether to attribute to the prisoner conscious premeditation.
<p/>I was firmly convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had pictured the fatal moment beforehand, but had only pictured it, contemplating it as a possibility.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had not definitely considered when and how he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) might commit the crime. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But I was only uncertain till to-day, till that fatal document was presented to the court just now.
<p/>You yourselves heard that young lady's exclamation, `It is the plan, the program of the murder!' That is how she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) defined that miserable, drunken letter of the unhappy prisoner.
<p/>It was written two days before, and so we know now for a fact that, forty-eight hours before the perpetration of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) terrible design, the prisoner swore that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) could not get money next day, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would murder his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) father in order to take the envelope with the notes from under his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) pillow, as soon as Ivan had left. '
<p/>As soon as Ivan had gone away'--you hear that; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had thought everything out, weighing every circumstance, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) carried it all out just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had written it.
<p/>The proof of premeditation is conclusive; the crime must have been committed for the sake of the money, that is stated clearly, that is written and signed.
<p/>And, in fact, from that letter we see that the whole fact of the murder was premeditated. The prisoner does not deny his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) signature.
<p/>But that does not diminish the value of the letter, quite the contrary; he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) wrote when drunk what he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had planned when sober.
<p/>'' I shall be told he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was drunk when he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) wrote it. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) not planned it when sober, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would not have written it when drunk.
<p/>I shall be asked: Then why did he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) talk about it in taverns? A man who premeditates such a crime is silent and keeps it to himself.
<p/>Yes, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talked about it before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had formed a plan, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had only the desire, only the impulse to it.
<p/>On the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote that letter at the `Metropolis' tavern, contrary to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) custom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was silent, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been drinking.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did indeed turn a shopman out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seat, but that was done almost unconsciously, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could never enter a tavern without making a disturbance.
<p/>It is true that after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had taken the final decision, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have felt apprehensive that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had talked too much about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) design beforehand, and that this might lead to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arrest and prosecution afterwards.
<p/>But there was nothing for it; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not take his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) words back, but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) luck had served him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before, it would serve him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again.
<p/>Afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talked less about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not play billiards, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat in a corner, talked to no one. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) star, you know!
<p/>To-morrow I shall try and borrow the money from every one,' as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) writes in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) peculiar language, `and if they won't give it to me, there will be bloodshed.'
<p/>I must confess, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did a great deal to avoid the fatal catastrophe. ' '' Here Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to a detailed description of all Mitya's efforts to borrow the money.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harassed, jeered at, hungry, after selling his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) watch to pay for the journey -LRB-though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) tells us he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had fifteen hundred roubles on him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)--a likely story-RRB-, tortured by jealousy at having left the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) affections in the town, suspecting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would go to Fyodor Pavlovitch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) absence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) returned at last to the town, to find, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) joy, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had not been near his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) father.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) described his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) visit to Samsonov, his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) journey to Lyagavy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) protector. -LRB-Strange to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) doesn't seem to have been jealous of Samsonov, which is psychologically interesting.-RRB-
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) hastens back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) ambush in the back gardens, and there learns that Smerdyakov is in a fit, that the other servant is ill--the coast is clear and he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) knows the `signals'--what a temptation!
<p/>Still he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) resists it; he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) goes off to a lady who has for some time been residing in the town, and who is highly esteemed among us, Madame Hohlakov.
<p/>That lady, who had long watched his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) career with compassion, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) the most judicious advice, to give up his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) dissipated life, his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) unseemly love-affair, the waste of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) youth and vigor in pot-house debauchery, and to set off to Siberia to the gold- mines: `that would be an outlet for your turbulent energies, your romantic character, your thirst for adventure.'
<p/>After describing the result of this conversation and the moment when the prisoner learnt that Grushenka had not remained at Samsonov's, the sudden frenzy of the luckless man worn out with jealousy and nervous exhaustion, at the thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had deceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) and was now with his (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) father, Ippolit Kirillovitch concluded by dwelling upon the fatal influence of chance.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the maid</b></font>)</div>'' Had the maid told him (<font color='blue'><b>Samsonov</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) mistress was at Mokroe with her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) former lover, nothing would have happened.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) lost her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) could only swear and protest her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) ignorance, and if the prisoner did not kill her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) on the spot, it was only because he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) flew in pursuit of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) false mistress.
<p/>'' But note, frantic as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) took with him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) a brass pestle. Why that? Why not some other weapon?
<p/>But since he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had been contemplating his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) plan and preparing himself for it for a whole month, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would snatch up anything like a weapon that caught his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) eye.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had realized for a month past that any object of the kind would serve as a weapon, so he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) instantly, without hesitation, recognized that it would serve his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) purpose.
<p/>So it was by no means unconsciously, by no means involuntarily, that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) snatched up that fatal pestle. And then we find him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) father's garden--
<p/>The suspicion that she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) was there, with him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) rival, in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) arms, and perhaps laughing at him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) at that moment--took his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) breath away.
<p/>the coast is clear, there are no witnesses, darkness and jealousy. And it was not mere suspicion, the deception was open, obvious.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) must be there, in that lighted room, she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) must be behind the screen; and the unhappy man would have us believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stole up to the window, peeped respectfully in, and discreetly withdrew, for fear something terrible and immoral should happen.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tries to persuade us of that, us, who understand his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character, who know his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) state of mind at the moment, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew the signals by which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could at once enter the house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did this very circumstantially, and every one realized that, although he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) professed to despise that suspicion, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought the subject of great importance.
<p/>'' At this point Ippolit Kirillovitch broke off to discuss exhaustively the suspected connection of Smerdyakov with the murder. Chapter VIII.
<p/>The first person who cried out that Smerdyakov had committed the murder was the prisoner himself at the moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) arrest, yet from that time to this he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had not brought forward a single fact to confirm the charge, nor the faintest suggestion of a fact.
<p/>A Treatise On Smerdyakov <div class="bookquote">``To begin with, what was the source of this suspicion? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Ippolit Kirillovitch began.-RRB- '' The charge is confirmed by three persons only--the two brothers of the prisoner and Madame Svyetlov.
<p/>But we know that for the last two months he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) has completely shared our conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) brother's guilt and did not attempt to combat that idea.
<p/>The elder of these brothers expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) suspicions only to-day, when he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was undoubtedly suffering from brain fever. But of that later.
<p/>The younger brother has admitted that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has not the slightest fact to support his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) notion of Smerdyakov's guilt, and has only been led to that conclusion from the prisoner's own words and the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) face.
<p/>Yes, that astounding piece of evidence has been brought forward twice to- day by him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>). Madame Svyetlov was even more astounding. '
<p/>That is all the evidence against Smerdyakov produced by these three persons, who are all deeply concerned in the prisoner's fate.
<p/>What the prisoner tells you, you must believe; he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) is not a man to tell a lie.' And yet the theory of Smerdyakov's guilt has been noised about, has been and is still maintained.
<p/>Here Ippolit Kirillovitch thought it necessary to describe the personality of Smerdyakov, <div class="bookquote">``who had cut short his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) life in a fit of insanity.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) depicted him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) as a man of weak intellect, with a smattering of education, who had been thrown off his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) balance by philosophical ideas above his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) level and certain modern theories of duty, which he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) learnt in practice from the reckless life of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) master, who was also perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) father--Fyodor Pavlovitch; and, theoretically, from various strange philosophical conversations with his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) master's elder son, Ivan Fyodorovitch, who readily indulged in this diversion, probably feeling dull or wishing to amuse himself at the valet's expense.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) spoke to me himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) spiritual condition during the last few days at his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) father's house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Smerdyakov</b></font>)</div>Ippolit Kirillovitch explained; <div class="bookquote">``but others too have borne witness to it--the prisoner himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) brother, and the servant Grigory--that is, all who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) well.
<p/>Is it credible? Is it conceivable?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ippolit Kirillovitch/Ippolit</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' Moreover, Smerdyakov, whose health was shaken by his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) attacks of epilepsy, had not the courage of a chicken. '
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) fell at my feet and kissed them,' the prisoner himself has told us, before he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) realized how damaging such a statement was to himself. '
<p/>And the prisoner chose him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) confidant -LRB-we have his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own word for it-RRB- and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) into consenting at last to act as a spy for him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
<p/>In that capacity he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) deceived his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) master, revealing to the prisoner the existence of the envelope with the notes in it and the signals by means of which he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) could get into the house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) is an epileptic chicken,' he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) declared about him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) characteristic language. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) help telling him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), indeed? '
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would have killed me, I could see that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would have killed me,' he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) said at the inquiry, trembling and shaking even before us, though his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) tormentor was by that time arrested and could do him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) no harm. '
<p/>In fear and trembling I hastened to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) every secret to pacify him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) might see that I had not deceived him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) and let me off alive.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) suspected me at every instant. Those are his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own words. I wrote them down and I remember them. ' When he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) began shouting at me, I would fall on my knees.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was naturally very honest and enjoyed the complete confidence of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) master, ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had restored him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) some money he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had lost.
<p/>So it may be supposed that the poor fellow suffered pangs of remorse at having deceived his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) master, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) loved as his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) benefactor.
<p/>'' Persons severely afflicted with epilepsy are, so the most skillful doctors tell us, always prone to continual and morbid self-reproach.
<p/>They worry over their `wickedness,' they are tormented by pangs of conscience, often entirely without cause; they exaggerate and often invent all sorts of faults and crimes.
<p/>And here we have a man of that type who had really been driven to wrong-doing by terror and intimidation. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, besides, a strong presentiment that something terrible would be the outcome of the situation that was developing before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>When Ivan Fyodorovitch was leaving for Moscow, just before the catastrophe, Smerdyakov besought him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) to remain, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was too timid to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) plainly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) feared.
<p/>It must be observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) looked on Ivan Fyodorovitch as a protector, whose presence in the house was a guarantee that no harm would come to pass.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) confined himself to hints, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) hints were not understood. '' Remember the phrase in Dmitri Karamazov's drunken letter, 'I shall kill the old man, if only Ivan goes away.'
<p/>So Ivan Fyodorovitch's presence seemed to every one a guarantee of peace and order in the house. '' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) went away, and within an hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) young master's departure Smerdyakov was taken with an epileptic fit.
<p/>Here I must mention that Smerdyakov, oppressed by terror and despair of a sort, had felt during those last few days that one of the fits from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) had suffered before at moments of strain, might be coming upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) again.
<p/>The day and hour of such an attack cannot, of course, be foreseen, but every epileptic can feel beforehand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) is likely to have one.
<p/>And so, as soon as Ivan Fyodorovitch had driven out of the yard, Smerdyakov, depressed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) lonely and unprotected position, went to the cellar.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) went down the stairs wondering if he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) would have a fit or not, and what if it were to come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) at once.
<p/>And that very apprehension, that very wonder, brought on the spasm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) throat that always precedes such attacks, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) fell unconscious into the cellar.
<p/>And in this perfectly natural occurrence people try to detect a suspicion, a hint that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was shamming an attack on purpose .
<p/>But that's perfectly intelligible. So the doctors tell us. But, if it were on purpose, the question arises at once, what was his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) motive?
<p/>I say nothing about medicine: science, I am told, may go astray: the doctors were not able to discriminate between the counterfeit and the real.
<p/>What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) reckoning on? What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) aiming at? That may be so, but answer me one question: what motive had he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) for such a counterfeit?
<p/>Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), had he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) been plotting the murder, have desired to attract the attention of the household by having a fit just before?
<p/>You see, gentlemen of the jury, on the night of the murder, there were five persons in Fyodor Pavlovitch's--Fyodor Pavlovitch himself -LRB-but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) did not kill himself,
<p/>that's evident-RRB-; then his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) servant, Grigory, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was almost killed himself; the third person was Grigory's wife, Marfa Ignatyevna, but it would be simply shameful to imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) murdering her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) master.
<p/>But, if we are to believe the prisoner's statement that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) is not the murderer, then Smerdyakov must have been, for there is no other alternative, no one else can be found.
<p/>'' Two persons are left--the prisoner and Smerdyakov. That is what accounts for the artful, astounding accusation against the unhappy idiot who committed suicide yesterday.
<p/>Had a shadow of suspicion rested on any one else, had there been any sixth person, I am persuaded that even the prisoner would have been ashamed to accuse Smerdyakov, and would have accused that sixth person, for to charge Smerdyakov with that murder is perfectly absurd.
<p/>Gentlemen, let us lay aside psychology, let us lay aside medicine, let us even lay aside logic, let us turn only to the facts and see what the facts tell us.
<p/>'' If Smerdyakov killed him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), how did he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) do it? Alone or with the assistance of the prisoner? Let us consider the first alternative--that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) did it alone.
<p/>But not having a shadow of the motive that the prisoner had for the murder--hatred, jealousy, and so on--Smerdyakov could only have murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) for the sake of gain, in order to appropriate the three thousand roubles he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) master put in the envelope.
<p/>And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) tells another person--and a person most closely interested, that is, the prisoner--everything about the money and the signals, where the envelope lay, what was written on it, what it was tied up with, and, above all, told him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) of those signals by which he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) could enter the house.
<p/>Did he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) do this simply to betray himself, or to invite to the same enterprise one who would be anxious to get that envelope for himself? '
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had killed him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) it must have been with some object, for some advantage to himself. Yes,' I shall be told, `but he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) betrayed it from fear.'
<p/>A man who could conceive such an audacious, savage act, and carry it out, tells facts which are known to no one else in the world, and which, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tongue, no one would ever have guessed! ''
<p/>No, however cowardly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might be, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had plotted such a crime, nothing would have induced him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to tell any one about the envelope and the signals, for that was as good as betraying himself beforehand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have invented something, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have told some lie if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been forced to give information, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have been silent about that.
<p/>For, on the other hand, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had said nothing about the money, but had committed the murder and stolen the money, no one in the world could have charged him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with murder for the sake of robbery, since no one but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen the money, no one
<p/>Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been accused of the murder, it could only have been thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had committed it from some other motive.
<p/>But since no one had observed any such motive in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beforehand, and every one saw, on the contrary, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master was fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and honored him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) confidence, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would, of course, have been the last to be suspected.
<p/>People would have suspected first the man who had a motive, a man who had himself declared he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had such motives, who had made no secret of it; they would, in fact, have suspected the son of the murdered man, Dmitri Fyodorovitch.
<p/>But how do you explain this? but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) knew of its existence in the house. Had Smerdyakov killed and robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), and the son been accused of it, that would, of course, have suited Smerdyakov.
<p/>Yet are we to believe that, though plotting the murder, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) told that son, Dmitri, about the money, the envelope, and the signals?
<p/>When the day of the murder planned by Smerdyakov came, we have him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) falling downstairs in a feigned fit--with what object?
<p/>In the first place that Grigory, who had been intending to take his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) medicine, might put it off and remain on guard, seeing there was no one to look after the house, and, in the second place, I suppose, that his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) master seeing that there was no one to guard him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), and in terror of a visit from his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) son, might redouble his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) vigilance and precaution.
<p/>And, most of all, I suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), Smerdyakov, disabled by the fit, might be carried from the kitchen, where he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) always slept, apart from all the rest, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) could go in and out as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) liked, to Grigory's room at the other end of the lodge, where he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was always put, shut off by a screen three paces from their own bed.
<p/>Is that logical? Is that clear? '' This was the immemorial custom established by his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) master and the kind-hearted Marfa Ignatyevna, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had a fit.
<p/>There, lying behind the screen, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would most likely, to keep up the sham, have begun groaning, and so keeping them awake all night -LRB-as Grigory and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wife testified-RRB-.
<p/>But I shall be told that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) shammed illness on purpose that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might not be suspected and that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) told the prisoner of the money and the signals to tempt him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to commit the murder, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and had gone away with the money, making a noise, most likely, and waking people, Smerdyakov got up, am I to believe, and went in--what for?
<p/>And all this, we are to believe, that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) might more conveniently get up and murder his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) master! '' To murder his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) master a second time and carry off the money that had already been stolen?
<p/>Gentlemen, are you laughing? I am ashamed to put forward such suggestions, but, incredible as it seems, that's just what the prisoner alleges.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had left the house, had knocked Grigory down and raised an alarm, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) tells us Smerdyakov got up, went in and murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) master and stole the money!
<p/>I won't press the point that Smerdyakov could hardly have reckoned on this beforehand, and have foreseen that the furious and exasperated son would simply come to peep in respectfully, though he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) knew the signals, and beat a retreat, leaving Smerdyakov his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) booty.
<p/>Gentlemen of the jury, I put this question to you in earnest; when was the moment when Smerdyakov could have committed his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) crime?
<p/>Name that moment, or you can't accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). '' But, perhaps, the fit was a real one, the sick man suddenly recovered, heard a shout, and went out.
<p/>Well--what then? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and said, `Why not go and kill the master?' And how did he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) know what had happened, since he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had been lying unconscious till that moment?
<p/>But there's a limit to these flights of fancy. '' ' Quite so,' some astute people will tell me, `but what if they were in agreement?
<p/>What if they murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) together and shared the money--what then?' A weighty question, truly! And the facts to confirm it are astounding.
<p/>One commits the murder and takes all the trouble while his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) accomplice lies on one side shamming a fit, apparently to arouse suspicion in every one, alarm in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) master and alarm in Grigory.
<p/>It would be interesting to know what motives could have induced the two accomplices to form such an insane plan. ''
<p/>But perhaps it was not a case of active complicity on Smerdyakov's part, but only of passive acquiescence; perhaps Smerdyakov was intimidated and agreed not to prevent the murder, and foreseeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would be blamed for letting his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) master be murdered, without screaming for help or resisting, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) may have obtained permission from Dmitri Karamazov to get out of the way by shamming a fit--`you may murder him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) as you like; it's nothing to me.'
<p/>But as this attack of Smerdyakov's was bound to throw the household into confusion, Dmitri Karamazov could never have agreed to such a plan.
<p/>Supposing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) did agree, it would still follow that Dmitri Karamazov is the murderer and the instigator, and Smerdyakov is only a passive accomplice, and not even an accomplice, but merely acquiesced against his (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) will through terror.
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) is arrested the prisoner instantly throws all the blame on Smerdyakov, not accusing him (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) of being his (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) accomplice, but of being himself the murderer. '
<p/>I will waive that point however. '' But what do we see? He (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) did it alone,' he (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) says. ' He (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) murdered and robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>).
<p/>It was the work of his (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) hands.' Strange sort of accomplices who begin to accuse one another at once! And think of the risk for Karamazov.
<p/>After committing the murder while his (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) accomplice lay in bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) throws the blame on the invalid, who might well have resented it and in self-preservation might well have confessed the truth.
<p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) might well have seen that the court would at once judge how far he (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) was responsible, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) might well have reckoned that if he (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) were punished, it would be far less severely than the real murderer.
<p/>Smerdyakov never hinted at their complicity, though the actual murderer persisted in accusing him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) and declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) had committed the crime alone.
<p/>What's more, Smerdyakov at the inquiry volunteered the statement that it was he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) who had told the prisoner of the envelope of notes and of the signals, and that, but for him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) would have known nothing about them.
<p/>But in that case he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) would have been certain to make a confession, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) has not done so. '' If he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) had really been a guilty accomplice, would he (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) so readily have made this statement at the inquiry?
<p/>On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) would have tried to conceal it, to distort the facts or minimize them. But he (<font color='blue'><b>accomplice</b></font>) was far from distorting or minimizing them.
<p/>No one but an innocent man, who had no fear of being charged with complicity, could have acted as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left a note written in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) peculiar language, 'I destroy myself of my own will and inclination so as to throw no blame on any one.'
<p/>And in a fit of melancholy arising from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) disease and this catastrophe he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hanged himself yesterday. What would it have cost him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to add: 'I am the murderer, not Karamazov'?
<p/>But that he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) did not add. Did his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) conscience lead him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) to suicide and not to avowing his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) guilt? '' And what followed?
<p/>Notes for three thousand roubles were brought into the court just now, and we were told that they were the same that lay in the envelope now on the table before us, and that the witness had received them from Smerdyakov the day before.
<p/>But I need not recall the painful scene, though I will make one or two comments, selecting such trivial ones as might not be obvious at first sight to every one, and so may be overlooked.
<p/>In the first place, Smerdyakov must have given back the money and hanged himself yesterday from remorse. And only yesterday he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) confessed his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) guilt to Ivan Karamazov, as the latter informs us.
<p/>And so, if he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) has confessed, then why, I ask again, did he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) not avow the whole truth in the last letter he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) left behind, knowing that the innocent prisoner had to face this terrible ordeal the next day?
<p/>If it were not so, indeed, why should Ivan Fyodorovitch have kept silence till now? '' The money alone is no proof.
<p/>A week ago, quite by chance, the fact came to the knowledge of myself and two other persons in this court that Ivan Fyodorovitch had sent two five per cent.
<p/>I only mention this to point out that any one may have money, and that it can't be proved that these notes are the same as were in Fyodor Pavlovitch's envelope.
<p/>coupons of five thousand each--that is, ten thousand in all--to the chief town of the province to be changed. '' Ivan Karamazov, after receiving yesterday a communication of such importance from the real murderer, did not stir.
<p/>Why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) report it at once? Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) put it all off till morning? I think I have a right to conjecture why.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) health had been giving way for a week past: he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) had admitted to a doctor and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) most intimate friends that he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) was suffering from hallucinations and seeing phantoms of the dead: he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) was on the eve of the attack of brain fever by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) has been stricken down to-day.
<p/>In this condition he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) suddenly heard of Smerdyakov's death, and at once reflected, `The man is dead, I can throw the blame on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and save my brother.
<p/>I have money. I will take a roll of notes and say that Smerdyakov gave them me before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) death.' You will say that was dishonorable: it's dishonorable to slander even the dead, and even to save a brother.
<p/>True, but what if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) slandered him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) unconsciously? What if, finally unhinged by the sudden news of the valet's death, he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) imagined it really was so?
<p/>You saw the recent scene: you have seen the witness's condition. He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was standing up and was speaking, but where was his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) mind?
<p/>Then followed the document, the prisoner's letter written two days before the crime, and containing a complete program of the murder.
<p/>'' Why, then, are we looking for any other program? The crime was committed precisely according to this program, and by no other than the writer of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) did not run respectfully and timidly away from his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) father's window, though he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) was firmly convinced that the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) affections was with him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>).
<p/>Yes, gentlemen of the jury, it went off without a hitch! No, that is absurd and unlikely! He (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) went in and murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>).
<p/>But having killed him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>), probably with one blow of the brass pestle, and having convinced himself, after careful search, that she (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) was not there, he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) did not, however, forget to put his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) hand under the pillow and take out the envelope, the torn cover of which lies now on the table before us.
<p/>Most likely he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) killed him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) in anger, burning with resentment, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) looked on his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) hated rival. '' I mention this fact that you may note one, to my thinking, very characteristic circumstance.
<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) been an experienced murderer and had he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) committed the murder for the sake of gain only, would he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) have left the torn envelope on the floor as it was found, beside the corpse?
<p/>Had it been Smerdyakov, for instance, murdering his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) master to rob him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) would have simply carried away the envelope with him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>), without troubling himself to open it over his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) victim's corpse, for he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) would have known for certain that the notes were in the envelope--they had been put in and sealed up in his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) presence--and had he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) taken the envelope with him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>), no one would ever have known of the robbery.
<p/>I ask you, gentlemen, would Smerdyakov have behaved in that way? Would he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) have left the envelope on the floor? ''
<p/>No, this was the action of a frantic murderer, a murderer who was not a thief and had never stolen before that day, who snatched the notes from under the pillow, not like a thief stealing them, but as though seizing his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) own property from the thief who had stolen it.
<p/>And pouncing upon the envelope, which he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) had never seen before, he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) tore it open to make sure whether the money was in it, and ran away with the money in his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) pocket, even forgetting to consider that he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) had left an astounding piece of evidence against himself in that torn envelope on the floor.
<p/>For that was the idea which had become almost an insane obsession in Dmitri Karamazov in regard to that money. All because it was Karamazov, not Smerdyakov, he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) didn't think, he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) didn't reflect, and how should he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>)?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) ran away; he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) heard behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) the servant cry out; the old man caught him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and was felled to the ground by the brass pestle.
<p/>Would you believe it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tells us that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leapt down out of pity, out of compassion, to see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could do anything for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' The prisoner, moved by pity, leapt down to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>). Was that a moment to show compassion? No; he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) jumped down simply to make certain whether the only witness of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) crime were dead or alive.
<p/>Note that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) took trouble over Grigory, wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) head with his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) handkerchief and, convincing himself he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) ran to the house of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) mistress, dazed and covered with blood.
<p/>Any other feeling, any other motive would be unnatural. How was it he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) never thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was covered with blood and would be at once detected?
<p/>But the prisoner himself assures us that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) did not even notice that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was covered with blood. That may be believed, that is very possible, that always happens at such moments with criminals.
<p/>On one point they will show diabolical cunning, while another will escape them altogether. But he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was thinking at that moment of one thing only--where was she (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) ?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) wanted to find out at once where she (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was, so he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) lodging and learnt an unexpected and astounding piece of news--she (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had gone off to Mokroe to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) first lover.
<p/>Ippolit Kirillovitch had chosen the historical method of exposition, beloved by all nervous orators, who find in its limitation a check on their own eager rhetoric.
<p/>At this moment in his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) speech he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) went off into a dissertation on Grushenka's <div class="bookquote">``first lover,''  (<font color='red'><b>Grushenka</b></font>)</div>and brought forward several interesting thoughts on this theme.
<p/>Karamazov, who had been frantically jealous of every one, collapsed, so to speak, and effaced himself at once before this first lover.
<p/>'' Chapter IX. The Galloping Troika. The End Of The Prosecutor's Speech. '' What makes it all the more strange is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) seems to have hardly thought of this formidable rival.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) had looked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) as a remote danger, and Karamazov always lives in the present. Possibly he (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) as a fiction.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) wounded heart grasped instantly that the woman had been concealing this new rival and deceiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) was anything but a fiction to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) was the one hope of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life.
<p/>Grasping this instantly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) resigned himself. '' Gentlemen of the jury, I cannot help dwelling on this unexpected trait in the prisoner's character.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) suddenly evinces an irresistible desire for justice, a respect for woman and a recognition of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) right to love. And all this at the very moment when he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had stained his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) hands with his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) father's blood for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sake!
<p/>It is true that the blood he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had shed was already crying out for vengeance, for, after having ruined his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) soul and his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) life in this world, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was forced to ask himself at that same instant what he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was and what he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) could be now to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), to that being, dearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) than his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) own soul, in comparison with that former lover who had returned penitent, with new love, to the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had once betrayed, with honorable offers, with the promise of a reformed and happy life.
<p/>Karamazov felt all this, knew that all ways were barred to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) crime and that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was a criminal under sentence, and not a man with life before him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)!
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) instantly flew to one frantic plan, which, to a man of Karamazov's character, must have appeared the one inevitable way out of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) terrible position.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), luckless man, what could he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now, what could he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) offer her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? '' This thought crushed him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). That way out was suicide.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) ran for the pistols he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had left in pledge with his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) friend Perhotin and on the way, as he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) ran, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) pulled out of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) pocket the money, for the sake of which he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had stained his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) hands with his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) father's gore.
<p/>Oh, now he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) needed money more than ever. Karamazov would die, Karamazov would shoot himself and it should be remembered! To be sure, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was a poet and had burnt the candle at both ends all his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) life. '
<p/>and there, oh, there I will give a feast to the whole world, such as never was before, that will be remembered and talked of long after!
<p/>In the midst of shouts of wild merriment, reckless gypsy songs and dances I shall raise the glass and drink to the woman I adore and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) new-found happiness!
<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)! And then, on the spot, at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet, I shall dash out my brains before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and punish myself!
<p/>Here we see in excess a love of effect, a romantic despair and sentimentality, and the wild recklessness of the Karamazovs.
<p/>Yes, but there is something else, gentlemen of the jury, something that cries out in the soul, throbs incessantly in the mind, and poisons the heart unto death--that something is conscience, gentlemen of the jury, its judgment, its terrible torments!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will remember Mitya Karamazov sometimes, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will see how Mitya loved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will feel for Mitya!' '' The pistol will settle everything, the pistol is the only way out!
<p/>But beyond --I don't know whether Karamazov wondered at that moment `What lies beyond,' and whether Karamazov could, like Hamlet, wonder `What lies beyond.'
<p/>No, gentlemen of the jury, they have their Hamlets, but we still have our Karamazovs! '' Here Ippolit Kirillovitch drew a minute picture of Mitya's preparations, the scene at Perhotin's, at the shop, with the drivers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) quoted numerous words and actions, confirmed by witnesses, and the picture made a terrible impression on the audience. The guilt of this harassed and desperate man stood out clear and convincing, when the facts were brought together.
<p/>'' What need had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of precaution? Two or three times he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) almost confessed, hinted at it, all but spoke out.
<p/>'' -LRB-Then followed the evidence given by witnesses.-RRB- '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even cried out to the peasant who drove him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), `Do you know, you are driving a murderer!'
<p/>But it was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) to speak out, he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) had to get to Mokroe and there to finish his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) romance.
<p/>Almost from the first minute at Mokroe he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) invincible rival was perhaps by no means so invincible, that the toast to their new-found happiness was not desired and would not be acceptable.
<p/>Karamazov's triumph over his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) rival was complete and his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) soul passed into quite a new phase, perhaps the most terrible phase through which his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) soul has passed or will pass.
<p/>But what was awaiting the luckless man? But you know the facts, gentlemen of the jury, from the preliminary inquiry. ''
<p/>One may say with certainty, gentlemen of the jury,'' the prosecutor continued, <div class="bookquote">``that outraged nature and the criminal heart bring their own vengeance more completely than any earthly justice.
<p/>What's more, justice and punishment on earth positively alleviate the punishment of nature and are, indeed, essential to the soul of the criminal at such moments, as its salvation from despair.
<p/>For I cannot imagine the horror and moral suffering of Karamazov when he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) learnt that she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>), that for his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) sake she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had rejected her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) first lover, that she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was summoning him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>), Mitya, to a new life, that she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was promising him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) happiness--and when?
<p/>By the way, I will note in parenthesis a point of importance for the light it throws on the prisoner's position at the moment.
<p/>This woman, this love of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), had been till the last moment, till the very instant of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) arrest, a being unattainable, passionately desired by him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) but unattainable.
<p/>Yet why did he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) not shoot himself then, why did he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) relinquish his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) design and even forget where his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) pistol was?
<p/>When everything was over for him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) and nothing was possible! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the prosecutor</b></font>)</div>It was just that passionate desire for love and the hope of satisfying it that restrained him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
<p/>Throughout their revels he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) kept close to his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) adored mistress, who was at the banquet with him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) and was more charming and fascinating to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) than ever--he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) did not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) side, abasing himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) homage before her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).
<p/>'' His (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) passion might well, for a moment, stifle not only the fear of arrest, but even the torments of conscience.
<p/>I can picture the state of mind of the criminal hopelessly enslaved by these influences--first, the influence of drink, of noise and excitement, of the thud of the dance and the scream of the song, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), flushed with wine, singing and dancing and laughing to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)!
<p/>Secondly, the hope in the background that the fatal end might still be far off, that not till next morning, at least, they would come and take him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
<p/>For a moment, oh, only for a moment! So he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had a few hours and that's much, very much! In a few hours one can think of many things.
<p/>I imagine that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) felt something like what criminals feel when they are being taken to the scaffold. They have another long, long street to pass down and at walking pace, past thousands of people.
<p/>Then there will be a turning into another street and only at the end of that street the dread place of execution!
<p/>I fancy that at the beginning of the journey the condemned man, sitting on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shameful cart, must feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has infinite life still before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>oh, that's nothing, it's still far to the turning into the second street and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still looks boldly to right and to left at those thousands of callously curious people with their eyes fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still fancies that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is just such a man as they.
<p/>Oh, that's nothing, nothing, there's still a whole street before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and however many houses have been passed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will still think there are many left.
<p/>The houses recede, the cart moves on-- But now the turning comes to the next street. And so to the very end, to the very scaffold.
<p/>'' This I imagine is how it was with Karamazov then. ' They've not had time yet,' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have thought, 'I may still find some way out,
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul was full of confusion and dread, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) managed, however, to put aside half his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money and hide it somewhere--I cannot otherwise explain the disappearance of quite half of the three thousand he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had just taken from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's pillow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been in Mokroe more than once before, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had caroused there for two days together already, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew the old big house with all its passages and outbuildings.
<p/>I imagine that part of the money was hidden in that house, not long before the arrest, in some crevice, under some floor, in some corner, under the roof.
<p/>oh, there's still time to make some plan of defense, and now, now--she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is so fascinating!' '' With what object? I shall be asked.
<p/>Why, the catastrophe may take place at once, of course; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hadn't yet considered how to meet it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hadn't the time, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head was throbbing and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart was with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) , but money--money was indispensable in any case!
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) assures us himself that a month before, at a critical and exciting moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had halved his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money and sewn it up in a little bag.
<p/>And though that was not true, as we shall prove directly, it shows the idea was a familiar one to Karamazov, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had contemplated it.
<p/>What's more, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) declared at the inquiry that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had put fifteen hundred roubles in a bag -LRB-which never existed-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may have invented that little bag on the inspiration of the moment, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had two hours before divided his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money and hidden half of it at Mokroe till morning, in case of emergency, simply not to have it on himself.
<p/>With money a man is always a man. Perhaps such foresight at such a moment may strike you as unnatural? Two extremes, gentlemen of the jury, remember that Karamazov can contemplate two extremes and both at once.
<p/>'' We have looked in the house, but we haven't found the money. It may still be there or it may have disappeared next day and be in the prisoner's hands now.
<p/>In any case he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was at her (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) side, on his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) knees before her (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) was lying on the bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hands stretched out to her (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had so entirely forgotten everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) did not even hear the men coming to arrest him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hadn't time to prepare any line of defense in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was caught unawares and confronted with his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) judges, the arbiters of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) destiny.
<p/>Gentlemen of the jury, there are moments in the execution of our duties when it is terrible for us to face a man, terrible on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) account, too!
<p/>The moments of contemplating that animal fear, when the criminal sees that all is lost, but still struggles, still means to struggle, the moments when every instinct of self-preservation rises up in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at once and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looks at you with questioning and suffering eyes, studies you, your face, your thoughts, uncertain on which side you will strike, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) distracted mind frames thousands of plans in an instant, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is still afraid to speak, afraid of giving himself away!
<p/>This purgatory of the spirit, this animal thirst for self-preservation, these humiliating moments of the human soul, are awful, and sometimes arouse horror and compassion for the criminal even in the lawyer.
<p/>'' And this was what we all witnessed then. '' At first he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was thunderstruck and in his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) terror dropped some very compromising phrases. '
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had not prepared what he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was to say, what answer he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was to make, he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had nothing but a bare denial ready. '
<p/>Blood! I've deserved it!' But he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) quickly restrained himself. I am not guilty of my father's death.' That was his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) fence for the moment and behind it
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) first compromising exclamations he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) hastened to explain by declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was responsible for the death of the servant Grigory only. '
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) hoped to throw up a barricade of some sort. Of that bloodshed I am guilty, but who has killed my father, gentlemen, who has killed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?
<p/>Who can have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), if not I ?' Do you hear, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked us that, us, who had come to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that question!
<p/>Do you hear that phrase uttered with such premature haste--`if not I'--the animal cunning, the naďveté, the Karamazov impatience of it? '
<p/>I wanted to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), gentlemen, I wanted to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>),' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hastens to admit -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was in a hurry, in a terrible hurry-RRB-, `but still I am not guilty
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) concedes to us that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wanted to murder him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), as though to say, you can see for yourselves how truthful I am, so you'll believe all the sooner that I didn't murder him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>I didn't kill him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and you mustn't think I did! , it is not I murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).' Oh, in such cases the criminal is often amazingly shallow and credulous.
<p/>At that point one of the lawyers asked him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>), as it were incidentally, the most simple question, `Wasn't it Smerdyakov killed him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>)?'
<p/>Then, as we expected, he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) was horribly angry at our having anticipated him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) and caught him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) unawares, before he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) had time to pave the way to choose and snatch the moment when it would be most natural to bring in Smerdyakov's name.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) rushed at once to the other extreme, as he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) always does, and began to assure us that Smerdyakov could not have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>), was not capable of it.
<p/>But don't believe him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>), that was only his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) cunning; he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) didn't really give up the idea of Smerdyakov; on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) meant to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) forward again; for, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) had no one else to bring forward, but he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) would do that later, because for the moment that line was spoiled for him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) would bring him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) forward perhaps next day, or even a few days later, choosing an opportunity to cry out to us, `You know I was more skeptical about Smerdyakov than you, you remember that yourselves, but now I am convinced.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) killed him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) must have done!' And for the present he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) falls back upon a gloomy and irritable denial.
<p/>Impatience and anger prompted him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>), however, to the most inept and incredible explanation of how he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) father's window and how he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) respectfully withdrew.
<p/>The worst of it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) was unaware of the position of affairs, of the evidence given by Grigory. ''
<p/>We proceeded to search him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>). The search angered, but encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>), the whole three thousand had not been found on him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>), only half of it.
<p/>No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) was conscious himself of the improbability of the story and strove painfully to make it sound more likely, to weave it into a romance that would sound plausible.
<p/>In such cases the first duty, the chief task of the investigating lawyers, is to prevent the criminal being prepared, to pounce upon him (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) unexpectedly so that he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) may blurt out his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) cherished ideas in all their simplicity, improbability and inconsistency.
<p/>The criminal can only be made to speak by the sudden and apparently incidental communication of some new fact, of some circumstance of great importance in the case, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) had no previous idea and could not have foreseen.
<p/>We had such a fact in readiness--that was Grigory's evidence about the open door through which the prisoner had run out.
<p/>And no doubt only at that moment of angry silence, the fiction of the little bag first occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had completely forgotten about that door and had not even suspected that Grigory could have seen it.
<p/>'' The effect of it was amazing. He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) leapt up and shouted to us, `Then Smerdyakov murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), it was Smerdyakov!'
<p/>and so betrayed the basis of the defense he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was keeping back, and betrayed it in its most improbable shape, for Smerdyakov could only have committed the murder after he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had knocked Grigory down and run away.
<p/>When we told him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) that Grigory saw the door was open before he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) fell down, and had heard Smerdyakov behind the screen as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) bedroom--Karamazov was positively crushed.
<p/>My esteemed and witty colleague, Nikolay Parfenovitch, told me afterwards that he (<font color='blue'><b>colleague</b></font>) was almost moved to tears at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>colleague</b></font>).
<p/>And to improve matters, the prisoner hastened to tell us about the much-talked-of little bag-- so be it, you shall hear this romance!
<p/>Gentlemen of the jury, I have told you already why I consider this romance not only an absurdity, but the most improbable invention that could have been brought forward in the circumstances.
<p/>The worst of such stories is that the triumphant romancers can always be put to confusion and crushed by the very details in which real life is so rich and which these unhappy and involuntary story-tellers neglect as insignificant trifles.
<p/>'' If one tried for a bet to invent the most unlikely story, one could hardly find anything more incredible. Oh, they have no thought to spare for such details
<p/>, their minds are concentrated on their grand invention as a whole, and fancy any one daring to pull them up for a trifle!
<p/>The prisoner was asked the question, `Where did you get the stuff for your little bag and who made it for you?' 'I made it myself.' '
<p/>The prisoner was positively offended, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) thought it almost insulting to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) such a trivial question, and would you believe it, his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) resentment was genuine!
<p/>But that's how they are caught. And where did you get the linen?' But they are all like that. ' I tore it off my shirt.' '
<p/>And only fancy, gentlemen of the jury, if we really had found that torn shirt -LRB-and how could we have failed to find it in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) chest of drawers or trunk?-RRB- that would have been a fact, a material fact in support of his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) statement!
<p/>Then we shall find that shirt among your linen to-morrow, with a piece torn off.' But he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was incapable of that reflection. '
<p/>I don't remember, it may not have been off my shirt, I sewed it up in one of my landlady's caps.' '
<p/>What sort of a cap?' ' It was an old cotton rag of hers lying about.' ' And do you remember that clearly?'
<p/>At the most terrible moments of man's life, for instance when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is being led to execution, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembers just such trifles.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will forget anything but some green roof that has flashed past him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on the road, or a jackdaw on a cross--that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will remember.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) concealed the making of that little bag from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) household, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) humiliating fear that some one might come in and find him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needle in hand, how at the slightest sound he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slipped behind the screen -LRB-there is a screen in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lodgings-RRB-.
<p/>' No, I don't.' And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was angry, very angry, and yet imagine not remembering it! '' But, gentlemen of the jury, why do I tell you all this, all these details, trifles?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not explained anything since that fatal night two months ago, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not added one actual illuminating fact to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) former fantastic statements; all those are trivialities. '
<p/>'' cried Ippolit Kirillovitch suddenly. '' Just because the prisoner still persists in these absurdities to this moment. You must believe it on my honor.'
<p/>Oh, we are glad to believe it, we are eager to believe it, even if only on his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) word of honor!
<p/>Show us a single fact in the prisoner's favor and we shall rejoice; but let it be a substantial, real fact, and not a conclusion drawn from the prisoner's expression by his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) own brother, or that when he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) beat himself on the breast he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) must have meant to point to the little bag, in the darkness, too.
<p/>We shall rejoice at the new fact, we shall be the first to repudiate our charge, we shall hasten to repudiate it.
<p/>Are we jackals thirsting for human blood? But now justice cries out and we persist, we cannot repudiate anything. '' Ippolit Kirillovitch passed to his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) final peroration.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) looked as though he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was in a fever, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) spoke of the blood that cried for vengeance, the blood of the father murdered by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son, with the base motive of robbery!
<p/>And whatever you may hear from the talented and celebrated counsel for the defense,'' Ippolit Kirillovitch could not resist adding, <div class="bookquote">``whatever eloquent and touching appeals may be made to your sensibilities, remember that at this moment you are in a temple of justice.
<p/>Remember that you are the champions of our justice, the champions of our holy Russia, of her (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) principles, her (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) family, everything that she (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) holds sacred!
<p/>Yes, you represent Russia here at this moment, and your verdict will be heard not in this hall only but will reëcho throughout the whole of Russia, and all Russia will hear you, as her (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) champions and her (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) judges, and she (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will be encouraged or disheartened by your verdict.
<p/>Our fatal troika dashes on in her (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) headlong flight perhaps to destruction and in all Russia for long past men have stretched out imploring hands and called a halt to its furious reckless course.
<p/>And if other nations stand aside from that troika that may be, not from respect, as the poet would fain believe, but simply from horror.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) pointed to the tragic and glaring consistency of the facts. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ippolit Kirillovitch/Ippolit</b></font>)</div>Do not disappoint Russia and her (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) expectations. From horror, perhaps from disgust.
<p/>And well it is that they stand aside, but maybe they will cease one day to do so and will form a firm wall confronting the hurrying apparition and will check the frenzied rush of our lawlessness, for the sake of their own safety, enlightenment and civilization.
<p/>Already we have heard voices of alarm from Europe, they already begin to sound. Do not tempt them! Do not heap up their growing hatred by a sentence justifying the murder of a father by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) son!''
<p/>Though Ippolit Kirillovitch was genuinely moved, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wound up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) speech with this rhetorical appeal--and the effect produced by him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was extraordinary.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) speech, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went out hurriedly and, as I have mentioned before, almost fainted in the adjoining room.
<p/>The ladies were not so well satisfied, though even they were pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eloquence, especially as they had no apprehensions as to the upshot of the trial and had full trust in Fetyukovitch.
<p/>There was no applause in the court, but serious persons were pleased. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will speak at last and of course carry all before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>Every one looked at Mitya; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sat silent through the whole of the prosecutor's speech, clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) teeth, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands clasped, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head bowed.
<p/>When the prosecutor mentioned Rakitin's opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>), a smile of contempt and anger passed over his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) murmured rather audibly, <div class="bookquote">``The Bernards!
<p/>When Ippolit Kirillovitch described how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had questioned and tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) at Mokroe, Mitya raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head and listened with intense curiosity.
<p/>At one point he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seemed about to jump up and cry out, but controlled himself and only shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) shoulders disdainfully.
<p/>People talked afterwards of the end of the speech, of the prosecutor's feat in examining the prisoner at Mokroe, and jeered at Ippolit Kirillovitch.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Only from time to time he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) head and listened, especially when Grushenka was spoken of. '' '' The man could not resist boasting of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cleverness,'' they said.
<p/>The court was adjourned, but only for a short interval, a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes at most. There was a hum of conversation and exclamations in the audience.
<p/>I remember some of them. '' A weighty speech,'' a gentleman in one group observed gravely. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) brought in too much psychology,'' said another voice.
<p/>'' But it was all true, the absolute truth!'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is first rate at it.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) summed it all up.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) summed us up, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>chimed in another voice. '' Do you remember, at the beginning of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) speech, making out we were all like Fyodor Pavlovitch?''
<p/>'' And at the end, too. But that was all rot.'' '' And obscure too.'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was a little too much carried away.''
<p/>'' It's unjust, it's unjust.'' '' No, it was smartly done, anyway. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>)'s had long to wait, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>)'s had his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) say, ha ha!''
<p/>In another group I heard: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had no business to make a thrust at the Petersburg man like that; `appealing to your sensibilities'--do you remember?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What will the counsel for the defense say?

<p/>Fetyukovitch mounted the tribune. Chapter X. The Speech For The Defense. An Argument That Cuts Both Ways All was hushed as the first words of the famous orator rang out.
<p/>The eyes of the audience were fastened upon him (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) began very simply and directly, with an air of conviction, but not the slightest trace of conceit.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) made no attempt at eloquence, at pathos, or emotional phrases. He (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) was like a man speaking in a circle of intimate and sympathetic friends.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) voice was a fine one, sonorous and sympathetic, and there was something genuine and simple in the very sound of it.
<p/>But every one realized at once that the speaker might suddenly rise to genuine pathos and <div class="bookquote">``pierce the heart with untold power.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) language was perhaps more irregular than Ippolit Kirillovitch's, but he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) spoke without long phrases, and indeed, with more precision.
<p/>One thing did not please the ladies: he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) kept bending forward, especially at the beginning of his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) speech, not exactly bowing, but as though he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) were about to dart at his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) listeners, bending his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) long spine in half, as though there were a spring in the middle that enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) to bend almost at right angles.
<p/>At the beginning of his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) speech he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) spoke rather disconnectedly, without system, one may say, dealing with facts separately, though, at the end, these facts formed a whole.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) speech might be divided into two parts, the first consisting of criticism in refutation of the charge, sometimes malicious and sarcastic.
<p/>But in the second half he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) suddenly changed his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) tone, and even his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) manner, and at once rose to pathos. The audience seemed on the look-out for it, and quivered with enthusiasm.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) went straight to the point, and began by saying that although he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) practiced in Petersburg, he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had more than once visited provincial towns to defend prisoners, of whose innocence he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had a conviction or at least a preconceived idea.
<p/>From the very first accounts in the newspapers I was struck by something which strongly prepossessed me in the prisoner's favor.
<p/>What interested me most was a fact which often occurs in legal practice, but rarely, I think, in such an extreme and peculiar form as in the present case.
<p/>I ought to formulate that peculiarity only at the end of my speech, but I will do so at the very beginning, for it is my weakness to go to work directly, not keeping my effects in reserve and economizing my material.
<p/>'' That is what has happened to me in the present case,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) explained. '' That may be imprudent on my part, but at least it's sincere.
<p/>What I have in my mind is this: there is an overwhelming chain of evidence against the prisoner, and at the same time not one fact that will stand criticism, if it is examined separately.
<p/>As I followed the case more closely in the papers my idea was more and more confirmed, and I suddenly received from the prisoner's relatives a request to undertake his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) defense.
<p/>It was to break down this terrible chain of facts, and to show that each piece of evidence taken separately was unproved and fantastic, that I undertook the case.
<p/>I at once hurried here, and here I became completely convinced. '' So Fetyukovitch began. '' Gentlemen of the jury,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) suddenly protested, <div class="bookquote">``I am new to this district.
<p/>I have no preconceived ideas. The prisoner, a man of turbulent and unbridled temper, has not insulted me. But he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) has insulted perhaps hundreds of persons in this town, and so prejudiced many people against him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) beforehand.
<p/>Of course I recognize that the moral sentiment of local society is justly excited against him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>). The prisoner is of turbulent and violent temper.
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was received in society here; he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was even welcome in the family of my talented friend, the prosecutor. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>All of us knew that the prosecutor received Mitya against his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) will, solely because he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had somehow interested his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) wife--a lady of the highest virtue and moral worth, but fanciful, capricious, and fond of opposing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband, especially in trifles.
<p/>-LRB-N.B.. At these words there were two or three laughs in the audience, quickly suppressed, but noticed by all. Mitya's visits, however, had not been frequent.-RRB-
<p/>Nevertheless I venture to suggest,'' Fetyukovitch continued, <div class="bookquote">``that in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) independent mind and just character, my opponent may have formed a mistaken prejudice against my unfortunate client.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Fetyukovitch</b></font>)</div>Oh, that is so natural; the unfortunate man has only too well deserved such prejudice. Outraged morality, and still more outraged taste, is often relentless.
<p/>We have, in the talented prosecutor's speech, heard a stern analysis of the prisoner's character and conduct, and his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) severe critical attitude to the case was evident.
<p/>And, what's more, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) went into psychological subtleties into which he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) could not have entered, if he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had the least conscious and malicious prejudice against the prisoner.
<p/>But there are things which are even worse, even more fatal in such cases, than the most malicious and consciously unfair attitude.
<p/>It is worse if we are carried away by the artistic instinct, by the desire to create, so to speak, a romance, especially if God has endowed us with psychological insight.
<p/>Before I started on my way here, I was warned in Petersburg, and was myself aware, that I should find here a talented opponent whose psychological insight and subtlety had gained him (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) peculiar renown in legal circles of recent years.
<p/>But profound as psychology is, it's a knife that cuts both ways. '' -LRB-Laughter among the public.-RRB- '' You will, of course, forgive me my comparison; I can't boast of eloquence.
<p/>The prisoner, running away in the garden in the dark, climbed over the fence, was seized by the servant, and knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) down with a brass pestle.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) jumped back into the garden and spent five minutes over the man, trying to discover whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had killed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) or not.
<p/>But I will take as an example any point in the prosecutor's speech. '' And the prosecutor refuses to believe the prisoner's statement that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) ran to old Grigory out of pity. '
<p/>No,' he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) says, `such sensibility is impossible at such a moment, that's unnatural; he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) ran to find out whether the only witness of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) crime was dead or alive, and so showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had committed the murder, since he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) would not have run back for any other reason.'
<p/>Here you have psychology; but let us take the same method and apply it to the case the other way round, and our result will be no less probable.
<p/>The murderer, we are told, leapt down to find out, as a precaution, whether the witness was alive or not, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had left in his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) murdered father's study, as the prosecutor himself argues, an amazing piece of evidence in the shape of a torn envelope, with an inscription that there had been three thousand roubles in it. '
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had carried that envelope away with him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>), no one in the world would have known of that envelope and of the notes in it, and that the money had been stolen by the prisoner.'
<p/>So on one side you see a complete absence of precaution, a man who has lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head and run away in a fright, leaving that clew on the floor, and two minutes later, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has killed another man, we are entitled to assume the most heartless and calculating foresight in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>But even admitting this was so, it is psychological subtlety, I suppose, that discerns that under certain circumstances I become as bloodthirsty and keen-sighted as a Caucasian eagle, while at the next I am as timid and blind as a mole.
<p/>But if I am so bloodthirsty and cruelly calculating that when I kill a man I only run back to find out whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is alive to witness against me, why should I spend five minutes looking after my victim at the risk of encountering other witnesses?
<p/>'' Those are the prosecutor's own words. Why soak my handkerchief, wiping the blood off his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) head so that it may be evidence against me later?
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) were so cold-hearted and calculating, why not hit the servant on the head again and again with the same pestle so as to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) outright and relieve himself of all anxiety about the witness?
<p/>Again, though he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) ran to see whether the witness was alive, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) left another witness on the path, that brass pestle which he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had taken from the two women, and which they could always recognize afterwards as theirs, and prove that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had taken it from them.
<p/>as though he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had forgotten it on the path, dropped it through carelessness or haste, no, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had flung away his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) weapon, for it was found fifteen paces from where Grigory lay.
<p/>Just because he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was grieved at having killed a man, an old servant; and he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) flung away the pestle with a curse, as a murderous weapon.
<p/>'' And it is not Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) do so? That's how it must have been, what other reason could he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) have had for throwing it so far?
<p/>And if he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was capable of feeling grief and pity at having killed a man, it shows that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was innocent of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's murder.
<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would never have run to another victim out of pity; then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have felt differently; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts would have been centered on self-preservation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have had none to spare for pity, that is beyond doubt. On the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have broken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) skull instead of spending five minutes looking after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>There was room for pity and good-feeling just because his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conscience had been clear till then. Here we have a different psychology.
<p/>I have purposely resorted to this method, gentlemen of the jury, to show that you can prove anything by it. It all depends on who makes use of it.
<p/>Psychology lures even most serious people into romancing, and quite unconsciously. I am speaking of the abuse of psychology, gentlemen. ''
<p/>Sounds of approval and laughter, at the expense of the prosecutor, were again audible in the court. I will not repeat the speech in detail; I will only quote some passages from it, some leading points.
<p/>Chapter XI. There Was No Money. There Was No Robbery There was one point that struck every one in Fetyukovitch's speech.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) flatly denied the existence of the fatal three thousand roubles, and consequently, the possibility of their having been stolen. ''
<p/>Every new and unprejudiced observer must be struck by a characteristic peculiarity in the present case, namely, the charge of robbery, and the complete impossibility of proving that there was anything to be stolen.
<p/>Gentlemen of the jury,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) began. '' We are told that money was stolen--three thousand roubles--but whether those roubles ever existed, nobody knows.
<p/>Consider, how have we heard of that sum, and who has seen the notes? The only person who saw them, and stated that they had been put in the envelope, was the servant, Smerdyakov.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had spoken of it to the prisoner and his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) brother, Ivan Fyodorovitch, before the catastrophe. Madame Svyetlov, too, had been told of it.
<p/>Here the question arises, if it's true that they did exist, and that Smerdyakov had seen them, when did he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) see them for the last time?
<p/>What if his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) master had taken the notes from under his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) bed and put them back in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) cash-box without telling him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)?
<p/>But not one of these three persons had actually seen the notes, no one but Smerdyakov had seen them. '' Note, that according to Smerdyakov's story the notes were kept under the mattress
<p/>; the prisoner must have pulled them out, and yet the bed was absolutely unrumpled; that is carefully recorded in the protocol.
<p/>How could the prisoner have found the notes without disturbing the bed? How could he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) have helped soiling with his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) blood-
<p/>stained hands the fine and spotless linen with which the bed had been purposely made? '' But I shall be asked: What about the envelope on the floor?
<p/>Yes, it's worth saying a word or two about that envelope. I was somewhat surprised just now to hear the highly talented prosecutor declare of himself--of himself, observe--that
<p/>but for that envelope, but for its being left on the floor, no one in the world would have known of the existence of that envelope and the notes in it, and therefore of the prisoner's having stolen it.
<p/>the sole proof on which the charge of robbery rests, `otherwise no one would have known of the robbery, nor perhaps even of the money.'
<p/>But is the mere fact that that scrap of paper was lying on the floor a proof that there was money in it, and that that money had been stolen?
<p/>And so that torn scrap of paper is, by the prosecutor's own admission, Yet, it will be objected, Smerdyakov had seen the money in the envelope.
<p/>But when, when had he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) seen it for the last time, I ask you that? I talked to Smerdyakov, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had seen the notes two days before the catastrophe.
<p/>Then why not imagine that old Fyodor Pavlovitch, locked up alone in impatient and hysterical expectation of the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) adoration, may have whiled away the time by breaking open the envelope and taking out the notes. '
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) won't believe the notes are there, but when I show her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) the thirty rainbow-colored notes in one roll, it will make more impression, you may be sure, it will make her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mouth water.'
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) tears open the envelope, takes out the money, and flings the envelope on the floor, conscious of being the owner and untroubled by any fears of leaving evidence.
<p/>What's the use of the envelope?' he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) may have asked himself. ' '' Listen, gentlemen, could anything be more likely than this theory and such an action?
<p/>But if anything of the sort could have taken place, the charge of robbery falls to the ground; if there was no money, there was no theft of it.
<p/>If the envelope on the floor may be taken as evidence that there had been money in it, why may I not maintain the opposite, that the envelope was on the floor because the money had been taken from it by its owner?
<p/>But I shall be asked what became of the money if Fyodor Pavlovitch took it out of the envelope since it was not found when the police searched the house?
<p/>In the first place, part of the money was found in the cash-box, and secondly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) might have taken it out that morning or the evening before to make some other use of it, to give or send it away; he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) may have changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) idea, his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) plan of action completely, without thinking it necessary to announce the fact to Smerdyakov beforehand.
<p/>And if there is the barest possibility of such an explanation, how can the prisoner be so positively accused of having committed murder for the sake of robbery, and of having actually carried out that robbery?
<p/>If it is maintained that something has been stolen, the thing must be produced, or at least its existence must be proved beyond doubt.
<p/>Why is it out of the question? '' This is encroaching on the domain of romance. Yet no one had ever seen these notes.
<p/>a young man of eighteen, hardly more than a boy, who carried on a small business as a costermonger, went in broad daylight into a moneychanger's shop with an ax, and with extraordinary, typical audacity killed the master of the shop and carried off fifteen hundred roubles.
<p/>Five hours later he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was arrested, and, except fifteen roubles he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had already managed to spend, the whole sum was found on him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).
<p/>Moreover, the shopman, on his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) return to the shop after the murder, informed the police not only of the exact sum stolen, but even of the notes and gold coins of which that sum was made up, and those very notes and coins were found on the criminal.
<p/>'' Not long ago in Petersburg This was followed by a full and genuine confession on the part of the murderer.
<p/>That's what I call evidence, gentlemen of the jury! In that case I know, I see, I touch the money, and cannot deny its existence.
<p/>Yes, I shall be told, but he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was carousing that night, squandering money; he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was shown to have had fifteen hundred roubles--where did he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) get the money?
<p/>But the very fact that only fifteen hundred could be found, and the other half of the sum could nowhere be discovered, shows that that money was not the same, and had never been in any envelope.
<p/>By strict calculation of time it was proved at the preliminary inquiry that the prisoner ran straight from those women servants to Perhotin's without going home, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had been nowhere.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had been all the time in company and therefore could not have divided the three thousand in half and hidden half in the town.
<p/>It's just this consideration that has led the prosecutor to assume that the money is hidden in some crevice at Mokroe.
<p/>Is it the same in the present case? And yet it is a question of life and death. '' Why not in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho, gentlemen?
<p/>And observe, if that supposition breaks down, the whole charge of robbery is scattered to the winds, for in that case what could have become of the other fifteen hundred roubles?
<p/>Isn't this supposition really too fantastic and too romantic? By what miracle could they have disappeared, since it's proved the prisoner went nowhere else?
<p/>I shall be told that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) could not explain where he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) got the fifteen hundred that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had, and every one knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was without money before that night.
<p/>The prisoner has made a clear and unflinching statement of the source of that money, and if you will have it so, gentlemen of the jury, nothing can be more probable than that statement, and more consistent with the temper and spirit of the prisoner.
<p/>And we are ready to ruin a man's life with such tales! '' Who knew it, pray? The prosecutor is charmed with his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) own romance.
<p/>A man of weak will, who had brought himself to take the three thousand so insultingly offered by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) betrothed, could not, we are told, have set aside half and sewn it up, but would, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done so, have unpicked it every two days and taken out a hundred, and so would have spent it all in a month.
<p/>All this, you will remember, was put forward in a tone that brooked no contradiction. But what if the thing happened quite differently?
<p/>What if you've been weaving a romance, and about quite a different kind of man? That's just it, you have invented quite a different man!
<p/>I shall be told, perhaps, there are witnesses that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spent on one day all that three thousand given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) betrothed a month before the catastrophe, so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not have divided the sum in half.
<p/>Besides, in another man's hand a crust always seems larger, and no one of these witnesses counted that money; they all judged simply at sight.
<p/>'' But who are these witnesses? The value of their evidence has been shown in court already. And the witness Maximov has testified that the prisoner had twenty thousand in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hand.
<p/>You see, gentlemen of the jury, psychology is a two- edged weapon. Let me turn the other edge now and see what comes of it.
<p/>A month before the catastrophe the prisoner was entrusted by Katerina Ivanovna with three thousand roubles to send off by post.
<p/>But the question is: is it true that they were entrusted to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) in such an insulting and degrading way as was proclaimed just now?
<p/>'' The first statement made by the young lady on the subject was different, perfectly different. In the second statement we heard only cries of resentment and revenge, cries of long-concealed hatred.
<p/>And the very fact that the witness gave her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) first evidence incorrectly, gives us a right to conclude that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) second piece of evidence may have been incorrect also.
<p/>I will not touch on it either, but will only venture to observe that if a lofty and high- principled person, such as that highly respected young lady unquestionably is, if such a person, I say, allows herself suddenly in court to contradict her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) first statement, with the obvious motive of ruining the prisoner, it is clear that this evidence has been given not impartially, not coolly.
<p/>The prosecutor will not, dare not -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) own words-RRB- touch on that story. So be it. Have not we the right to assume that a revengeful woman might have exaggerated much?
<p/>No, it was offered in such a way that it was possible to take it, especially for a man so easy-going as the prisoner, above all, as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) expected to receive shortly from his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) father the three thousand roubles that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) reckoned was owing to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
<p/>It was unreflecting of him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), but it was just his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) irresponsible want of reflection that made him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) so confident that his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) father would give him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) the money, that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would get it, and so could always dispatch the money entrusted to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) and repay the debt.
<p/>But the prosecutor refuses to allow that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) could the same day have set aside half the money and sewn it up in a little bag.
<p/>Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) may well have exaggerated, in particular, the insult and humiliation of her (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) offering him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) the money. '' That's not his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) character, he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) tells us, he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) couldn't have had such feelings.
<p/>But yet he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) talked himself of the broad Karamazov nature; he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) cried out about the two extremes which a Karamazov can contemplate at once.
<p/>Karamazov is just such a two-sided nature, fluctuating between two extremes, that even when moved by the most violent craving for riotous gayety, he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) can pull himself up, if something strikes him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) on the other side.
<p/>And on the other side is love--that new love which had flamed up in his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) heart, and for that love he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) needed money;
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) were to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>), 'I am yours, I won't have Fyodor Pavlovitch,' then he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) must have money to take her (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) away.
<p/>oh, far more than for carousing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) mistress. That was more important than carousing. Could a Karamazov fail to understand it?
<p/>That anxiety was just what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was suffering from--what is there improbable in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) laying aside that money and concealing it in case of emergency?
<p/>But time passed, and Fyodor Pavlovitch did not give the prisoner the expected three thousand; on the contrary, the latter heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) meant to use this sum to seduce the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>), the prisoner, loved. '
<p/>If Fyodor Pavlovitch doesn't give the money,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) thought, 'I shall be put in the position of a thief before Katerina Ivanovna.'
<p/>And then the idea presented itself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) would go to Katerina Ivanovna, lay before her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) the fifteen hundred roubles he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) still carried round his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) neck, and say, 'I am a scoundrel, but not a thief.'
<p/>So here we have already a twofold reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) should guard that sum of money as the apple of his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) eye, why he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) shouldn't unpick the little bag, and spend it a hundred at a time.
<p/>'' Why should you deny the prisoner a sense of honor? Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) has a sense of honor, granted that it's misplaced, granted
<p/>But now the affair becomes even more complex; his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) jealous torments reach a climax, and those same two questions torture his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) fevered brain more and more: `If I repay Katerina Ivanovna, where can I find the means to go off with Grushenka?'
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) behaved wildly, drank, and made disturbances in the taverns in the course of that month, it was perhaps because he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was wretched and strained beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) powers of endurance.
<p/>it's often mistaken, yet it exists and amounts to a passion, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) has proved that. '' These two questions became so acute that they drove him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) at last to despair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) sent his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) younger brother to beg for the last time for the three thousand roubles, but without waiting for a reply, burst in himself and ended by beating the old man in the presence of witnesses.
<p/>After that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no prospect of getting it from any one; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father would not give it him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) after that beating.
<p/>The same evening he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) struck himself on the breast, just on the upper part of the breast where the little bag was, and swore to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the means of not being a scoundrel, but that still he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would remain a scoundrel, for he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) foresaw that he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) would not use that means, that he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) wouldn't have the character, that he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) wouldn't have the will-power to do it.
<p/>Why, why does the prosecutor refuse to believe the evidence of Alexey Karamazov, given so genuinely and sincerely, so spontaneously and convincingly?
<p/>And why, on the contrary, does he (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) force me to believe in money hidden in a crevice, in the dungeons of the castle of Udolpho? ''
<p/>The same evening, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) talk with his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) brother, the prisoner wrote that fatal letter, and that letter is the chief, the most stupendous proof of the prisoner having committed robbery! '
<p/>I shall murder my father and shall take the envelope with the pink ribbon on it from under his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mattress as soon as Ivan has gone.'
<p/>'' I shall beg from every one, and if I don't get it A full program of the murder, we are told, so it must have been he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>). '
<p/>But in the first place, it's the letter of a drunken man and written in great irritation; secondly, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) writes of the envelope from what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has heard from Smerdyakov again, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not seen the envelope himself; and thirdly, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote it indeed, but how can you prove that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did it?
<p/>It has all been done as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote,' cries the prosecutor. '' Did the prisoner take the envelope from under the pillow, did he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) find the money, did that money exist indeed?
<p/>And was it to get money that the prisoner ran off, if you remember? He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) ran off post-haste not to steal, but to find out where she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, the woman who had crushed him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was not running to carry out a program, to carry out what he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had written, that is, not for an act of premeditated robbery, but he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) ran suddenly, spontaneously, in a jealous fury.
<p/>Yes! I shall be told, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) got there and murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) seized the money, too. But did he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) murder him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) after all?
<p/>The charge of robbery I repudiate with indignation. A man cannot be accused of robbery, if it's impossible to state accurately what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has stolen; that's an axiom.
<p/>But did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) murder him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) without robbery, did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) murder him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at all? Is that proved? Isn't that, too, a romance?''
<p/>Either ``Allow me, gentlemen of the jury, to remind you that a man's life is at stake and that you must be careful.
<p/>We have heard the prosecutor himself admit that until to-day he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) hesitated to accuse the prisoner of a full and conscious premeditation of the crime; he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) hesitated till he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) saw that fatal drunken letter which was produced in court to-day. '
<p/>Chapter XII. And There Was No Murder All was done as written.' But, I repeat again, he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was running to her (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), to seek her (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), solely to find out where she (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was.
<p/>Had she (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) been at home, he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) would not have run away, but would have remained at her (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) side, and so would not have done what he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) promised in the letter.
<p/>That's a fact that can't be disputed. He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) ran unexpectedly and accidentally, and by that time very likely he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) did not even remember his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) drunken letter. '
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) snatched up the pestle,' they say, and you will remember how a whole edifice of psychology was built on that pestle--why he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was bound to look at that pestle as a weapon, to snatch it up, and so on, and so on.
<p/>A very commonplace idea occurs to me at this point: What if that pestle had not been in sight, had not been lying on the shelf from which it was snatched by the prisoner, but had been put away in a cupboard?
<p/>It would not have caught the prisoner's eye, and he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would have run away without a weapon, with empty hands, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would certainly not have killed any one.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, but he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) talked in the taverns of murdering his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) father, and two days before, on the evening when he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) drunken letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was quiet and only quarreled with a shopman in the tavern, because a Karamazov could not help quarreling, forsooth!
<p/>But my answer to that is, that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was planning such a murder in accordance with his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) certainly would not have quarreled even with a shopman, and probably would not have gone into the tavern at all, because a person plotting such a crime seeks quiet and retirement, seeks to efface himself, to avoid being seen and heard, and that not from calculation, but from instinct.
<p/>How then can I look upon the pestle as a proof of premeditation? Gentlemen of the jury, the psychological method is a two-edged weapon, and we, too, can use it.
<p/>As for all this shouting in taverns throughout the month, don't we often hear children, or drunkards coming out of taverns shout, `I'll kill you'?
<p/>but they don't murder any one. And that fatal letter--isn't that simply drunken irritability, too? Isn't that simply the shout of the brawler outside the tavern, `I'll kill you!
<p/>I'll kill the lot of you!' Why not, why could it not be that? What reason have we to call that letter `fatal' rather than absurd?
<p/>Because his (<font color='blue'><b>brawler</b></font>) father has been found murdered, because a witness saw the prisoner running out of the garden with a weapon in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hand, and was knocked down by him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>): therefore, we are told, everything was done as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had planned in writing, and the letter was not `absurd,' but `fatal.'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>Now, thank God! we've come to the real point: `since he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was in the garden, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) must have murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).'
<p/>In those few words: `since he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was , then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) must ' lies the whole case for the prosecution. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was there, so he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) must have.
<p/>And what if there is no must about it, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was there? Oh, I admit that the chain of evidence--the coincidences--are really suggestive.
<p/>Why, for instance, does the prosecution refuse to admit the truth of the prisoner's statement that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) ran away from his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) father's window?
<p/>Remember the sarcasms in which the prosecutor indulged at the expense of the respectful and `pious' sentiments which suddenly came over the murderer.
<p/>But examine all these facts separately, regardless of their connection. But what if there were something of the sort, a feeling of religious awe, if not of filial respect? '
<p/>My mother must have been praying for me at that moment,' were the prisoner's words at the preliminary inquiry, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) ran away as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) convinced himself that Madame Svyetlov was not in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) father's house. '
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) could not convince himself by looking through the window,' the prosecutor objects. But why couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>)? Why? The window opened at the signals given by the prisoner.
<p/>Some word might have been uttered by Fyodor Pavlovitch, some exclamation which showed the prisoner that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was not there. Why should we assume everything as we imagine it, as we make up our minds to imagine it?
<p/>A thousand things may happen in reality which elude the subtlest imagination. '' ' Yes, but Grigory saw the door open
<p/>Now about that door, gentlemen of the jury.... Observe that we have only the statement of one witness as to that door, and he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was at the time in such a condition, that--
<p/>But supposing the door was open; supposing the prisoner has lied in denying it, from an instinct of self-defense, natural in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) position; supposing he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) did go into the house--well, what then?
<p/>and so the prisoner certainly was in the house, therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) killed him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).' How does it follow that because he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was there he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) committed the murder?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) might have dashed in, run through the rooms; might have pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) father away; might have struck him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>); but as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had made sure Madame Svyetlov was not there, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) may have run away rejoicing that she (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was not there and that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had not killed his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) father.
<p/>And it was perhaps just because he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had escaped from the temptation to kill his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) father, because he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had a clear conscience and was rejoicing at not having killed him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was capable of a pure feeling, the feeling of pity and compassion, and leapt off the fence a minute later to the assistance of Grigory after he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had, in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) excitement, knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) down.
<p/>With terrible eloquence the prosecutor has described to us the dreadful state of the prisoner's mind at Mokroe when love again lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) calling him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) to new life, while love was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) father's bloodstained corpse behind him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) and beyond that corpse--retribution.
<p/>And yet the prosecutor allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) love, which he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) explained, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) method, talking about his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) drunken condition, about a criminal being taken to execution, about it being still far off, and so on and so on.
<p/>Is the prisoner so coarse and heartless as to be able to think at that moment of love and of dodges to escape punishment, if his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hands were really stained with his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) father's blood?
<p/>As soon as it was made plain to him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) and called him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) side, promising him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) new happiness, oh!
<p/>then, I protest he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) must have felt the impulse to suicide doubled, trebled, and must have killed himself, if he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) father's murder on his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) conscience.
<p/>'' But again I ask, Mr. Prosecutor, have you not invented a new personality? No, no, no! Oh, no! he (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) would not have forgotten where his (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) pistols lay!
<p/>I know the prisoner: the savage, stony heartlessness ascribed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prosecutor</b></font>) by the prosecutor is inconsistent with his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) character. He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) would have killed himself, that's certain.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) did not kill himself just because `his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) mother's prayers had saved him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>),' and he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was innocent of his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) father's blood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was troubled, he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was grieving that night at Mokroe only about old Grigory and praying to God that the old man would recover, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blow had not been fatal, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not have to suffer for it.
<p/>Why not accept such an interpretation of the facts? What trustworthy proof have we that the prisoner is lying? '' But we shall be told at once again, `There is his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) father's corpse!
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) ran away without murdering him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), who did murder him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)?' Here, I repeat, you have the whole logic of the prosecution.
<p/>Who murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), if not he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)? There's no one to put in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) place. '' Gentlemen of the jury, is that really so?
<p/>Is it positively, actually true that there is no one else at all? We've heard the prosecutor count on his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) fingers all the persons who were in that house that night.
<p/>They were five in number; three of them, I agree, could not have been responsible-- the murdered man himself, old Grigory, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.
<p/>There are left then the prisoner and Smerdyakov, and the prosecutor dramatically exclaims that the prisoner pointed to Smerdyakov because he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had no one else to fix on, that had there been a sixth person, even a phantom of a sixth person, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would have abandoned the charge against Smerdyakov at once in shame and have accused that other.
<p/>But, gentlemen of the jury, why may I not draw the very opposite conclusion? There are two persons--the prisoner and Smerdyakov.
<p/>Why can I not say that you accuse my client, simply because you have no one else to accuse? And you have no one else only because you have determined to exclude Smerdyakov from all suspicion.
<p/>But there are others who accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>): there are vague rumors of a question, of a suspicion, an obscure report, a feeling of expectation.
<p/>'' It's true, indeed, Smerdyakov is accused only by the prisoner, his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) two brothers, and Madame Svyetlov. Finally, we have the evidence of a combination of facts very suggestive, though, I admit, inconclusive.
<p/>In the first place we have precisely on the day of the catastrophe that fit, for the genuineness of which the prosecutor, for some reason, has felt obliged to make a careful defense.
<p/>Then the equally startling evidence given in court to-day by the elder of the prisoner's brothers, who had believed in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) guilt, but has to-day produced a bundle of notes and proclaimed Smerdyakov as the murderer.
<p/>Oh, I fully share the court's and the prosecutor's conviction that Ivan Karamazov is suffering from brain fever, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) statement may really be a desperate effort, planned in delirium, to save his (<font color='blue'><b>Karamazov</b></font>) brother by throwing the guilt on the dead man.
<p/>Then Smerdyakov's sudden suicide on the eve of the trial. But again Smerdyakov's name is pronounced, again there is a suggestion of mystery.
<p/>There is something unexplained, incomplete. And perhaps it may one day be explained. But we won't go into that now. Of that later.
<p/>The court has resolved to go on with the trial, but, meantime, I might make a few remarks about the character-sketch of Smerdyakov drawn with subtlety and talent by the prosecutor.
<p/>I have visited Smerdyakov, I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) and talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) made a very different impression on me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was weak in health, it is true; but in character, in spirit, he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was by no means the weak man the prosecutor has made him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) out to be.
<p/>'' But while I admire his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) talent I cannot agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>). I found in him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) no trace of the timidity on which the prosecutor so insisted.
<p/>I found in him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>), on the contrary, an extreme mistrustfulness concealed under a mask of naďveté , and an intelligence of considerable range.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) made a very definite impression on me: I left him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) with the conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was a distinctly spiteful creature, excessively ambitious, vindictive, and intensely envious.
<p/>I made some inquiries: he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) resented his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) parentage, was ashamed of it, and would clench his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) teeth when he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was the son of `stinking Lizaveta.'
<p/>There was no simplicity about him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>), either. The prosecutor was too simple in taking him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) for weak-minded. He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was disrespectful to the servant Grigory and his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) wife, who had cared for him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) childhood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) cursed and jeered at Russia. He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) dreamed of going to France and becoming a Frenchman. He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) used often to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) hadn't the means to do so.
<p/>I fancy he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) loved no one but himself and had a strangely high opinion of himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) conception of culture was limited to good clothes, clean shirt-fronts and polished boots.
<p/>Believing himself to be the illegitimate son of Fyodor Pavlovitch -LRB-there is evidence of this-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) might well have resented his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) position, compared with that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) master's legitimate sons.
<p/>They had everything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) nothing. They had all the rights, they had the inheritance, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) was only the cook. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) told me himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had helped Fyodor Pavlovitch to put the notes in the envelope.
<p/>The destination of that sum--a sum which would have made his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) career--must have been hateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>). Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) saw three thousand roubles in new rainbow-colored notes.
<p/>-LRB-I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) about that on purpose.-RRB- Oh, beware of showing an ambitious and envious man a large sum of money at once!
<p/>And it was the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen so much money in the hands of one man. The sight of the rainbow-colored notes may have made a morbid impression on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) imagination, but with no immediate results.
<p/>The talented prosecutor, with extraordinary subtlety, sketched for us all the arguments for and against the hypothesis of Smerdyakov's guilt, and asked us in particular what motive he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had in feigning a fit.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) may not have been feigning at all, the fit may have happened quite naturally, but it may have passed off quite naturally, and the sick man may have recovered, not completely perhaps, but still regaining consciousness, as happens with epileptics.
<p/>'' '' The prosecutor asks at what moment could Smerdyakov have committed the murder. But it is very easy to point out that moment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) might have waked up from deep sleep -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was only asleep--an epileptic fit is always followed by a deep sleep-RRB- at that moment when the old Grigory shouted at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) voice `Parricide!'
<p/>That shout in the dark and stillness may have waked Smerdyakov whose sleep may have been less sound at the moment: he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) might naturally have waked up an hour before.
<p/>Getting out of bed, he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) goes almost unconsciously and with no definite motive towards the sound to see what's the matter.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) head is still clouded with his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) attack, his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) faculties are half asleep; but, once in the garden, he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) walks to the lighted windows and he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) hears terrible news from his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) master, who would be, of course, glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) hears all the details from his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) frightened master, and gradually in his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) disordered brain there shapes itself an idea--terrible, but seductive and irresistibly logical.
<p/>'' His (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) mind sets to work at once. To kill the old man, take the three thousand, and throw all the blame on to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) young master.
<p/>Oh! these sudden and irresistible impulses come so often when there is a favorable opportunity, and especially with murderers who have had no idea of committing a murder beforehand.
<p/>A terrible lust of money, of booty, might seize upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) realized his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) security from detection. And Smerdyakov may have gone in and carried out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plan.
<p/>With what weapon? Why, with any stone picked up in the garden. But what for, with what object? Why, the three thousand which means a career for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Oh, I am not contradicting myself--the money may have existed. And perhaps Smerdyakov alone knew where to find it, where his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master kept it.
<p/>Just now, when the prosecutor was explaining his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) subtle theory that only an inexperienced thief like Karamazov would have left the envelope on the floor, and not one like Smerdyakov, who would have avoided leaving a piece of evidence against himself, I thought as I listened that I was hearing something very familiar, and, would you believe it, I have heard that very argument, that very conjecture, of how Karamazov would have behaved, precisely two days before, from Smerdyakov himself.
<p/>I fancied that there was an artificial simplicity about him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>); that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was in a hurry to suggest this idea to me that I might fancy
<p/>And the covering of the money--the torn envelope on the floor? '' What's more, it struck me at the time. it was my own.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) insinuated it, as it were. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) not insinuate the same idea at the inquiry and suggest it to the talented prosecutor?
<p/>'' I shall be asked, `What about the old woman, Grigory's wife? She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heard the sick man moaning close by, all night.'
<p/>I knew a lady who complained bitterly that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been kept awake all night by a dog in the yard.
<p/>Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heard it, but that evidence is extremely unreliable. Yet the poor beast, it appeared, had only yelped once or twice in the night.
<p/>If any one is asleep and hears a groan he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wakes up, annoyed at being waked, but instantly falls asleep again.
<p/>Two hours later, again a groan, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wakes up and falls asleep again; and the same thing again two hours later--three times altogether in the night.
<p/>And that's natural. Next morning the sleeper wakes up and complains that some one has been groaning all night and keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) awake.
<p/>And it is bound to seem so to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): the intervals of two hours of sleep he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not remember, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only remembers the moments of waking, so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feels he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been waked up all night.
<p/>'' But why, why, asks the prosecutor, did not Smerdyakov confess in his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) last letter? Why did his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) conscience prompt him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) to one step and not to both?
<p/>But, excuse me, conscience implies penitence, and the suicide may not have felt penitence, but only despair. Despair and penitence are two very different things.
<p/>Despair may be vindictive and irreconcilable, and the suicide, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) hands on himself, may well have felt redoubled hatred for those whom he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had envied all his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) life.
<p/>'' Gentlemen of the jury, beware of a miscarriage of justice! What is there unlikely in all I have put before you just now?
<p/>And if there is but a shade of possibility, but a shade of probability in my propositions, do not condemn him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>).
<p/>I swear by all that is sacred, I fully believe in the explanation of the murder I have just put forward.
<p/>What troubles me and makes me indignant is that of all the mass of facts heaped up by the prosecution against the prisoner, there is not a single one certain and irrefutable.
<p/>Find the error in my reasoning; find the impossibility, the absurdity. And is there only a shade? And yet the unhappy man is to be ruined by the accumulation of these facts.
<p/>Yes, the accumulated effect is awful: the blood, the blood dripping from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers, the bloodstained shirt, the dark night resounding with the shout `Parricide!'
<p/>this has so much influence, it can so bias the mind; but, gentlemen of the jury, can it bias your minds?
<p/>Remember, you have been given absolute power to bind and to loose, but the greater the power, the more terrible its responsibility.
<p/>I do not draw back one iota from what I have said just now, but suppose for one moment I agreed with the prosecution that my luckless client had stained his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) hands with his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) father's blood.
<p/>and the old man falling with a broken head. And then the mass of phrases, statements, gestures, shouts! Oh! '' This is only hypothesis, I repeat;
<p/>I never for one instant doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) innocence. But, so be it , I assume that my client is guilty of parricide.
<p/>Even so, hear what I have to say. I have it in my heart to say something more to you, for I feel that there must be a great conflict in your hearts and minds....
<p/>Forgive my referring to your hearts and minds, gentlemen of the jury, but I want to be truthful and sincere to the end.
<p/>The last words, indeed, were pronounced with a note of such sincerity that every one felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) really might have something to say, and that what he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) was about to say would be of the greatest consequence.
<p/>But the President, hearing the applause, in a loud voice threatened to clear the court if such an incident were repeated.
<p/>Every sound was hushed and Fetyukovitch began in a voice full of feeling quite unlike the tone he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had used hitherto.
<p/>Let us all be sincere!'' At this point the speech was interrupted by rather loud applause. Chapter XIII. A Corrupter Of Thought
<p/>It's not only the accumulation of facts that threatens my client with ruin, gentlemen of the jury,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``what is really damning for my client is one fact--the dead body of his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) father.
<p/>Had it been an ordinary case of murder you would have rejected the charge in view of the triviality, the incompleteness, and the fantastic character of the evidence, if you examine each part of it separately; or, at least, you would have hesitated to ruin a man's life simply from the prejudice against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has, alas!
<p/>That impresses men's minds, and to such a degree that the very triviality and incompleteness of the evidence becomes less trivial and less incomplete even to an unprejudiced mind.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>only too well deserved. But it's not an ordinary case of murder, it's a case of parricide. How can such a prisoner be acquitted?
<p/>What if he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) committed the murder and gets off unpunished? That is what every one, almost involuntarily, instinctively, feels at heart.
<p/>Yes, it's a fearful thing to shed a father's blood--the father who has begotten me, loved me, not spared his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life for me, grieved over my illnesses from childhood up, troubled all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life for my happiness, and has lived in my joys, in my successes.
<p/>'' To murder such a father--that's inconceivable. Gentlemen of the jury, what is a father--a real father? What is the meaning of that great word?
<p/>What is the great idea in that name? We have just indicated in part what a true father is and what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ought to be.
<p/>In the case in which we are now so deeply occupied and over which our hearts are aching--in the present case, the father, Fyodor Pavlovitch Karamazov, did not correspond to that conception of a father to which we have just referred.
<p/>Let us examine this misfortune rather more closely: we must shrink from nothing, gentlemen of the jury, considering the importance of the decision you have to make.
<p/>It's our particular duty not to shrink from any idea, like children or frightened women, as the talented prosecutor happily expresses it.
<p/>But in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) heated speech my esteemed opponent -LRB-and he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) was my opponent before I opened my lips-RRB- exclaimed several times, `Oh, I will not yield the defense of the prisoner to the lawyer who has come down from Petersburg.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) exclaimed that several times, but forgot to mention that if this terrible prisoner was for twenty-three years so grateful for a mere pound of nuts given him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) by the only man who had been kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as a child in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's house, might not such a man well have remembered for twenty-three years how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's back-yard, `without boots on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feet and with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) little trousers hanging by one button'--to use the expression of the kind-hearted doctor, Herzenstube?
<p/>That's the misfortune. And indeed some fathers are a misfortune. '' I accuse, but I defend also!' '' Oh, gentlemen of the jury, why need we look more closely at this misfortune
<p/>What did my client meet with when he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) arrived here, at his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) father's house, and why depict my client as a heartless egoist and monster?
<p/>, why repeat what we all know already? He (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) is uncontrolled, he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) is wild and unruly--we are trying him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) now for that--but who is responsible for his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) life?
<p/>Who is responsible for his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) having received such an unseemly bringing up, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) excellent disposition and his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) grateful and sensitive heart?
<p/>Did any one train him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) to be reasonable? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) enlightened by study? Did any one love him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) ever so little in his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) childhood?
<p/>My client was left to the care of Providence like a beast of the field. He (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) thirsted perhaps to see his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) father after long years of separation.
<p/>A thousand times perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) may, recalling his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) childhood, have driven away the loathsome phantoms that haunted his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) childish dreams and with all his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) may have longed to embrace and to forgive his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) father!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) heard nothing but revolting talk and vicious precepts uttered daily over the brandy, and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) father seducing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mistress from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own money.
<p/>And what awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was met by cynical taunts, suspicions and wrangling about money. Oh, gentlemen of the jury, that was cruel and revolting!
<p/>And that old man was always complaining of the disrespect and cruelty of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slandered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in society, injured him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), calumniated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), bought up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unpaid debts to get him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thrown into prison.
<p/>Gentlemen of the jury, people like my client, who are fierce, unruly, and uncontrolled on the surface, are sometimes, most frequently indeed, exceedingly tender-hearted, only they don't express it.
<p/>'' Don't laugh, don't laugh at my idea! The talented prosecutor laughed mercilessly just now at my client for loving Schiller--loving the sublime and beautiful!
<p/>I should not have laughed at that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) place. Yes, such natures-- oh, let me speak in defense of such natures,
<p/>so often and so cruelly misunderstood--these natures often thirst for tenderness, goodness, and justice, as it were, in contrast to themselves, their unruliness, their ferocity--they thirst for it unconsciously.
<p/>Passionate and fierce on the surface, they are painfully capable of loving woman, for instance, and with a spiritual and elevated love.
<p/>Again do not laugh at me, this is very often the case in such natures. But they cannot hide their passions--sometimes very coarse--and that is conspicuous and is noticed, but the inner man is unseen.
<p/>Their passions are quickly exhausted; but, by the side of a noble and lofty creature that seemingly coarse and rough man seeks a new life, seeks to correct himself, to be better, to become noble and honorable, `sublime and beautiful,' however much the expression has been ridiculed.
<p/>'' I said just now that I would not venture to touch upon my client's engagement. But I may say half a word.
<p/>What we heard just now was not evidence, but only the scream of a frenzied and revengeful woman, and it was not for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--oh, not for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!--to reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) with treachery, for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has betrayed him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>)!
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had had but a little time for reflection she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would not have given such evidence. Oh, do not believe her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!
<p/>No, my client is not a monster, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>)! '' The Lover of Mankind on the eve of His (<font color='blue'><b>Lover</b></font>) Crucifixion said: 'I am the Good Shepherd.
<p/>The good shepherd lays down his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) life for his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) sheep, so that not one of them might be lost.' Let not a man's soul be lost through us! ''
<p/>But one must use words honestly, gentlemen, and I venture to call things by their right names: such a father as old Karamazov cannot be called a father and does not deserve to be.
<p/>I asked just now what does `father' mean, and exclaimed that it was a great word, a precious name. Filial love for an unworthy father is an absurdity, an impossibility.
<p/>Love cannot be created from nothing: only God can create something from nothing. '' `Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath,' the apostle writes, from a heart glowing with love.
<p/>It's not for the sake of my client that I quote these sacred words, I mention them for all fathers. Who has authorized me to preach to fathers?
<p/>No one. But as a man and a citizen I make my appeal-- vivos voco! We are not long on earth, we do many evil deeds and say many evil words.
<p/>So let us all catch a favorable moment when we are all together to say a good word to each other.
<p/>That's what I am doing: while I am in this place I take advantage of my opportunity. Not for nothing is this tribune given us by the highest authority--all Russia hears us!
<p/>I am not speaking only for the fathers here present, I cry aloud to all fathers: `Fathers, provoke not your children to wrath.'
<p/>Otherwise we are not fathers, but enemies of our children, and they are not our children, but our enemies, and we have made them our enemies ourselves. '
<p/>Yes, let us first fulfill Christ's injunction ourselves and only then venture to expect it of our children. What measure ye mete
<p/>it shall be measured unto you again'--it's not I who say that, it's the Gospel precept, measure to others according as they measure to you.
<p/>How can we blame children if they measure us according to our measure? <div class="bookquote">``Not long ago a servant girl in Finland was suspected of having secretly given birth to a child.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was watched, and a box of which no one knew anything was found in the corner of the loft, behind some bricks.
<p/>In the same box were found the skeletons of two other babies which, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own confession, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had killed at the moment of their birth.
<p/>It was opened and inside was found the body of a new-born child which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had killed. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Gentlemen</b></font>)</div>Gentlemen of the jury, was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a mother to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) children?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gave birth to them, indeed; but was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a mother to them? Would any one venture to give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) the sacred name of mother?
<p/>Let us be bold, gentlemen, let us be audacious even: it's our duty to be so at this moment and not to be afraid of certain words and ideas like the Moscow women in Ostrovsky's play, who are scared at the sound of certain words.
<p/>No, let us prove that the progress of the last few years has touched even us, and let us say plainly, the father is not merely he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) who begets the child, but
<p/>Oh, of course, there is the other meaning, there is the other interpretation of the word `father,' which insists that any father, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) be a monster, even though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) be the enemy of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) children, still remains my father simply because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) begot me.
<p/>But this is, so to say, the mystical meaning which I cannot comprehend with my intellect, but can only accept by faith, or, better to say, on faith , like many other things which I do not understand, but which religion bids me believe.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) who begets it and does his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) duty by it. '' But in that case let it be kept outside the sphere of actual life.
<p/>In the sphere of actual life, which has, indeed, its own rights, but also lays upon us great duties and obligations, in that sphere, if we want to be humane--Christian, in fact--we must, or ought to, act only upon convictions justified by reason and experience, which have been passed through the crucible of analysis; in a word, we must act rationally, and not as though in dream and delirium, that we may not do harm, that we may not ill-treat and ruin a man.
<p/>There was violent applause at this passage from many parts of the court, but Fetyukovitch waved his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands as though imploring them to let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finish without interruption.
<p/>Then it will be real Christian work, not only mystic, but rational and philanthropic... '' The court relapsed into silence at once.
<p/>The orator went on. '' Do you suppose, gentlemen, that our children as they grow up and begin to reason can avoid such questions?
<p/>The sight of an unworthy father involuntarily suggests tormenting questions to a young creature, especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) compares him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with the excellent fathers of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) companions.
<p/>The conventional answer to this question is: `He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) begot you, and you are his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) flesh and blood, and therefore you are bound to love him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).'
<p/>No, they cannot, and we will not impose on them an impossible restriction. The youth involuntarily reflects: ' But did he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) love me when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) begot me?'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not know me, not even my sex, at that moment, at the moment of passion, perhaps, inflamed by wine, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has only transmitted to me a propensity to drunkenness
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asks, wondering more and more. ' Was it for my sake he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) begot me? --that's all he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'s done for me....
<p/>Why am I bound to love him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) simply for begetting me when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has cared nothing for me all my life after?'
<p/>Oh, perhaps those questions strike you as coarse and cruel, but do not expect an impossible restraint from a young mind. '
<p/>Drive nature out of the door and it will fly in at the window,' and, above all, let us not be afraid of words, but decide the question according to the dictates of reason and humanity and not of mystic ideas.
<p/>'' How shall it be decided? Why, like this. Let the son stand before his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), `Father, tell me, why must I love you?
<p/>if that father is able to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and show him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) good reason, we have a real, normal, parental relation, not resting on mystical prejudice, but on a rational, responsible and strictly humanitarian basis.
<p/>Father, show me that I must love you,' and But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) does not, there's an end to the family tie.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) is not a father to him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), and the son has a right to look upon him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) as a stranger, and even an enemy.
<p/>Our tribune, gentlemen of the jury, ought to be a school of true and sound ideas. '' -LRB-Here the orator was interrupted by irrepressible and almost frantic applause.
<p/>Of course, it was not the whole audience, but a good half of it applauded. The fathers and mothers present applauded.
<p/>Shrieks and exclamations were heard from the gallery, where the ladies were sitting. Handkerchiefs were waved. The President began ringing his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) bell with all his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) might.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) was obviously irritated by the behavior of the audience, but did not venture to clear the court as he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had threatened.
<p/>Even persons of high position, old men with stars on their breasts, sitting on specially reserved seats behind the judges, applauded the orator and waved their handkerchiefs.
<p/>So that when the noise died down, the President confined himself to repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) stern threat to clear the court, and Fetyukovitch, excited and triumphant, continued his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) speech.-RRB-
<p/>Gentlemen of the jury, you remember that awful night of which so much has been said to-day, when the son got over the fence and stood face to face with the enemy and persecutor who had begotten him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>I insist most emphatically it was not for money he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) ran to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father's house: the charge of robbery is an absurdity, as I proved before.
<p/>'' And it was not to murder him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) broke into the house, oh, no! If he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had had that design he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would, at least, have taken the precaution of arming himself beforehand.
<p/>Granted that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) deceived his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father by tapping at the window, granted that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) way in--I've said already that I do not for a moment believe that legend, but let it be so, let us suppose it for a moment.
<p/>Gentlemen, I swear to you by all that's holy, if it had not been his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father, but an ordinary enemy, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would, after running through the rooms and satisfying himself that the woman was not there, have made off, post-haste, without doing any harm to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) rival.
<p/>The brass pestle he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) caught up instinctively without knowing why he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did it. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would have struck him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) away perhaps,
<p/>nothing more, for he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had no thought and no time to spare for that. What he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wanted to know was where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was.
<p/>The mere sight of the father who had hated him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) childhood, had been his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) enemy, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) persecutor, and now his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) unnatural rival, was enough!
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father! A feeling of hatred came over him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) involuntarily, irresistibly, clouding his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) reason. It all surged up in one moment!
<p/>It was an impulse of madness and insanity, but also an impulse of nature, irresistibly and unconsciously -LRB-like everything in nature-RRB- avenging the violation of its eternal laws.
<p/>But the prisoner even then did not murder him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>)--I maintain that, I cry that aloud!--no, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) only brandished the pestle in a burst of indignant disgust, not meaning to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), not knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would kill him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) not had this fatal pestle in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would have only knocked his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) father down perhaps, but would not have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
<p/>'' As he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) ran away, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) did not know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had killed the old man. Such a murder is not a murder.
<p/>Such a murder is not a parricide. No, the murder of such a father cannot be called parricide. Such a murder can only be reckoned parricide by prejudice.
<p/>'' But I appeal to you again and again from the depths of my soul; did this murder actually take place?
<p/>Gentlemen of the jury, if we convict and punish him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will say to himself: `These people have done nothing for my bringing up, for my education, nothing to improve my lot, nothing to make me better, nothing to make me a man.
<p/>These people have not given me to eat and to drink, have not visited me in prison and nakedness, and here they have sent me to penal servitude.
<p/>I am quits, I owe them nothing now, and owe no one anything for ever. They are wicked and I will be wicked.
<p/>And I swear, by finding him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guilty you will only make it easier for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): you will ease his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conscience, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will curse the blood he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has shed and will not regret it.
<p/>At the same time you will destroy in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the possibility of becoming a new man, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will remain in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wickedness and blindness all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life.
<p/>But do you want to punish him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fearfully, terribly, with the most awful punishment that could be imagined, and at the same time to save him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and regenerate his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul?
<p/>They are cruel and I will be cruel.' That is what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will say, gentlemen of the jury. '' If so, overwhelm him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with your mercy!
<p/>You will see, you will hear how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will tremble and be horror-struck. ' How can I endure this mercy? How can I endure so much love?
<p/>Am I worthy of it?' That's what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will exclaim. '' Oh, I know, I know that heart, that wild but grateful heart, gentlemen of the jury!
<p/>It will bow before your mercy; it thirsts for a great and loving action, it will melt and mount upwards. There are souls which, in their limitation, blame the whole world.
<p/>But subdue such a soul with mercy, show it love, and it will curse its past, for there are many good impulses in it.
<p/>Such a heart will expand and see that God is merciful and that men are good and just. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will be horror-stricken; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will be crushed by remorse and the vast obligation laid upon him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) henceforth.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will not say then, 'I am quits,' but will say, 'I am guilty in the sight of all men and am more unworthy than all.'
<p/>With tears of penitence and poignant, tender anguish, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will exclaim: `Others are better than I, they wanted to save me, not to ruin me!'
<p/>Oh, this act of mercy is so easy for you, for in the absence of anything like real evidence it will be too awful for you to pronounce: `Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is guilty.'
<p/>'' Better acquit ten guilty men than punish one innocent man! Do you hear, do you hear that majestic voice from the past century of our glorious history?
<p/>It is not for an insignificant person like me to remind you that the Russian court does not exist for the punishment only, but also for the salvation of the criminal!
<p/>Let other nations think of retribution and the letter of the law, we will cling to the spirit and the meaning--the salvation and the reformation of the lost.
<p/>If this is true, if Russia and her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) justice are such, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) may go forward with good cheer! Do not try to scare us with your frenzied troikas from which all the nations stand aside in disgust.
<p/>Not a runaway troika, but the stately chariot of Russia will move calmly and majestically to its goal. In your hands is the fate of my client, in your hands is the fate of Russian justice.
<p/>You will defend it, you will save it, you will prove that there are men to watch over it, that it is in good hands!''
<p/>Chapter XIV. The Peasants Stand Firm This was how Fetyukovitch concluded his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) speech, and the enthusiasm of the audience burst like an irresistible storm.
<p/>It was out of the question to stop it: the women wept, many of the men wept too, even two important personages shed tears.
<p/>The President submitted, and even postponed ringing his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) bell. The suppression of such an enthusiasm would be the suppression of something sacred, as the ladies cried afterwards.
<p/>The orator himself was genuinely touched. And it was at this moment that Ippolit Kirillovitch got up to make certain objections.
<p/>People looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) with hatred. '' What? What's the meaning of it? He (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) positively dares to make objections,'' the ladies babbled.
<p/>But if the whole world of ladies, including his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) wife, had protested he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) could not have been stopped at that moment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) was pale, he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) was shaking with emotion, his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) first phrases were even unintelligible, he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) gasped for breath, could hardly speak clearly, lost the thread.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) soon recovered himself. Of this new speech of his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) I will quote only a few sentences. ''... I am reproached with having woven a romance.
<p/>But what is this defense if not one romance on the top of another? All that was lacking was poetry. Fyodor Pavlovitch, while waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) mistress, tears open the envelope and throws it on the floor.
<p/>We are even told what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) said while engaged in this strange act. Is not this a flight of fancy? And what proof have we that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pavlovitch</b></font>) had taken out the money?
<p/>The weak-minded idiot, Smerdyakov, transformed into a Byronic hero, avenging society for his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) illegitimate birth--isn't this a romance in the Byronic style?
<p/>And the son who breaks into his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father's house and murders him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) without murdering him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is not even a romance--this is a sphinx setting us a riddle which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) cannot solve himself.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), and what's the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) murdering him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) without having murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)--who can make head or tail of this?
<p/>Then we are admonished that our tribune is a tribune of true and sound ideas and from this tribune of `sound ideas' is heard a solemn declaration that to call the murder of a father `parricide' is nothing but a prejudice!
<p/>But if parricide is a prejudice, and if every child is to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father why he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is to love him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), what will become of us?
<p/>Who heard what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said? '' What will become of the foundations of society? What will become of the family? Parricide, it appears, is only a bogy of Moscow merchants' wives.
<p/>The most precious, the most sacred guarantees for the destiny and future of Russian justice are presented to us in a perverted and frivolous form, simply to attain an object--to obtain the justification of something which cannot be justified. '
<p/>Oh, crush him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) by mercy,' cries the counsel for the defense; but that's all the criminal wants, and to-morrow it will be seen how much he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) is crushed.
<p/>And is not the counsel for the defense too modest in asking only for the acquittal of the prisoner? Why not found a charity in the honor of the parricide to commemorate his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) exploit among future generations?
<p/>Religion and the Gospel are corrected--that's all mysticism, we are told, and ours is the only true Christianity which has been subjected to the analysis of reason and common sense.
<p/>so it shall be meted unto you again,' cried the counsel for the defense, and instantly deduces that Christ teaches us to measure as it is measured to us--and this from the tribune of truth and sound sense!
<p/>We peep into the Gospel only on the eve of making speeches, in order to dazzle the audience by our acquaintance with what is, anyway, a rather original composition, which may be of use to produce a certain effect--all to serve the purpose!
<p/>And so they set up before us a false semblance of Christ! ' What measure ye mete But what Christ commands us is something very different
<p/>: He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) bids us beware of doing this, because the wicked world does this, but we ought to forgive and to turn the other cheek, and not to measure to our persecutors as they measure to us.
<p/>This is what our God has taught us and not that to forbid children to murder their fathers is a prejudice.
<p/>correct the Gospel of our Lord, Whom the counsel for the defense deigns to call only `the crucified lover of humanity,' in opposition to all orthodox Russia, which calls to Him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), `For Thou art our God!'
<p/>At this the President intervened and checked the over-zealous speaker, begging him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) not to exaggerate, not to overstep the bounds, and so on, as presidents always do in such cases.
<p/>And we will not from the tribune of truth and good sense '' The audience, too, was uneasy. The public was restless: there were even exclamations of indignation.
<p/>Fetyukovitch did not so much as reply; he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) only mounted the tribune to lay his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) heart and, with an offended voice, utter a few words full of dignity.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) only touched again, lightly and ironically, on <div class="bookquote">``romancing''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``psychology,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and in an appropriate place quoted, <div class="bookquote">``Jupiter, you are angry, therefore you are wrong,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>which provoked a burst of approving laughter in the audience, for Ippolit Kirillovitch was by no means like Jupiter.
<p/>Then, ŕ propos of the accusation that he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) was teaching the young generation to murder their fathers, Fetyukovitch observed, with great dignity, that he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) would not even answer.
<p/>As for the prosecutor's charge of uttering unorthodox opinions, Fetyukovitch hinted that it was a personal insinuation and that he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had expected in this court to be secure from accusations <div class="bookquote">``damaging to my reputation as a citizen and a loyal subject.
<p/>But at these words the President pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) up, too, and Fetyukovitch concluded his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) speech with a bow, amid a hum of approbation in the court.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And Ippolit Kirillovitch was, in the opinion of our ladies, <div class="bookquote">``crushed for good. ''  (<font color='red'><b>ladies</b></font>)</div>Then the prisoner was allowed to speak.
<p/>Mitya stood up, but said very little. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was fearfully exhausted, physically and mentally. The look of strength and independence with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had entered in the morning had almost disappeared.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seemed as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had passed through an experience that day, which had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) life something very important he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had not understood till then.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) voice was weak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) did not shout as before. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) words there was a new note of humility, defeat and submission.
<p/>'' What am I to say, gentlemen of the jury? The hour of judgment has come for me, I feel the hand of God upon me!
<p/>The end has come to an erring man! But, before God, I repeat to you, I am innocent of my father's blood!
<p/>For the last time I repeat, it wasn't I killed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)! I was erring, but I loved what is good. Every instant I strove to reform, but
<p/>I thank the prosecutor, he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) told me many things about myself that I did not know; but it's not true that I killed my father, the prosecutor is mistaken.
<p/>I lived like a wild beast. I thank my counsel, too. I cried listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>); but it's not true that I killed my father, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) needn't have supposed it.
<p/>And don't believe the doctors. I am perfectly sane, only my heart is heavy. If you spare me, if you let me go, I will pray for you.
<p/>I will be a better man. I give you my word before God I will! And if you will condemn me, I'll break my sword over my head myself and kiss the pieces.
<p/>But spare me, do not rob me of my God! I know myself, I shall rebel! My heart is heavy, gentlemen ... spare me!''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) almost fell back in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) place: his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) voice broke: he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could hardly articulate the last phrase. Then the judges proceeded to put the questions and began to ask both sides to formulate their conclusions.
<p/>But I will not describe the details. At last the jury rose to retire for consultation. The President was very tired, and so his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) last charge to the jury was rather feeble.
<p/>'' Be impartial, don't be influenced by the eloquence of the defense, but yet weigh the arguments. Remember that there is a great responsibility laid upon you,'' and so on and so on.
<p/>The jury withdrew and the court adjourned. People could get up, move about, exchange their accumulated impressions, refresh themselves at the buffet.
<p/>It was very late, almost one o'clock in the night, but nobody went away: the strain was so great that no one could think of repose.
<p/>All waited with sinking hearts; though that is, perhaps, too much to say, for the ladies were only in a state of hysterical impatience and their hearts were untroubled.
<p/>An acquittal, they thought, was inevitable. They all prepared themselves for a dramatic moment of general enthusiasm. I must own there were many among the men, too, who were convinced that an acquittal was inevitable.
<p/>Some were pleased, others frowned, while some were simply dejected, not wanting him (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) to be acquitted. Fetyukovitch himself was confident of his (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) success.
<p/>There are,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) said to one group, as I was told afterwards, <div class="bookquote">``there are invisible threads binding the counsel for the defense with the jury.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) was surrounded by people congratulating him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) and fawning upon him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>One feels during one's speech if they are being formed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What will our peasants say now?''  (<font color='red'><b>gentleman</b></font>)</div>said one stout, cross-looking, pock- marked gentleman, a landowner of the neighborhood, approaching a group of gentlemen engaged in conversation.
<p/>I was aware of them. They exist. Our cause is won. Set your mind at rest. '' '' But they are not all peasants.
<p/>There are four government clerks among them. '' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, there are clerks,''  (<font color='red'><b>a member</b></font>)</div>said a member of the district council, joining the group.
<p/>'' And do you know that Nazaryev, the merchant with the medal, a juryman?'' <div class="bookquote">``What of him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) is a man with brains.''
<p/>'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) never speaks.'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) is no great talker, but so much the better. There's no need for the Petersburg man to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could teach all Petersburg himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s the father of twelve children. Think of that!'' <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, you don't suppose they won't acquit him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>officials</b></font>)</div>one of our young officials exclaimed in another group.
<p/>'' They'll acquit him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for certain,'' said a resolute voice. '' It would be shameful, disgraceful, not to acquit him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!'' cried the official.
<p/>'' Suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did murder him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--there are fathers and fathers! And, besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in such a frenzy.... He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really may have done nothing but swing the pestle in the air, and so knocked the old man down.
<p/>If I'd been in Fetyukovitch's place, I should simply have said straight out: `He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not guilty, hang it all!'
<p/>But it was a pity they dragged the valet in. That was simply an absurd theory! '' '' That's what he (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>) did, only without saying, `Hang it all!' ''
<p/>Why, gentlemen, in Lent an actress was acquitted in our town who had cut the throat of her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) lover's lawful wife.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Mihail Semyonovitch, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) almost said that, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>put in a third voice. '' '' Oh, but she (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) did not finish cutting it.''

<p/>Is there any justice to be had in Russia? '' But the bell rang. The jury deliberated for exactly an hour, neither more nor less.
<p/>A profound silence reigned in the court as soon as the public had taken their seats. I remember how the jurymen walked into the court.
<p/>I remember only the answer to the President's first and chief question: <div class="bookquote">``Did the prisoner commit the murder for the sake of robbery and with premeditation?
<p/>At last! I won't repeat the questions in order, and, indeed, I have forgotten them. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the President</b></font>)</div>-LRB-I don't remember the exact words.-RRB-
<p/>The foreman of the jury, the youngest of the clerks, pronounced, in a clear, loud voice, amidst the deathlike stillness of the court: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, guilty!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the clerks</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a complete hush. And the same answer was repeated to every question: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, guilty!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and without the slightest extenuating comment.
<p/>This no one had expected; almost every one had reckoned upon a recommendation to mercy, at least. The deathlike silence in the court was not broken--
<p/>all seemed petrified: those who desired his (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) conviction as well as those who had been eager for his (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) acquittal. But that was only for the first instant, and it was followed by a fearful hubbub.
<p/>Many of the men in the audience were pleased. Some were rubbing their hands with no attempt to conceal their joy.
<p/>Those who disagreed with the verdict seemed crushed, shrugged their shoulders, whispered, but still seemed unable to realize this. But how shall I describe the state the ladies were in?
<p/>I thought they would create a riot. At first they could scarcely believe their ears. Then suddenly the whole court rang with exclamations:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What's the meaning of it? What next? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They leapt up from their places. They seemed to fancy that it might be at once reconsidered and reversed.
<p/>At that instant Mitya suddenly stood up and cried in a heartrending voice, stretching his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hands out before him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``I swear by God and the dreadful Day of Judgment
<p/>I am not guilty of my father's blood! Katya, I forgive you! Brothers, friends, have pity on the other woman! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not go on, and broke into a terrible sobbing wail that was heard all over the court in a strange, unnatural voice unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own.
<p/>From the farthest corner at the back of the gallery came a piercing shriek--it was Grushenka. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had succeeded in begging admittance to the court again before the beginning of the lawyers' speeches.
<p/>Mitya was taken away. The passing of the sentence was deferred till next day. The whole court was in a hubbub
<p/>but I did not wait to hear. I only remember a few exclamations I heard on the steps as I went out.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'ll have a twenty years' trip to the mines!'' <div class="bookquote">``Not less.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, our peasants have stood firm.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>'' And have done for our Mitya.''
<p/>EPILOGUE Chapter I. Plans For Mitya's Escape Very early, at nine o'clock in the morning, five days after the trial, Alyosha went to Katerina Ivanovna's to talk over a matter of great importance to both of them, and to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) a message.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) sat and talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) in the very room in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had once received Grushenka. In the next room Ivan Fyodorovitch lay unconscious in a high fever.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna had immediately after the scene at the trial ordered the sick and unconscious man to be carried to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) house, disregarding the inevitable gossip and general disapproval of the public.
<p/>One of the two relations who lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had departed to Moscow immediately after the scene in court, the other remained.
<p/>But if both had gone away, Katerina Ivanovna would have adhered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) resolution, and would have gone on nursing the sick man and sitting by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) day and night.
<p/>The famous doctor had gone back to Moscow, refusing to give an opinion as to the probable end of the illness.
<p/>Though the doctors encouraged Katerina Ivanovna and Alyosha, it was evident that they could not yet give them positive hopes of recovery.
<p/>But this time he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had specially urgent business, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) foresaw how difficult it would be to approach the subject, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was in great haste.
<p/>Varvinsky and Herzenstube were attending him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). Alyosha came to see his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sick brother twice a day. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had another engagement that could not be put off for that same morning, and there was need of haste.
<p/>They had been talking for a quarter of an hour. Katerina Ivanovna was pale and terribly fatigued, yet at the same time in a state of hysterical excitement.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) had a presentiment of the reason why Alyosha had come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>). '' Don't worry about his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) decision,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) said, with confident emphasis to Alyosha.
<p/>That unhappy man, that hero of honor and principle--not he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), not Dmitri Fyodorovitch, but the man lying the other side of that door, who has sacrificed himself for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother,'' Katya added, with flashing eyes--<div class="bookquote">``told me the whole plan of escape long ago.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Katya/KATYA</b></font>)</div>One way or another he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is bound to come to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must escape. You know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has already entered into negotiations....
<p/>You see, it will probably come off at the third étape from here, when the party of prisoners is being taken to Siberia.
<p/>I've told you something already.... Oh, it's a long way off yet. Ivan Fyodorovitch has already visited the superintendent of the third étape .
<p/>But we don't know yet who will be in charge of the party, and it's impossible to find that out so long beforehand.
<p/>To-morrow perhaps I will show you in detail the whole plan which Ivan Fyodorovitch left me on the eve of the trial in case of need....
<p/>That was when--do you remember?--you found us quarreling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had just gone down-stairs, but seeing you I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) come back; do you remember?
<p/>Do you know what we were quarreling about then?'' '' No, I don't,'' said Alyosha. '' Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) did not tell you.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) had told me the main idea three days before, and we began quarreling about it at once and quarreled for three days.
<p/>We quarreled because, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) told me that if Dmitri Fyodorovitch were convicted he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) would escape abroad with that creature, I felt furious at once--I can't tell you why, I don't know myself
<p/>It was about that plan of escape. why.... Oh, of course, I was furious then about that creature, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>creature</b></font>), too, should go abroad with Dmitri!''
<p/>As soon as Ivan Fyodorovitch saw that I was furious about that woman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) instantly imagined I was jealous of Dmitri and that I still loved Dmitri.
<p/>Katerina Ivanovna exclaimed suddenly, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivanovna</b></font>) lips quivering with anger. '' That is how our first quarrel began. I would not give an explanation, I could not ask forgiveness.
<p/>I could not bear to think that such a man could suspect me of still loving that ... and when I myself had told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) long before that I did not love Dmitri, that I loved no one but him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)!
<p/>Three days later, on the evening you came, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) brought me a sealed envelope, which I was to open at once, if anything happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) told me that the envelope contained the details of the escape, and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) died or was taken dangerously ill, I was to save Mitya alone.
<p/>It was only resentment against that creature that made me angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) foresaw his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) illness! Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) left me money, nearly ten thousand--
<p/>those notes to which the prosecutor referred in his (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) speech, having learnt from some one that he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) had sent them to be changed.
<p/>I was tremendously impressed to find that Ivan Fyodorovitch had not given up his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) idea of saving his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) brother, and was confiding this plan of escape to me, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) was still jealous of me and still convinced that I loved Mitya.
<p/>I wanted to fall at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) feet in reverence, but I thought at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would take it only for my joy at the thought of Mitya's being saved -LRB-and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) certainly would have imagined that!-RRB-
<p/>, and I was so exasperated at the mere possibility of such an unjust thought on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) part that I lost my temper again, and instead of kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) feet, flew into a fury again!
<p/>Oh, that was a sacrifice! No, you cannot understand the greatness of such self-sacrifice, Alexey Fyodorovitch. Oh, I am unhappy! It's my character, my awful, unhappy character!
<p/>Oh, you will see, I shall end by driving him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), too, to abandon me for another with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) can get on better, like Dmitri.
<p/>And when you came in then, and when I called to you and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) to come back, I was so enraged by the look of contempt and hatred
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) turned on me that--do you remember?--I cried out to you that it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) alone who had persuaded me that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) brother Dmitri was a murderer!
<p/>But ... no, I could not bear it, I should kill myself. I said that malicious thing on purpose to wound him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had never, never persuaded me that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) brother was a murderer. On the contrary, it was I who persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) wanted to show me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) was an honorable man, and that, even if I loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) would not ruin him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) for revenge or jealousy.
<p/>Oh, my vile temper was the cause of everything! I paved the way to that hideous scene at the trial. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) came to the court ...
<p/>Katya never had made such confessions to Alyosha before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) was now at that stage of unbearable suffering when even the proudest heart painfully crushes its pride and falls vanquished by grief.
<p/>Oh, Alyosha knew another terrible reason of her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) present misery, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) had carefully concealed it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) during those days since the trial; but it would have been for some reason too painful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) had been brought so low as to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) now about that.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) was suffering for her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``treachery''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>at the trial, and Alyosha felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) conscience was impelling her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) to confess it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), Alyosha, with tears and cries and hysterical writhings on the floor.
<p/>I am the cause of it all, I alone am to blame!'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) dreaded that moment and longed to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>).
<p/>It made the commission on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) had come even more difficult. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) spoke of Mitya again. '' It's all right, it's all right, don't be anxious about him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>)!
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) began again, sharply and stubbornly. '' All that is only momentary, I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>), I know his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) heart only too well.
<p/>You may be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) will consent to escape. It's not as though it would be immediately; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) will have time to make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) mind to it.
<p/>Ivan Fyodorovitch will be well by that time and will manage it all himself, so that I shall have nothing to do with it.
<p/>Don't be anxious; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) will consent to run away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) has agreed already: do you suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) would give up that creature?
<p/>And they won't let her (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), so he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is bound to escape. It's you he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>)'s most afraid of , he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) is afraid you won't approve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) escape on moral grounds.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) talks about some hymn,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dmitri</b></font>) went on again, <div class="bookquote">``some cross he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) has to bear, some duty; I remember Ivan Fyodorovitch told me a great deal about it, and if you knew how he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) talked!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Katya cried suddenly, with feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) could not repress, <div class="bookquote">``if you knew how he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) loved that wretched man at the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) told me, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>), perhaps, at the same moment.
<p/>But you must generously allow it, if your sanction is so necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Katya added viciously. She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) paused and smiled. '' And I heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) story and his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) tears with sneering disdain.
<p/>Brute! Yes, I am a brute. I am responsible for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fyodorovitch</b></font>) fever. But that man in prison is incapable of suffering,'' Katya concluded irritably.
<p/>'' Can such a man suffer? Men like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never suffer! '' There was a note of hatred and contemptuous repulsion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) words.
<p/>And yet it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) who had betrayed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' Perhaps because she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) feels how she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>)'s wronged him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) hates him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at moments,'' Alyosha thought to himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hoped that it was only <div class="bookquote">``at moments. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>In Katya's last words he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) detected a challenging note, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not take it up.
<p/>'' I sent for you this morning to make you promise to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) yourself. Or do you, too, consider that to escape would be dishonorable, cowardly, or something ... unchristian, perhaps?''
<p/>Katya added, even more defiantly. '' Oh, no. I'll tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) everything,'' muttered Alyosha. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asks you to come and see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to-day,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blurted out suddenly, looking her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) steadily in the face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) started, and drew back a little from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on the sofa. '' Me? Can that be? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) faltered, turning pale.
<p/>'' It can and ought to be!'' Alyosha began emphatically, growing more animated. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needs you particularly just now. I would not have opened the subject and worried you, if it were not necessary.
<p/>It is not to be reconciled with you that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants you, but only that you would go and show yourself at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) door.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is ill, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is beside himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) keeps asking for you. So much has happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) since that day.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not ask your forgiveness--`It's impossible to forgive me,' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says himself--but only that you would show yourself in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) doorway.''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) realizes that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has injured you beyond all reckoning. '' It's so sudden...'' faltered Katya. '' I've had a presentiment all these days that you would come with that message.
<p/>Only think, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) realizes for the first time how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has wounded you, the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never grasped it before so fully.
<p/>I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would ask me to come. It's impossible!'' <div class="bookquote">``Let it be impossible, but do it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, `If she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) refuses to come I shall be unhappy all my life.'
<p/>Do you hear? though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is condemned to penal servitude for twenty years, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is still planning to be happy--is not that piteous?
<p/>Think-- you must visit him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is ruined, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is innocent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>broke like a challenge from Alyosha.

''  (<font color='red'><b>Katya/KATYA</b></font>)</div>Katya said, with bitter reproach, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) burst into tears.
<p/>'' Then you will come,'' said Alyosha firmly, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) tears. '' I'll go and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) you will come directly.
<p/>'' '' No, don't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) so on any account,'' cried Katya in alarm. '' I will come, but don't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) beforehand, for perhaps I may go, but not go in....
<p/>I don't know yet-- '' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) voice failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) gasped for breath. Alyosha got up to go. '' And what if I meet any one?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) said suddenly, in a low voice, turning white again. '' That's just why you must go now, to avoid meeting any one.
<p/>There will be no one there, I can tell you that for certain. We will expect you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) concluded emphatically, and went out of the room.
<p/>The day after his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) fate was determined, Mitya had fallen ill with nervous fever, and was sent to the prison division of the town hospital.
<p/>But at the request of several persons -LRB-Alyosha, Madame Hohlakov, Lise, etc.-RRB-, Doctor Varvinsky had put Mitya not with other prisoners, but in a separate little room, the one where Smerdyakov had been.
<p/>It is true that there was a sentinel at the other end of the corridor, and there was a grating over the window, so that Varvinsky could be at ease about the indulgence he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had shown, which was not quite legal, indeed; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was a kind-hearted and compassionate young man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) knew how hard it would be for a man like Mitya to pass at once so suddenly into the society of robbers and murderers, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) must get used to it by degrees.
<p/>Chapter II. For A Moment The Lie Becomes Truth He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) hurried to the hospital where Mitya was lying now. The visits of relations and friends were informally sanctioned by the doctor and overseer, and even by the police captain.
<p/>But only Alyosha and Grushenka had visited Mitya. Rakitin had tried to force his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) way in twice, but Mitya persistently begged Varvinsky not to admit him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>Alyosha found him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) sitting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) bed in a hospital dressing-gown, rather feverish, with a towel, soaked in vinegar and water, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) head.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) looked at Alyosha as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) came in with an undefined expression, but there was a shade of something like dread discernible in it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had become terribly preoccupied since the trial; sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would be silent for half an hour together, and seemed to be pondering something heavily and painfully, oblivious of everything about him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>).
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) roused himself from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) brooding and began to talk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) always spoke with a kind of abruptness and never of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) really wanted to say.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) looked sometimes with a face of suffering at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) seemed to be more at ease with Grushenka than with Alyosha.
<p/>It is true, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) scarcely spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) at all, but as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) came in, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) whole face lighted up with joy.
<p/>Alyosha sat down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) on the bed in silence. This time Mitya was waiting for Alyosha in suspense, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) did not dare ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) a question.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) felt it almost unthinkable that Katya would consent to come, and at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) felt that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) did not come, something inconceivable would happen.
<p/>Alyosha understood his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) feelings. '' Trifon Borissovitch,'' Mitya began nervously, <div class="bookquote">``has pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) whole inn to pieces, I am told. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)'s taken up the flooring, pulled apart the planks, split up all the gallery, I am told.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) is seeking treasure all the time--the fifteen hundred roubles which the prosecutor said I'd hidden there. He (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) began playing these tricks, they say, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) got home.
<p/>Serve him (<font color='blue'><b>prosecutor</b></font>) right, the swindler! The guard here told me yesterday; he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) comes from there.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Listen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>began Alyosha. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) will come, but I don't know when.
<p/>Perhaps to-day, perhaps in a few days, that I can't tell. But she (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) will come, she (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) will, that's certain. '' Mitya started, would have said something, but was silent.
<p/>It was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) would have liked terribly to know what had been said, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) was again afraid to ask.
<p/>The news had a tremendous effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>). Something cruel and contemptuous from Katya would have cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) like a knife at that moment.
<p/>This was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) said among other things; that I must be sure to set your conscience at rest about escaping.
<p/>'' If Ivan is not well by then she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) will see to it all herself.'' '' You've spoken of that already,'' Mitya observed musingly.
<p/>'' And you have repeated it to Grusha,'' observed Alyosha. '' Yes,'' Mitya admitted. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) won't come this morning. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) looked timidly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) brother. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) won't come till the evening. When I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) yesterday that Katya was taking measures, she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) was silent, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) set her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) only whispered, `Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>)!' She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) understood that it was important. I did not dare to try her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) further. She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) understands now, I think, that Katya no longer cares for me, but loves Ivan.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>broke from Alyosha. '' Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) does not. Only she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) is not coming this morning,'' Mitya hastened to explain again; <div class="bookquote">``I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) to do something for me.
<p/>You know, Ivan is superior to all of us. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) ought to live, not us. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) will recover.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Would you believe it, though Katya is alarmed about him (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) scarcely doubts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) recovery,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha.
<p/>'' That means that she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) is convinced he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) will die. It's because she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) is frightened she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>)'s so sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) will get well.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Ivan has a strong constitution, and I, too, believe there's every hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) will get well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha observed anxiously.
<p/>'' Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) will get well. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) is convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ivan</b></font>) will die. She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) has a great deal of sorrow to bear...
<p/>'' A silence followed. A grave anxiety was fretting Mitya. '' Alyosha, I love Grusha terribly,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) said suddenly in a shaking voice, full of tears.
<p/>'' They won't let her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) go out there to you,'' Alyosha put in at once. '' And there is something else I wanted to tell you,'' Mitya went on, with a sudden ring in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) voice.
<p/>'' If they beat me on the way or out there, I won't submit to it. I shall kill some one, and shall be shot for it.
<p/>And this will be going on for twenty years! They speak to me rudely as it is. I've been lying here all night, passing judgment on myself.
<p/>I wanted to sing a `hymn'; but if a guard speaks rudely to me, I have not the strength to bear it.
<p/>I am not ready! I am not able to resign myself. For Grusha I would bear anything ... anything except blows....
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) won't be allowed to come there. '' Alyosha smiled gently. '' Listen, brother, once for all,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) said. ''
<p/>This is what I think about it. And you know that I would not tell you a lie. Listen: you are not ready, and such a cross is not for you.
<p/>What's more, you don't need such a martyr's cross when you are not ready for it. If you had murdered our father, it would grieve me that you should reject your punishment.
<p/>But you are innocent, and such a cross is too much for you. You wanted to make yourself another man by suffering.
<p/>I say, only remember that other man always, all your life and wherever you go; and that will be enough for you.
<p/>Your refusal of that great cross will only serve to make you feel all your life an even greater duty, and that constant feeling will do more to make you a new man, perhaps, than if you went there.
<p/>For there you would not endure it and would repine, and perhaps at last would say: 'I am quits.' The lawyer was right about that.
<p/>Such heavy burdens are not for all men. For some they are impossible. These are my thoughts about it, if you want them so much.
<p/>If other men would have to answer for your escape, officers or soldiers, then I would not have `allowed' you,'' smiled Alyosha.
<p/>But they declare--the superintendent of that étape told Ivan himself--that if it's well managed there will be no great inquiry, and that they can get off easily.
<p/>Of course, bribing is dishonest even in such a case, but I can't undertake to judge about it, because if Ivan and Katya commissioned me to act for you, I know I should go and give bribes.
<p/>'' I must tell you the truth. And so I can't judge of your own action. But let me assure you that I shall never condemn you.
<p/>And it would be a strange thing if I could judge you in this. Now I think I've gone into everything.''
<p/>'' But I do condemn myself! '' cried Mitya. '' I shall escape, that was settled apart from you; could Mitya Karamazov do anything but run away?
<p/>But I shall condemn myself, and I will pray for my sin for ever. That's how the Jesuits talk, isn't it?
<p/>Just as we are doing?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha smiled gently. '' I love you for always telling the whole truth and never hiding anything,'' cried Mitya, with a joyful laugh.
<p/>'' So I've caught my Alyosha being Jesuitical. I must kiss you for that. Now listen to the rest; I'll open the other side of my heart to you.
<p/>If I run away, even with money and a passport, and even to America, I should be cheered up by the thought that I am not running away for pleasure, not for happiness, but to another exile as bad, perhaps, as Siberia.
<p/>This is what I planned and decided. It is as bad, Alyosha, it is! I hate that America, damn it, already.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is Russian, Russian to the marrow of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) bones; she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) will be homesick for the mother country, and I shall see every hour that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is suffering for my sake, that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has taken up that cross for me.
<p/>Even though Grusha will be with me. Just look at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>); is she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) an American? And what harm has she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) done?
<p/>And how shall I, too, put up with the rabble out there, though they may be better than I, every one of them?
<p/>I hate that America already! And though they may be wonderful at machinery, every one of them, damn them, they are not of my soul.
<p/>I love Russia, Alyosha, I love the Russian God, though I am a scoundrel myself. I shall choke there! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) exclaimed, his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) eyes suddenly flashing.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) voice was trembling with tears. '' So this is what I've decided, Alyosha, listen,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) began again, mastering his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) emotion.
<p/>As soon as I arrive there with Grusha, we will set to work at once on the land, in solitude, somewhere very remote, with wild bears.
<p/>'' There must be some remote parts even there. I am told there are still Redskins there, somewhere, on the edge of the horizon.
<p/>So to the country of the Last of the Mohicans , and there we'll tackle the grammar at once, Grusha and I. Work and grammar--that's how we'll spend three years.
<p/>And by that time we shall speak English like any Englishman. And as soon as we've learnt it--good-by to America! We'll run here to Russia as American citizens.
<p/>Don't be uneasy--we would not come to this little town. We'd hide somewhere, a long way off, in the north or in the south.
<p/>The doctors shall make me some sort of wart on my face--what's the use of their being so mechanical!--or else I'll put out one eye, let my beard grow a yard, and I shall turn gray, fretting for Russia.
<p/>I shall be changed by that time, and she (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) will, too, in America. I dare say they won't recognize us. And if they do, let them send us to Siberia.
<p/>We'll work on the land here, too, somewhere in the wilds, and I'll make up as an American all my life.
<p/>I don't care. It will show it's our fate. But we shall die on our own soil. That's my plan, and it shan't be altered.
<p/>Do you approve?'' '' Yes,'' said Alyosha, not wanting to contradict him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>). Mitya paused for a minute and said suddenly: <div class="bookquote">``And how they worked it up at the trial!
<p/>Didn't they work it up!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>'' If they had not, you would have been convicted just the same,'' said Alyosha, with a sigh.
<p/>'' Yes, people are sick of me here! God bless them, but it's hard,'' Mitya moaned miserably. Again there was silence for a minute.
<p/>'' Alyosha, put me out of my misery at once! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) exclaimed suddenly. '' Tell me, is she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) coming now, or not?
<p/>Tell me? What did she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) say? How did she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) say it?'' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) would come, but I don't know whether she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) will come to-day.
<p/>It's hard for her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), you know,'' Alyosha looked timidly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) brother. '' I should think it is hard for her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)!
<p/>Alyosha, it will drive me out of my mind. Grusha keeps looking at me. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) understands. My God, calm my heart: what is it
<p/>I want? I want Katya! Do I understand what I want? It's the headstrong, evil Karamazov spirit! No, I am not fit for suffering.
<p/>I am a scoundrel, that's all one can say. '' <div class="bookquote">``Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>cried Alyosha. At that instant Katya appeared in the doorway.
<p/>For a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) stood still, gazing at Mitya with a dazed expression. He (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) leapt impulsively to his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) feet, and a scared look came into his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) turned pale, but a timid, pleading smile appeared on his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) lips at once, and with an irresistible impulse he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) held out both hands to Katya.
<p/>Seeing it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) flew impetuously to him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) seized him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) by the hands, and almost by force made him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) sit down on the bed.
<p/>Several times they both strove to speak, but stopped short and again gazed speechless with a strange smile, their eyes fastened on one another.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) sat down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>), and still keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) hands pressed them violently. So passed two minutes. '' Have you forgiven me?''
<p/>Mitya faltered at last, and at the same moment turning to Alyosha, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face working with joy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``Do you hear what I am asking, do you hear?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>My forgiveness is no good to you, nor yours to me; whether you forgive me or not, you will always be a sore place in my heart, and
<p/>'' That's what I loved you for, that you are generous at heart!'' broke from Katya. '' I in yours --so it must be....
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) began again with nervous haste: <div class="bookquote">``to embrace your feet, to press your hands like this, till it hurts--you remember how in Moscow I used to squeeze them--to tell you again that you are my god, my joy, to tell you that I love you madly,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) moaned in anguish, and suddenly pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) hand greedily to her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) lips.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) stopped to take breath. '' What have I come for? '' Tears streamed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) eyes. Alyosha stood speechless and confounded; he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) had never expected what he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) was seeing.
<p/>'' Love is over, Mitya!'' Katya began again, <div class="bookquote">``but the past is painfully dear to me. Know that you will always be so.
<p/>But now let what might have been come true for one minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Katya/KATYA</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) faltered, with a drawn smile, looking into his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) face joyfully again.
<p/>You love another woman, and I love another man, and yet I shall love you for ever, and you will love me; do you know that?
<p/>'' Do you hear? Love me, love me all your life! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried, with a quiver almost of menace in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice.
<p/>'' I shall love you, and ... do you know, Katya,'' Mitya began, drawing a deep breath at each word, <div class="bookquote">``do you know,
<p/>five days ago, that same evening, I loved you.... When you fell down and were carried out ... All my life!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>So they murmured to one another frantic words, almost meaningless, perhaps not even true, but at that moment it was all true, and they both believed what they said implicitly.
<p/>So it will be, so it will always be-- '' Katya,'' cried Mitya suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``do you believe I murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>)? I know you don't believe it now, but then ... when you gave evidence....
<p/>Surely, surely you did not believe it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I did not believe it even then. I've never believed it. I hated you, and for a moment I persuaded myself.
<p/>While I was giving evidence I persuaded myself and believed it, but when I'd finished speaking I left off believing it at once.
<p/>I have forgotten that I came here to punish myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, with a new expression in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) voice, quite unlike the loving tones of a moment before.
<p/>Don't doubt that! '' Woman, yours is a heavy burden,'' broke, as it were, involuntarily from Mitya. <div class="bookquote">``Let me go,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) whispered.
<p/>'' I'll come again. It's more than I can bear now. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) was getting up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Woman</b></font>) place, but suddenly uttered a loud scream and staggered back.
<p/>Katya moved swiftly to the door, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) reached Grushenka, she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) stopped suddenly, turned as white as chalk and moaned softly, almost in a whisper: <div class="bookquote">``Forgive me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Grushenka stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) and, pausing for an instant, in a vindictive, venomous voice, answered: <div class="bookquote">``We are full of hatred, my girl, you and I!
<p/>Grushenka walked suddenly and noiselessly into the room. No one had expected her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). We are both full of hatred! As though we could forgive one another!
<p/>Save him (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>), and I'll worship you all my life.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You won't forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mitya/Samsonov/Kuzma</b></font>)</div>cried Mitya, with frantic reproach. '' Don't be anxious, I'll save him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) for you!''
<p/>Katya whispered rapidly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) ran out of the room. '' And you could refuse to forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) begged your forgiveness herself?''
<p/>Mitya exclaimed bitterly again. '' Mitya, don't dare to blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>); you have no right to!'' Alyosha cried hotly. '' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) proud lips spoke, not her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) heart,'' Grushenka brought out in a tone of disgust.
<p/>'' If she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) saves you I'll forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) everything-- '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) stopped speaking, as though suppressing something. She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) could not yet recover herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) had come in, as appeared afterwards, accidentally, with no suspicion of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) would meet. '' Alyosha, run after her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>)!''
<p/>Mitya cried to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) brother; <div class="bookquote">``tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) ... I don't know ... don't let her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) go away like this!''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll come to you again at nightfall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) ran after Katya.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) overtook her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) outside the hospital grounds. She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) was walking fast, but as soon as Alyosha caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) up she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) said quickly:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, before that woman I can't punish myself! I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) forgiveness because I wanted to punish myself to the bitter end.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) would not forgive me.... I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) for that! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) added, in an unnatural voice, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) eyes flashed with fierce resentment.
<p/>'' My brother did not expect this in the least,'' muttered Alyosha. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) would not come-- '' <div class="bookquote">``No doubt.
<p/>Let us leave that,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Katya</b></font>) snapped. <div class="bookquote">``Listen: I can't go with you to the funeral now. I've sent them flowers. I think they still have money.
<p/>If necessary, tell them I'll never abandon them.... Now leave me, leave me, please. You are late as it is--the bells are ringing for the service....
<p/>They had waited for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) and had already decided to bear the pretty flower-decked little coffin to the church without him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
<p/>Leave me, please!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Chapter III. Ilusha's Funeral. The Speech At The Stone He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) really was late. It was the coffin of poor little Ilusha.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had died two days after Mitya was sentenced. At the gate of the house Alyosha was met by the shouts of the boys, Ilusha's schoolfellows.
<p/>They had all been impatiently expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) and were glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mitya</b></font>) had come at last. There were about twelve of them, they all had their school-bags or satchels on their shoulders.
<p/>'' Father will cry, be with father,'' Ilusha had told them as he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) lay dying, and the boys remembered it. Kolya Krassotkin was the foremost of them.
<p/>'' How glad I am you've come, Karamazov! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) cried, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hand to Alyosha. '' It's awful here.
<p/>Snegiryov is not drunk, we know for a fact he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>)'s had nothing to drink to-day, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) seems as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) were drunk ...
<p/>It's really horrible to see it. I am always manly, but this is awful. Karamazov, if I am not keeping you, one question before you go in?''
<p/>'' What is it, Kolya?'' said Alyosha. '' Is your brother innocent or guilty? Was it he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) killed your father or was it the valet?
<p/>As you say, so it will be. I haven't slept for the last four nights for thinking of it.'' '' The valet killed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), my brother is innocent,'' answered Alyosha.
<p/>'' That's what I said,'' cried Smurov. '' So he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will perish an innocent victim! '' exclaimed Kolya; <div class="bookquote">``though he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is ruined he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is happy!
<p/>I could envy him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>'' What do you mean? How can you? Why? '' cried Alyosha surprised. '' Oh, if I, too, could sacrifice myself some day for truth!'' said Kolya with enthusiasm.
<p/>Of course ... I should like to die for all humanity, and as for disgrace, I don't care about that--our names may perish.
<p/>'' But not in such a cause, not with such disgrace and such horror!'' said Alyosha. '' I respect your brother!''
<p/>the boy, who had once declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew who had founded Troy, cried suddenly and unexpectedly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) blushed up to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ears like a peony as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had done on that occasion.
<p/>'' And so do I!'' Alyosha went into the room. Ilusha lay with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands folded and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes closed in a blue coffin with a white frill round it.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thin face was hardly changed at all, and strange to say there was no smell of decay from the corpse.
<p/>The expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face was serious and, as it were, thoughtful. His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands, crossed over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) breast, looked particularly beautiful, as though chiseled in marble.
<p/>There were flowers in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands and the coffin, inside and out, was decked with flowers, which had been sent early in the morning by Lise Hohlakov.
<p/>But there were flowers too from Katerina Ivanovna, and when Alyosha opened the door, the captain had a bunch in his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) trembling hands and was strewing them again over his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) dear boy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) scarcely glanced at Alyosha when he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) came in, and he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) would not look at any one, even at his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) crazy weeping wife, <div class="bookquote">``mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife mamma</b></font>)</div>who kept trying to stand on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) crippled legs to get a nearer look at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dead boy.
<p/>Nina had been pushed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) chair by the boys close up to the coffin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) head pressed to it
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) too was no doubt quietly weeping. Snegiryov's face looked eager, yet bewildered and exasperated. There was something crazy about his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gestures and the words that broke from him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>'' Old man, dear old man! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exclaimed every minute, gazing at Ilusha. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) habit to call Ilusha <div class="bookquote">``old man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ilusha</b></font>)</div>as a term of affection when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was alive.
<p/>Father, give me a flower, too; take that white one out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hand and give it me,'' the crazy mother begged, whimpering.
<p/>Either because the little white rose in Ilusha's hand had caught her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fancy or that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wanted one from his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) hand to keep in memory of him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) moved restlessly, stretching out her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands for the flower.
<p/>'' '' I won't give it to any one, I won't give you anything,'' Snegiryov cried callously. '' They are his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) flowers, not yours!
<p/>Everything is his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), nothing is yours!'' <div class="bookquote">``Father, give mother a flower!''  (<font color='red'><b>Nina</b></font>)</div>said Nina, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) face wet with tears. '' I won't give away anything and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) less than any one!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) took away his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) little cannon and he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) gave it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>),'' the captain broke into loud sobs at the thought of how Ilusha had given up his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) cannon to his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) mother.
<p/>The boys, seeing that the father would not leave the coffin and that it was time to carry it out, stood round it in a close circle and began to lift it up.
<p/>I don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to be buried in the churchyard,'' Snegiryov wailed suddenly; <div class="bookquote">``I'll bury him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) by the stone, by our stone!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't love Ilusha. The poor, crazy creature was bathed in noiseless tears, hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Snegiryov</b></font>)</div>Ilusha told me to.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been saying for the last three days that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would bury him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) by the stone, but Alyosha, Krassotkin, the landlady, her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) sister and all the boys interfered.
<p/>I won't let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) be carried out! '' '' What an idea, bury him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) by an unholy stone, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had hanged himself!''
<p/>One can hear the singing in church and the deacon reads so plainly and verbally that it will reach him (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) every time just as though it were read over his (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) grave.
<p/>the old landlady said sternly. '' There in the churchyard the ground has been crossed. He (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>)'ll be prayed for there. ''
<p/>The boys raised the coffin, but as they passed the mother, they stopped for a moment and lowered it that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might say good- by to Ilusha.
<p/>But on seeing that precious little face, which for the last three days she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had only looked at from a distance, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) trembled all over and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gray head began twitching spasmodically over the coffin.
<p/>At last the captain made a gesture of despair as though to say, <div class="bookquote">``Take him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) where you will. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the captain</b></font>)</div>'' Mother, make the sign of the cross over him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), give him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) your blessing, kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>),'' Nina cried to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>).
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) head still twitched like an automaton and with a face contorted with bitter grief she (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) began, without a word, beating her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) breast with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) fist.
<p/>They carried the coffin past her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>). Nina pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) lips to her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>) brother's for the last time as they bore the coffin by her (<font color='blue'><b>Nina</b></font>).
<p/>As Alyosha went out of the house he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) begged the landlady to look after those who were left behind, but she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had finished.
<p/>'' To be sure, I'll stay with them, we are Christians, too. '' The old woman wept as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said it.
<p/>They had not far to carry the coffin to the church, not more than three hundred paces. It was a still, clear day, with a slight frost.
<p/>Snegiryov ran fussing and distracted after the coffin, in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) short old summer overcoat, with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) head bare and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) soft, old, wide-brimmed hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand.
<p/>At one minute he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hand to support the head of the coffin and only hindered the bearers, at another he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ran alongside and tried to find a place for himself there.
<p/>A flower fell on the snow and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) rushed to pick it up as though everything in the world depended on the loss of that flower.
<p/>The church bells were still ringing. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) seemed in a state of bewildered anxiety. '' And the crust of bread, we've forgotten the crust!''
<p/>But the boys reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had taken the crust of bread already and that it was in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cried suddenly in dismay. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) instantly pulled it out and was reassured. '' Ilusha told me to, Ilusha,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) explained at once to Alyosha.
<p/>I was sitting by him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) one night and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) suddenly told me: `Father, when my grave is filled up crumble a piece of bread on it so that the sparrows may fly down, I shall hear and it will cheer me up not to be lying alone.'
<p/>'' '' '' That's a good thing,'' said Alyosha, <div class="bookquote">``we must often take some.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>'' Every day, every day!'' said the captain quickly, seeming cheered at the thought.
<p/>They reached the church at last and set the coffin in the middle of it. The boys surrounded it and remained reverently standing so, all through the service.
<p/>It was an old and rather poor church; many of the ikons were without settings; but such churches are the best for praying in.
<p/>During the mass Snegiryov became somewhat calmer, though at times he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had outbursts of the same unconscious and, as it were, incoherent anxiety.
<p/>At one moment he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) went up to the coffin to set straight the cover or the wreath, when a candle fell out of the candlestick he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) rushed to replace it and was a fearful time fumbling over it, then he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) subsided and stood quietly by the coffin with a look of blank uneasiness and perplexity.
<p/>After the Epistle he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) suddenly whispered to Alyosha, who was standing beside him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>), that the Epistle had not been read properly but did not explain what he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) meant.
<p/>During the prayer, <div class="bookquote">``Like the Cherubim,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) joined in the singing but did not go on to the end. Falling on his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) knees, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) forehead to the stone floor and lay so for a long while.
<p/>At last came the funeral service itself and candles were distributed. The distracted father began fussing about again, but the touching and impressive funeral prayers moved and roused his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) soul.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seemed suddenly to shrink together and broke into rapid, short sobs, which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tried at first to smother, but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sobbed aloud.
<p/>When they began taking leave of the dead and closing the coffin, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) flung his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arms about, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not allow them to cover Ilusha, and began greedily and persistently kissing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dead boy on the lips.
<p/>At last they succeeded in persuading him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to come away from the step, but suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) impulsively stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand and snatched a few flowers from the coffin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked at them and a new idea seemed to dawn upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), so that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) apparently forgot his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grief for a minute.
<p/>Gradually he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seemed to sink into brooding and did not resist when the coffin was lifted up and carried to the grave.
<p/>It was an expensive one in the churchyard close to the church, Katerina Ivanovna had paid for it. After the customary rites the grave- diggers lowered the coffin.
<p/>Snegiryov with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) flowers in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands bent down so low over the open grave that the boys caught hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) coat in alarm and pulled him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) back.
<p/>When they began filling up the grave, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) suddenly pointed anxiously at the falling earth and began trying to say something, but no one could make out what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) meant, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stopped suddenly.
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was awfully excited, snatched up the bread and began pulling it to pieces and flinging the morsels on the grave.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not seem to understand fully what was happening. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was reminded that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must crumble the bread <div class="bookquote">``Come, fly down, birds, fly down, sparrows!
<p/>One of the boys observed that it was awkward for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to crumble the bread with the flowers in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands and suggested he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should give them to some one to hold for a time.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not do this and seemed indeed suddenly alarmed for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) flowers, as though they wanted to take them from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) altogether.
<p/>And after looking at the grave, and as it were, satisfying himself that everything had been done and the bread had been crumbled, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) suddenly, to the surprise of every one, turned, quite composedly even, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) way homewards.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) muttered anxiously. But his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) steps became more and more hurried, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) almost ran. The boys and Alyosha kept up with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>'' The flowers are for mamma, the flowers are for mamma! I was unkind to mamma,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) began exclaiming suddenly. Some one called to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to put on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hat as it was cold.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) flung the hat in the snow as though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) were angry and kept repeating, <div class="bookquote">``I won't have the hat, I won't have the hat.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Smurov picked it up and carried it after him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). All the boys were crying, and Kolya and the boy who discovered about Troy most of all.
<p/>Though Smurov, with the captain's hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) hand, was crying bitterly too, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) managed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) ran, to snatch up a piece of red brick that lay on the snow of the path, to fling it at the flock of sparrows that was flying by.
<p/>Half-way, Snegiryov suddenly stopped, stood still for half a minute, as though struck by something, and suddenly turning back to the church, ran towards the deserted grave.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) missed them, of course, and went on crying as he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) ran. But the boys instantly overtook him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) and caught hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) on all sides.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) fell helpless on the snow as though he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) had been knocked down, and struggling, sobbing, and wailing, he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) began crying out, <div class="bookquote">``Ilusha, old man, dear old man!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Alyosha and Kolya tried to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) get up, soothing and persuading him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' Captain, give over, a brave man must show fortitude,'' muttered Kolya.
<p/>You'll spoil the flowers,'' said Alyosha, ``and mamma is expecting them, she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is sitting crying because you would not give her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) any before.
<p/>Snegiryov suddenly recollected, <div class="bookquote">``they'll take away the bed, they'll take it away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Snegiryov</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added as though alarmed that they really would.
<p/>'' Ilusha's little bed is still there-- '' '' Yes, yes, mamma! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jumped up and ran homewards again. But it was not far off and they all arrived together.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, poor crippled darling, Ilusha has sent you these flowers,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, holding out to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a little bunch of flowers that had been frozen and broken while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was struggling in the snow.
<p/>But at that instant he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw in the corner, by the little bed, Ilusha's little boots, which the landlady had put tidily side by side.
<p/>Seeing the old, patched, rusty- looking, stiff boots he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flung up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands and rushed to them, fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees, snatched up one boot and, pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips to it, began kissing it greedily, crying, <div class="bookquote">``Ilusha, old man, dear old man, where are your little feet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Snegiryov opened the door hurriedly and called to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had so cruelly quarreled just before: <div class="bookquote">``Where have you taken him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) away?
<p/>Where have you taken him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the lunatic cried in a heartrending voice. Nina, too, broke into sobs. Kolya ran out of the room, the boys followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>At last Alyosha too went out. '' Let them weep,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to Kolya, <div class="bookquote">``it's no use trying to comfort them just now.
<p/>Do you know, Karamazov,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice so that no one could hear them, <div class="bookquote">``I feel dreadfully sad, and if it were only possible to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back, I'd give anything in the world to do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Let us wait a minute and then go back.'' '' No, it's no use, it's awful,'' Kolya assented. '' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, so would I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha.
<p/>'' What do you think, Karamazov? Had we better come back here to-night? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll be drunk, you know. '' <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will.
<p/>Let us come together, you and I, that will be enough, to spend an hour with them, with the mother and Nina.
<p/>If we all come together we shall remind them of everything again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>Alyosha suggested. '' The landlady is laying the table for them now
<p/>--there'll be a funeral dinner or something , the priest is coming; shall we go back to it, Karamazov?'' <div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alyosha/Karamazov/Alyosha Karamazov</b></font>)</div>said Alyosha.
<p/>'' It's all so strange, Karamazov, such sorrow and then pancakes after it, it all seems so unnatural in our religion.''
<p/>'' They are going to have salmon, too,'' the boy who had discovered about Troy observed in a loud voice. ''
<p/>I beg you most earnestly, Kartashov, not to interrupt again with your idiotic remarks, especially when one is not talking to you and doesn't care to know whether you exist or not!''
<p/>Meantime they were strolling slowly along the path and suddenly Smurov exclaimed: <div class="bookquote">``There's Ilusha's stone, under which they wanted to bury him (<font color='blue'><b>Troy</b></font>).
<p/>Kolya snapped out irritably. The boy flushed crimson but did not dare to reply. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Smurov</b></font>)</div>They all stood still by the big stone.
<p/>Alyosha looked and the whole picture of what Snegiryov had described to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that day, how Ilusha, weeping and hugging his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father, had cried, <div class="bookquote">``Father, father, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) insulted you,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>rose at once before his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) imagination.
<p/>With a serious and earnest expression he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) looked from one to another of the bright, pleasant faces of Ilusha's schoolfellows, and suddenly said to them: <div class="bookquote">``Boys, I should like to say one word to you, here at this place.
<p/>A sudden impulse seemed to come into his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) soul. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ilusha schoolfellows</b></font>)</div>The boys stood round him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) and at once bent attentive and expectant eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>).
<p/>I shall be for some time with my two brothers, of whom one is going to Siberia and the other is lying at death's door.
<p/>'' Boys, we shall soon part. But soon I shall leave this town, perhaps for a long time, so we shall part.
<p/>And whatever happens to us later in life, if we don't meet for twenty years afterwards, let us always remember how we buried the poor boy at whom we once threw stones, do you remember, by the bridge?
<p/>Let us make a compact here, at Ilusha's stone, that we will never forget Ilusha and one another. and afterwards we all grew so fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a fine boy, a kind-hearted, brave boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) felt for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father's honor and resented the cruel insult to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and stood up for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>And even if we are occupied with most important things, if we attain to honor or fall into great misfortune--still let us remember how good it was once here, when we were all together, united by a good and kind feeling which made us, for the time we were loving that poor boy, better perhaps than we are.
<p/>My little doves--let me call you so, for you are very like them, those pretty blue birds, at this minute as I look at your good dear faces.
<p/>My dear children, perhaps you won't understand what I am saying to you, because I often speak very unintelligibly, but you'll remember it all the same and will agree with my words some time.
<p/>You must know that there is nothing higher and stronger and more wholesome and good for life in the future than some good memory, especially a memory of childhood, of home.
<p/>People talk to you a great deal about your education, but some good, sacred memory, preserved from childhood, is perhaps the best education.
<p/>If a man carries many such memories with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into life, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is safe to the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) days, and if one has only one good memory left in one's heart, even that may sometime be the means of saving us.
<p/>Perhaps we may even grow wicked later on, may be unable to refrain from a bad action, may laugh at men's tears and at those people who say as Kolya did just now, 'I want to suffer for all men,' and may even jeer spitefully at such people.
<p/>But however bad we may become--which God forbid--yet, when we recall how we buried Ilusha, how we loved him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) last days, and how we have been talking like friends all together, at this stone, the cruelest and most mocking of us--if we do become so--will not dare to laugh inwardly at having been kind and good at this moment!
<p/>What's more, perhaps, that one memory may keep him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) from great evil and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will reflect and say, `Yes, I was good and brave and honest then!'
<p/>And so in the first place, we will remember him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), boys, all our lives. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) laugh to himself, that's no matter, a man often laughs at what's good and kind.
<p/>But I assure you, boys, that as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laughs he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will say at once in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart, `No, I do wrong to laugh, for that's not a thing to laugh at.' ''
<p/>The boys were excited and they, too, wanted to say something, but they restrained themselves, looking with intentness and emotion at the speaker.
<p/>I say this in case we become bad,'' Alyosha went on, ``but there's no reason why we should become bad, is there, boys?
<p/>That's only from thoughtlessness. <div class="bookquote">``That will be so , I understand you, Karamazov!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>cried Kolya, with flashing eyes. '' Let us be, first and above all, kind, then honest and then let us never forget each other!
<p/>I say that again. I give you my word for my part that I'll never forget one of you. Every face looking at me now I shall remember even for thirty years.
<p/>But I cannot forget that Kartashov exists and that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is not blushing now as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) discovered the founders of Troy, but is looking at me with his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) jolly, kind, dear little eyes.
<p/>Boys, my dear boys, let us all be generous and brave like Ilusha, clever, brave and generous like Kolya -LRB-though he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will be ever so much cleverer when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is grown up-RRB-, and let us all be as modest, as clever and sweet as Kartashov.
<p/>Just now Kolya said to Kartashov that we did not care to know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) exists or not. But why am I talking about those two?
<p/>You are all dear to me, boys, from this day forth, I have a place in my heart for you all, and I beg you to keep a place in your hearts for me!
<p/>Well, and who has united us in this kind, good feeling which we shall remember and intend to remember all our lives?
<p/>Who, if not Ilusha, the good boy, the dear boy, precious to us for ever! Let us never forget him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). May his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) memory live for ever in our hearts from this time forth!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us remember his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) clothes and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) poor little boots, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) coffin and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) unhappy, sinful father, and how boldly he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stood up for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) alone against the whole school.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes, yes, for ever, for ever! '' the boys cried in their ringing voices, with softened faces. <div class="bookquote">``We will remember, we will remember,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>cried the boys.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was brave, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was good!'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, how I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Kolya. '' Ah, children, ah, dear friends, don't be afraid of life!
<p/>How good life is when one does something good and just!'' '' Yes, yes,'' the boys repeated enthusiastically. '' Karamazov, we love you!''
<p/>a voice, probably Kartashov's, cried impulsively. '' We love you, we love you! '' they all caught it up. There were tears in the eyes of many of them.
<p/>'' Hurrah for Karamazov!'' Kolya shouted ecstatically. '' And may the dead boy's memory live for ever!'' Alyosha added again with feeling.
<p/>Karamazov,'' cried Kolya, <div class="bookquote">``can it be true what's taught us in religion, that we shall all rise again from the dead and shall live and see each other again, all, Ilusha too?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kolya/Krassotkin/Kolya Krassotkin</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly we shall all rise again, certainly we shall see each other and shall tell each other with joy and gladness all that has happened!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' For ever! '' the boys chimed in again. '' Alyosha answered, half laughing, half enthusiastic. '' Ah, how splendid it will be!'' broke from Kolya.
<p/>'' Well, now we will finish talking and go to his (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>) funeral dinner. Don't be put out at our eating pancakes--it's a very old custom and there's something nice in that!
<p/>'' laughed Alyosha. '' Well, let us go! And now we go hand in hand.'' '' And always so, all our lives hand in hand!
<p/>Hurrah for Karamazov!'' Kolya cried once more rapturously, and once more the boys took up his (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>) exclamation: <div class="bookquote">``Hurrah for Karamazov!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>THE END FOOTNOTES 1
