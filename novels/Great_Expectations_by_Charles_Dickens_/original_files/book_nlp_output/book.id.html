<p/>I My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip.
<p/>So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip. I give Pirrip as my father's family name, on the authority of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pirrip</b></font>) tombstone and my sister,--Mrs.
<p/>As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of either of them -LRB-for their days were long before the days of photographs-RRB-, my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones.
<p/>The shape of the letters on my father's, gave me an odd idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a square, stout, dark man, with curly black hair.
<p/>From the character and turn of the inscription, <div class="bookquote">``Also Georgiana Wife of the Above,''  (<font color='red'><b>the character turn</b></font>)</div>I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly.
<p/>To five little stone lozenges, each about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine,--who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that universal struggle,--I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state of existence.
<p/>Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith. Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river wound, twenty miles of the sea.
<p/>My first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening.
<p/>At such a time I found out for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also Georgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander, Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the aforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates, with scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low leaden line beyond was the river; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.
<p/>Hold your noise!'' cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch.
<p/>'' '' Keep still, you little devil, or I'll cut your throat!'' A fearful man, all in coarse gray, with a great iron on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg.
<p/>A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose teeth chattered in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seized me by the chin.
<p/>A man with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. '' Oh! Don't cut my throat, sir,'' I pleaded in terror.
<p/>'' Pray don't do it, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Tell us your name!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. '' Quick!'' <div class="bookquote">``Pip, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Once more,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, staring at me.
<p/>'' Give it mouth!'' <div class="bookquote">``Pip. Pip, sir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Show us where you live,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. '' Pint out the place!''
<p/>I pointed to where our village lay, on the flat in-shore among the alder-trees and pollards, a mile or more from the church.
<p/>The man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and emptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so sudden and strong that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my feet,--when the church came to itself
<p/>When the church came to itself,--for , I say, I was seated on a high tombstone, trembling while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ate the bread ravenously.
<p/>'' You young dog,'' said the man, licking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips, <div class="bookquote">``what fat cheeks you ha' got. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>I believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my years, and not strong.
<p/>Darn me if I couldn't eat em,'' said the man, with a threatening shake of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``and if I han't half a mind to`t!
<p/>I earnestly expressed my hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't, and held tighter to the tombstone on which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it; partly, to keep myself from crying.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>'' '' Now lookee here!'' said the man. '' Where's your mother?'' '' There, sir!'' said I. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>'' There, sir!'' I timidly explained. '' Also Georgiana. That's my mother. '' <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), coming back. '' And is that your father alonger your mother?''
<p/>'' Yes, sir,'' said I; <div class="bookquote">``him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too; late of this parish.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) muttered then, considering. '' Who d'ye live with,--supposin' you're kindly let to live, which I han't made up my mind about?''
<p/>'' My sister, sir,--Mrs. Joe Gargery,--wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Blacksmith, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>). And looked down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) leg.
<p/>After darkly looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) leg and me several times, he (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) came closer to my tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) could hold me; so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) eyes looked most powerfully down into mine, and mine looked most helplessly up into his (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>).
<p/>'' Now lookee here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the question being whether you're to be let to live. You know what a file is?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>After each question he (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a greater sense of helplessness and danger.
<p/>'' Yes, sir.'' '' And you know what wittles is?'' '' Yes, sir.'' '' You get me a file. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) tilted me again.
<p/>'' And you get me wittles. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) tilted me again. '' You bring 'em both to me. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) tilted me again.
<p/>I was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) with both hands, and said, <div class="bookquote">``If you would kindly please to let me keep upright, sir, perhaps I shouldn't be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Or I'll have your heart and liver out. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) tilted me again. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped over its own weathercock.
<p/>Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Blacksmith</b></font>) held me by the arms, in an upright position on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You bring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder.
<p/>You do it, and you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having seen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shall be let to live.
<p/>You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, no matter how small it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore out, roasted, and ate.
<p/>Now, I ain't alone, as you may think I am. There's a young man hid with me, in comparison with which young man I am a Angel.
<p/>That young man has a secret way pecooliar to himself, of getting at a boy, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heart, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) liver.
<p/>That young man hears the words I speak. It is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young man.
<p/>A boy may lock his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) door, may be warm in bed, may tuck himself up, may draw the clothes over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head, may think himself comfortable and safe, but that young man will softly creep and creep his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and tear him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) open.
<p/>I am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present moment, with great difficulty. I find it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside.
<p/>I said that I would get him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the file, and I would get him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) what broken bits of food I could, and I would come to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at the Battery, early in the morning.
<p/>Now, what do you say? ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Say Lord strike you dead if you don't!'' said the man. I said so, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took me down.
<p/>'' Now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``you remember what you've undertook, and you remember that young man, and you get home!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Goo-good night, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I faltered.
<p/>'' Much of that!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), glancing about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) over the cold wet flat. '' I wish I was a frog.
<p/>At the same time, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hugged his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shuddering body in both his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms,--clasping himself, as if to hold himself together,--and limped towards the low church wall.
<p/>As I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go, picking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way among the nettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked in my young eyes as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were eluding the hands of the dead people, stretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ankle and pull him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to the low church wall, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got over it, like a man whose legs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me.
<p/>Or a eel!'' When I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use of my legs.
<p/>But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) going on again towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, and picking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sore feet among the great stones dropped into the marshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains were heavy or the tide was in.
<p/>The marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped to look after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and the river was just another horizontal line, not nearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed.
<p/>On the edge of the river I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the prospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was the beacon by which the sailors steered,--like an unhooped cask upon a pole,--an ugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, with some chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate.
<p/>The man was limping on towards this latter, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were the pirate come to life, and come down, and going back to hook himself up again.
<p/>It gave me a terrible turn when I thought so; and as I saw the cattle lifting their heads to gaze after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I wondered whether they thought so too.
<p/>I looked all round for the horrible young man, and could see no signs of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But now I was frightened again, and ran home without stopping.
<p/>My sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I, and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbors because she (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) had brought me up <div class="bookquote">``by hand.
<p/>Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) to have a hard and heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) husband as well as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a general impression that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) must have made Joe Gargery marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) by hand.
<p/>Joe was a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smooth face, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to have somehow got mixed with their own whites.
<p/>Chapter II ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a mild, good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,--a sort of Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.
<p/>My sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was tall and bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) figure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in front, that was stuck full of pins and needles.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) made it a powerful merit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wore this apron so much.
<p/>Though I really see no reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) should have worn it at all; or why, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) did wear it at all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) should not have taken it off, every day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) life.
<p/>Joe's forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of the dwellings in our country were,--most of them, at that time.
<p/>Joe and I being fellow-sufferers, and having confidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the moment I raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) opposite to it, sitting in the chimney corner.
<p/>When I ran home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe was sitting alone in the kitchen. ''
<p/>Mrs. Joe has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'s out now, making it a baker's dozen.''
<p/>At this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round, and looked in great depression at the fire.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe; <div class="bookquote">``and what's worse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'s got Tickler with her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Tickler was a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) sot down,'' said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) got up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) made a grab at Tickler, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) Ram-paged out.
<p/>That's what she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at it; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) Ram-paged out, Pip.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) been gone long, Joe? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I always treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) as a larger species of child, and as no more than my equal.
<p/>Well,'' said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'s been on the Ram-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'s a coming! Get behind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you. '' I took the advice.
<p/>My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open, and finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause, and applied Tickler to its further investigation.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) concluded by throwing me--I often served as a connubial missile--at Joe, who, glad to get hold of me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) great leg.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me directly what you've been doing to wear me away with fret and fright and worrit, or I'd have you out of that corner if you was fifty Pips, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was five hundred Gargerys.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>monkey</b></font>)</div>Where have you been, you young monkey?'' said Mrs. Joe, stamping her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) foot. '' <div class="bookquote">``I have only been to the churchyard,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, from my stool, crying and rubbing myself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Churchyard!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>repeated my sister. '' If it warn't for me you'd have been to the churchyard long ago, and stayed there.
<p/>Who brought you up by hand?'' '' You did,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``And why did I do it, I should like to know?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>exclaimed my sister. I whimpered, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said my sister. '' I'd never do it again!
<p/>I know that. I may truly say I've never had this apron of mine off since born you were. It's bad enough to be a blacksmith's wife -LRB-and him (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) a Gargery-RRB- without being your mother.
<p/>For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, the mysterious young man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge
<p/>'' My thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately at the fire. I was under to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before me in the avenging coals.
<p/>'' Hah! '' said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) station. '' Churchyard, indeed! You may well say churchyard, you two.
<p/>You'll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you, one of these days, and O, a pr-r-recious pair you'd be without me!''
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at me over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were mentally casting me and himself up, and calculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under the grievous circumstances foreshadowed.
<p/>After that, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blue eyes, as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner always was at squally times.
<p/>'' One of us, by the by, had not said it at all. '' My sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us, that never varied.
<p/>First, with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) left hand she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) jammed the loaf hard and fast against her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) bib,--where it sometimes got a pin into it, and sometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) took some butter -LRB-not too much-RRB- on a knife and spread it on the loaf, in an apothecary kind of way, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) were making a plaster,--using both sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and moulding the butter off round the crust.
<p/>Then, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) gave the knife a final smart wipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a very thick round off the loaf: which she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) finally, before separating from the loaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.
<p/>I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful acquaintance, and his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) ally the still more dreadful young man.
<p/>I knew Mrs. Joe's housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe.
<p/>On the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my slice. Therefore I resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of my trousers.
<p/>It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap from the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.
<p/>The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I found to be quite awful. And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe.
<p/>In our already-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) good-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare the way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to each other's admiration now and then,--which stimulated us to new exertions.
<p/>To-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) fast diminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but he (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) found me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and my untouched bread and butter on the other.
<p/>At last, I desperately considered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it had best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the circumstances.
<p/>I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at me, and got my bread and butter down my leg.
<p/>Joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) supposed to be my loss of appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) slice, which he (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) didn't seem to enjoy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) turned it about in his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) mouth much longer than usual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like a pill.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) was about to take another bite, and had just got his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) head on one side for a good purchase on it, when his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) eye fell on me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) saw that my bread and butter was gone.
<p/>The wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold of his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sister's observation.
<p/>'' What's the matter now?'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), smartly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) cup. '' I say, you know! '' muttered Joe, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>hunk</b></font>) head at me in very serious remonstrance.
<p/>'' Pip, old chap! You'll do yourself a mischief. It'll stick somewhere. You can't have chawed it, Pip.'' '' What's the matter now?
<p/>'' repeated my sister, more sharply than before. '' If you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I'd recommend you to do it,'' said Joe, all aghast.
<p/>By this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) pounced on Joe, and, taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) by the two whiskers, knocked his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) head for a little while against the wall behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), while I sat in the corner, looking guiltily on.
<p/>'' Manners is manners, but still your elth's your elth. '' '' Now, perhaps you'll mention what's the matter,'' said my sister, out of breath, <div class="bookquote">``you staring great stuck pig.
<p/>You know, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said Joe, solemnly, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) last bite in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) cheek, and speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone, <div class="bookquote">``you and me is always friends, and I'd be the last to tell upon you, any time.
<p/>But such a--''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) chair and looked about the floor between us, and then again at me--<div class="bookquote">``such a most oncommon Bolt as that!''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Joe looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, and looked at me again. '' <div class="bookquote">``Been bolting his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) food, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>cried my sister.
<p/>You know, old chap,'' said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) bite still in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) cheek,
<p/>``I Bolted, myself, when I was your age--frequent--and as a boy I've been among a many Bolters; but I never see your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it's a mercy you ain't Bolted dead.
<p/>My sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, saying nothing more than the awful words, ``You come along and be dosed.
<p/>Some medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine medicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard; having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness.
<p/>At the best of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as a choice restorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling like a new fence.
<p/>On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater comfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) arm, as a boot would be held in a bootjack.
<p/>Joe got off with half a pint; but was made to swallow that -LRB-much to his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) disturbance, as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sat slowly munching and meditating before the fire-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``because he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had had a turn.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' Judging from myself, I should say he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) certainly had a turn afterwards, if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had had none before.
<p/>Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, in the case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with another secret burden down the leg of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) trousers, it is -LRB-as I can testify-RRB- a great punishment.
<p/>for I never thought of any of the housekeeping property as his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)--united to the necessity of always keeping one hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered about the kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind.
<p/>Then, as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard the voice outside, of the man with the iron on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg who had sworn me to secrecy, declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't and wouldn't starve until to-morrow, but must be fed now.
<p/>At other times, I thought, What if the young man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands in me should yield to a constitutional impatience, or should mistake the time, and should think himself accredited to my heart and liver to-night, instead of to-morrow!
<p/>The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe --I never thought I was going to rob Joe, If ever anybody's hair stood on end with terror, mine must have done so then.
<p/>It was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with a copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock.
<p/>I tried it with the load upon my leg -LRB-and that made me think afresh of the man with the load on HIS (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg-RRB-, and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread and butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable.
<p/>But, perhaps, nobody's ever did? Happily I slipped away, and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom. ''
<p/>'' said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final warm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed; <div class="bookquote">``was that great guns, Joe?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Hark! <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. '' There's another conwict off. '' '' What does that mean, Joe?'' said I. Mrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly, <div class="bookquote">``Escaped.
<p/>While Mrs. Joe sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) needlework, I put my mouth into the forms of saying to Joe,
<p/>Joe put his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer, that I could make out nothing of it
<p/>Escaped. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Administering the definition like Tar-water. <div class="bookquote">``What's a convict? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>but the single word <div class="bookquote">``Pip.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>'' There was a conwict off last night,'' said Joe, aloud, <div class="bookquote">``after sunset-gun.
<p/>Who's firing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Drat that boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>interposed my sister, frowning at me over her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) work, <div class="bookquote">``what a questioner he (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) is.
<p/>And they fired warning of him (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>). And now it appears they're firing warning of another. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Ask no questions, and you'll be told no lies.
<p/>It was not very polite to herself, I thought, to imply that I should be told lies by her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) even if I did ask questions.
<p/>At this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost pains to open his (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of a word that looked to me like <div class="bookquote">``sulks.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) never was polite unless there was company. '' Therefore, I naturally pointed to Mrs. Joe, and put my mouth into the form of saying, <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>But Joe wouldn't hear of that, at all, and again opened his (<font color='blue'><b>questioner</b></font>) mouth very wide, and shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it.
<p/>Mrs. Joe,'' said I, as a last resort, <div class="bookquote">``I should like to know--if you wouldn't much mind--where the firing comes from?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>But I could make nothing of the word. '' <div class="bookquote">``Lord bless the boy! ''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>exclaimed my sister, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) didn't quite mean that but rather the contrary.
<p/>'' From the Hulks!'' '' Oh-h! '' said I, looking at Joe. <div class="bookquote">``Hulks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, <div class="bookquote">``Well, I told you so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And please, what's Hulks?'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``That's the way with this boy! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>exclaimed my sister, pointing me out with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) needle and thread, and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) head at me.
<p/>'' Answer him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) one question, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'ll ask you a dozen directly. Hulks are prison-ships, right `cross th' meshes. '' We always used that name for marshes, in our country.
<p/>I wonder who's put into prison-ships, and why they're put there?'' said I, in a general way, and with quiet desperation.
<p/>'' It was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose. '' I tell you what, young fellow,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I didn't bring you up by hand to badger people's lives out.
<p/>People are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob, and forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by asking questions.
<p/>I was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went upstairs in the dark, with my head tingling,--from Mrs. Joe's thimble having played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) last words,--I felt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were handy for me.
<p/>It would be blame to me and not praise, if I had. Now, you get along to bed! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I was clearly on my way there.
<p/>Since that time, which is far enough away now, I have often thought that few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror.
<p/>I had begun by asking questions, and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe. No matter how unreasonable the terror, so that it be terror.
<p/>I was in mortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver; I was in mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg; I was in mortal terror of myself, from whom an awful promise had been extracted; I had no hope of deliverance through my all-powerful sister, who repulsed me at every turn; I am afraid to think of what I might have done on requirement, in the secrecy of my terror.
<p/>If I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself drifting down the river on a strong spring-tide, to the Hulks; a ghostly pirate calling out to me through a speaking-trumpet, as I passed the gibbet-station, that I had better come ashore and be hanged there at once, and not put it off.
<p/>I was afraid to sleep, even if I had been inclined, for I knew that at the first faint dawn of morning I must rob the pantry.
<p/>to have got one I must have struck it out of flint and steel, and have made a noise like the very pirate himself rattling his (<font color='blue'><b>pirate</b></font>) chains.
<p/>As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot with gray, I got up and went downstairs;
<p/>every board upon the way, and every crack in every board calling after me, <div class="bookquote">``Stop thief!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Get up, Mrs. Joe!''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>In the pantry, which was far more abundantly supplied than usual, owing to the season, I was very much alarmed by a hare hanging up by the heels, whom I rather thought I caught, when my back was half turned, winking.
<p/>I had no time for verification, no time for selection, no time for anything, for I had no time to spare.
<p/>I stole some bread, some rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat -LRB-which I tied up in my pocket-handkerchief with my last night's slice-RRB-, some brandy from a stone bottle -LRB-which I decanted into a glass bottle I had secretly used for making that intoxicating fluid, Spanish-liquorice-water, up in my room: diluting the stone bottle from a jug in the kitchen cupboard-RRB-, a meat bone with very little on it, and a beautiful round compact pork pie.
<p/>I was nearly going away without the pie, but I was tempted to mount upon a shelf, to look what it was that was put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner, and I found it was the pie, and I took it in the hope that it was not intended for early use, and would not be missed for some time.
<p/>There was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I unlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joe's tools.
<p/>Then I put the fastenings as I had found them, opened the door at which I had entered when I ran home last night, shut it, and ran for the misty marshes.
<p/>There was no doing it in the night, for there was no getting a light by easy friction then; Chapter III
<p/>I had seen the damp lying on the outside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there all night, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief.
<p/>Now, I saw the damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort of spiders' webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade.
<p/>On every rail and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was so thick, that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our village--a direction which they never accepted, for they never came there--was invisible to me until I was quite close under it.
<p/>Then, as I looked up at it, while it dripped, it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a phantom devoting me to the Hulks.
<p/>The mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes, so that instead of my running at everything, everything seemed to run at me.
<p/>The gates and dikes and banks came bursting at me through the mist, as if they cried as plainly as could be, ``A boy with somebody else's pork pie!
<p/>The cattle came upon me with like suddenness, staring out of their eyes, and steaming out of their nostrils, <div class="bookquote">``Halloa, young thief!''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>One black ox, with a white cravat on,--who even had to my awakened conscience something of a clerical air,--fixed me so obstinately with his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) eyes, and moved his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I moved round, that I blubbered out to him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't help it, sir!
<p/>It was a rimy morning, and very damp. This was very disagreeable to a guilty mind. Stop him (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>)! ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>It wasn't for myself
<p/>Upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) put down his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) head, blew a cloud of smoke out of his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) nose, and vanished with a kick-up of his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) hind-legs and a flourish of his (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) tail.
<p/>I couldn't warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed riveted, as the iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet.
<p/>I knew my way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had been down there on a Sunday with Joe, and
<p/>Joe, sitting on an old gun, had told me that when I was `prentice to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), regularly bound, we would have such Larks there!
<p/>However, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at last too far to the right, and consequently had to try back along the river-side, on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide out.
<p/>Making my way along here with all despatch, I had just crossed a ditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, and had just scrambled up the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the man sitting before me.
<p/>I took it!'' All this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast I went, His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back was towards me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms folded, and was nodding forward, heavy with sleep.
<p/>I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be more glad if I came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breakfast, in that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly and touched him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on the shoulder.
<p/>And yet this man was dressed in coarse gray, too, and had a great iron on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg, and was lame, and hoarse, and cold, and was everything that the other man was; except that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not the same face, and had a flat broad-brimmed low-crowned felt hat on.
<p/>All this I saw in a moment, for I had only a moment to see it in: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) swore an oath at me, made a hit at me,--it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself down, for it made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stumble,--and
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) instantly jumped up, and it was not the same man, but another man! then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran into the mist, stumbling twice as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went, and I lost him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' It's the young man! '' I thought, feeling my heart shoot as I identified him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I dare say I should have felt a pain in my liver, too, if I had known where it was.
<p/>I was soon at the Battery after that, and there was the right man,--hugging himself and limping to and fro, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never all night left off hugging and limping,--waiting for me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was awfully cold, to be sure. I half expected to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drop down before my face and die of deadly cold.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes looked so awfully hungry too, that when I handed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the file and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) laid it down on the grass, it occurred to me he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have tried to eat it, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not seen my bundle.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not turn me upside down this time to get at what I had, but left me right side upwards while I opened the bundle and emptied my pockets.
<p/>Brandy,'' said I. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was already handing mincemeat down his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throat in the most curious manner,--more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent hurry, than a man who was eating
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shivered all the while so violently, that it was quite as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth, without biting it off.
<p/>'' What's in the bottle, boy? '' said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). '' it,--but he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) left off to take some of the liquor. ''
<p/>I think you have got the ague,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``I'm much of your opinion, boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). '' It's bad about here,'' I told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>'' You've been lying out on the meshes, and they're dreadful aguish. Rheumatic too. '' <div class="bookquote">``I'll eat my breakfast afore they're the death of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>'' I'd do that, if I was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is over there, directly afterwards.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was gobbling mincemeat, meatbone, bread, cheese, and pork pie, all at once: staring distrustfully while he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did so at the mist all round us, and often stopping--even stopping his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) jaws--to listen.
<p/>Some real or fancied sound, some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the marsh, now gave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a start, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, suddenly,--
<p/>I'll beat the shivers so far, I'll bet you. '' <div class="bookquote">``You're not a deceiving imp? You brought no one with you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, sir! No!'' '' Nor giv' no one the office to follow you?'' <div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Well,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I believe you.
<p/>You'd be but a fierce young hound indeed, if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched warmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Something clicked in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) throat as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had works in him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) like a clock, and was going to strike. And he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) smeared his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ragged rough sleeve over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Pitying his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) desolation, and watching him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gradually settled down upon the pie, I made bold to say, <div class="bookquote">``I am glad you enjoy it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had often watched a large dog of ours eating his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) food; and I now noticed a decided similarity between the dog's way of eating, and the man's.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you speak?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I said I was glad you enjoyed it. '' <div class="bookquote">``Thankee, my boy. I do. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man took strong sharp sudden bites, just like the dog.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) swallowed, or rather snapped up, every mouthful, too soon and too fast; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked sideways here and there while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ate, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought there was danger in every direction of somebody's coming to take the pie away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was altogether too unsettled in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind over it, to appreciate it comfortably I thought, or to have anybody to dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), without making a chop with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jaws at the visitor.
<p/>I am afraid you won't leave any of it for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),'' said I, timidly; after a silence during which I had hesitated as to the politeness of making the remark.
<p/>In all of which particulars he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very like the dog. '' '' There's no more to be got where that came from.
<p/>'' It was the certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint. '' Leave any for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Who's him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?'' said my friend, stopping in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crunching of pie-crust.
<p/>'' The young man. That you spoke of. That was hid with you.'' '' Oh ah!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned, with something like a gruff laugh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I. The man stopped eating, and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and the greatest surprise.
<p/>'' Him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Yes, yes! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) don't want no wittles. '' '' Looked? When?'' <div class="bookquote">``Just now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, pointing; <div class="bookquote">``over there, where I found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nodding asleep, and thought it was you.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held me by the collar and stared at me so, that I began to think his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first idea about cutting my throat had revived.
<p/>Dressed like you, you know, only with a hat,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I explained, trembling; <div class="bookquote">``and--and'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--I was very anxious to put this delicately--<div class="bookquote">``and with--the same reason for wanting to borrow a file.
<p/>I wonder you shouldn't have been sure of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned, <div class="bookquote">``for we heard it up at home, and that's farther away, and we were shut in besides.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Didn't you hear the cannon last night?'' '' Then there was firing! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said to himself. '' ''
<p/>When a man's alone on these flats, with a light head and a light stomach, perishing of cold and want, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hears nothin' all night, but guns firing, and voices calling.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, see now!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' Hears? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees the soldiers, with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried afore, closing in round him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Hears his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) number called, hears himself challenged, hears the rattle of the muskets, hears the orders `Make ready! Present! Cover him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) steady, men!'
<p/>Why, if I see one pursuing party last night--coming up in order, Damn 'em, with their tramp, tramp--I see a hundred.
<p/>Why, I see the mist shake with the cannon, arter it was broad day,--But this man''; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had said all the rest, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had forgotten my being there; <div class="bookquote">``did you notice anything in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>and is laid hands on--and there's nothin'! And as to firing! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a badly bruised face,'' said I, recalling what I hardly knew I knew.
<p/>'' Not here?'' exclaimed the man, striking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left cheek mercilessly, with the flat of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. '' Yes, there!'' <div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crammed what little food was left, into the breast of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gray jacket. <div class="bookquote">``Show me the way he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went. I'll pull him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down, like a bloodhound.
<p/>I indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked up at it for an instant.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was down on the rank wet grass, filing at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) iron like a madman, and not minding me or minding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own leg, which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody, but which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file.
<p/>I was very much afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had worked himself into this fierce hurry, and I was likewise very much afraid of keeping away from home any longer.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) I must go, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took no notice, so I thought the best thing I could do was to slip off.
<p/>The last I saw of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head was bent over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knee and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was working hard at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fetter, muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg.
<p/>Curse this iron on my sore leg! Give us hold of the file, boy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The last I heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), I stopped in the mist to listen, and the file was still going.
<p/>Chapter IV I fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen, waiting to take me up. But not only was there no Constable there, but no discovery had yet been made of the robbery.
<p/>Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the house ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put upon the kitchen doorstep to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Constable</b></font>) out of the dust-pan,--an article into which his (<font color='blue'><b>Constable</b></font>) destiny always led him (<font color='blue'><b>Constable</b></font>), sooner or later, when my sister was vigorously reaping the floors of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) establishment.
<p/>'' And where the deuce ha' you been? '' was Mrs. Joe's Christmas salutation, when I and my conscience showed ourselves.
<p/>I said I had been down to hear the Carols. '' Ah! well! '' observed Mrs. Joe. '' You might ha' done worse.
<p/>Perhaps if I warn't a blacksmith's wife, and -LRB-what's the same thing-RRB- a slave with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) apron never off, I should have been to hear the Carols,'' said Mrs. Joe.
<p/>'' Not a doubt of that I thought. '' '' I'm rather partial to Carols, myself, and that's the best of reasons for my never hearing any.
<p/>Joe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had retired before us, drew the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) nose with a conciliatory air, when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>), and, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) eyes were withdrawn, secretly crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) two forefingers, and exhibited them to me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper.
<p/>This was so much her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) normal state, that Joe and I would often, for weeks together, be, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to their legs.
<p/>We were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled pork and greens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls.
<p/>A handsome mince-pie had been made yesterday morning -LRB-which accounted for the mincemeat not being missed-RRB-, and the pudding was already on the boil.
<p/>These extensive arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of breakfast; <div class="bookquote">``for I ain't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Joe,--<div class="bookquote">``I ain't a going to have no formal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I've got before me, I promise you!
<p/>So, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on a forced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps of milk and water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the dresser.
<p/>In the meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, and tacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one, and uncovered the little state parlor across the passage, which was never uncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of the year in a cool haze of silver paper, which even extended to the four little white crockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a black nose and a basket of flowers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) mouth, and each the counterpart of the other.
<p/>Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite art of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself.
<p/>My sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that is to say, Joe and I were going.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) working-clothes, Joe was a well-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) holiday clothes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.
<p/>Nothing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wore then fitted him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) or seemed to belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>); and everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wore then grazed him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>).
<p/>On the present festive occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) emerged from his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) room, when the blithe bells were going, the picture of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials.
<p/>As to me, I think my sister must have had some general idea that I was a young offender whom an Accoucheur Policeman had taken up -LRB-on my birthday-RRB- and delivered over to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), to be dealt with according to the outraged majesty of the law.
<p/>I was always treated as if I had insisted on being born in opposition to the dictates of reason, religion, and morality, and against the dissuading arguments of my best friends.
<p/>Even when I was taken to have a new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make them like a kind of Reformatory, and on no account to let me have the free use of my limbs.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>'' Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the same by their religion. Joe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle for compassionate minds.
<p/>The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs. Joe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had done.
<p/>Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the Church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the terrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment.
<p/>I conceived the idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman said, <div class="bookquote">``Ye are now to declare it!''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>would be the time for me to rise and propose a private conference in the vestry.
<p/>I am far from being sure that I might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to this extreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.
<p/>Mr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubble the wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook -LRB-Joe's uncle, but Mrs. Joe appropriated him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)-RRB-, who was a well-to-do cornchandler in the nearest town, and drove his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) own chaise-cart.
<p/>When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and Mrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked -LRB-it never was at any other time-RRB- for the company to enter by, and everything most splendid.
<p/>Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to what I underwent within. The dinner hour was half-past one. And still, not a word of the robbery.
<p/>Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a large shining bald forehead, had a deep voice which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) was uncommonly proud of; indeed it was understood among his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) acquaintance that if you could only give him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) would read the clergyman into fits; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) himself confessed that if the Church was <div class="bookquote">``thrown open,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>meaning to competition, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) would not despair of making his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) mark in it.
<p/>The time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings, and the company came. The Church not being <div class="bookquote">``thrown open,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) was, as I have said, our clerk.
<p/>verse,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) looked all round the congregation first, as much as to say, <div class="bookquote">``You have heard my friend overhead; oblige me with your opinion of this style!
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) punished the Amens tremendously; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) gave out the psalm,--always giving the whole ''  (<font color='red'><b>the congregation</b></font>)</div>I opened the door to the company,--making believe that it was a habit of ours to open that
<p/>door,--and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle, next to Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook.
<p/>Mrs. Joe,'' said Uncle Pumblechook, a large hard-breathing middle-aged slow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hair standing upright on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) head, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had just been all but choked, and had that moment come to, <div class="bookquote">``I have brought you as the compliments of the season--
<p/>N.B. I was not allowed to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) uncle, under the severest penalties. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherry wine--and I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of port wine.
<p/>Every Christmas Day he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) presented himself, as a profound novelty, with exactly the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumb-bells.
<p/>'' Every Christmas Day, Mrs. Joe replied, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) now replied, <div class="bookquote">``O, Un--cle Pum-ble--chook! This is kind!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Every Christmas Day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) retorted, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) now retorted, <div class="bookquote">``It's no more than your merits.
<p/>We dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts and oranges and apples to the parlor; which was a change very like Joe's change from his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) working-clothes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) Sunday dress.
<p/>My sister was uncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generally more gracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company.
<p/>I remember Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue, who held a conventionally juvenile position, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) had married Mr. Hubble,--I don't know at what remote
<p/>And now are you all bobbish, and how's Sixpennorth of halfpence? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>meaning me. period,--when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) was much younger than he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>).
<p/>I remember Mr Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered, stooping old man, of a sawdusty fragrance, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs extraordinarily wide apart: so that in my short days I always saw some miles of open country between them when I met him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coming up the lane.
<p/>Not because I was squeezed in at an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and the Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to speak -LRB-I didn't want to speak-RRB-, nor because I was regaled with the scaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure corners of pork of which the pig, when living, had had the least reason to be vain.
<p/>Among this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn't robbed the pantry, in a false position. No; I should not have minded that, if they would only have left me alone.
<p/>They seemed to think the opportunity lost, if they failed to point the conversation at me, every now and then, and stick the point into me.
<p/>I might have been an unfortunate little bull in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched up by these moral goads.
<p/>Mr. Wopsle said grace with theatrical declamation,--as it now appears to me, something like a religious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,--and ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.
<p/>But they wouldn't leave me alone. It began the moment we sat down to dinner. Upon which my sister fixed me with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) eye, and said, in a low reproachful voice, ``Do you hear that?
<p/>Mrs. Hubble shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) head, and contemplating me with a mournful presentiment that I should come to no good, asked, <div class="bookquote">``Why is it that the young are never grateful?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Be grateful.'' <div class="bookquote">``Especially,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, <div class="bookquote">``be grateful, boy, to them which brought you up by hand. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>This moral mystery seemed too much for the company until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, <div class="bookquote">``Naterally wicious.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hubble</b></font>)</div>Everybody then murmured <div class="bookquote">``True!''  (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div>and looked at me in a particularly unpleasant and personal manner. Joe's station and influence were something feebler -LRB-if possible-RRB- when there was company than when there was none.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) always aided and comforted me when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) could, in some way of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) own, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) always did so at dinner-time by giving me gravy, if there were any.
<p/>A little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon with some severity, and intimated--in the usual hypothetical case of the Church being <div class="bookquote">``thrown open'' (<font color='red'><b>Church</b></font>)</div>--what kind of sermon he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) would have given them.
<p/>After favoring them with some heads of that discourse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) remarked that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) considered the subject of the day's homily, ill chosen; which was the less excusable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) added, when there were so many subjects <div class="bookquote">``going about.''
 (<font color='red'><b>subjects</b></font>)</div><p/>There being plenty of gravy to-day, Joe spooned into my plate, at this point, about half a pint. <div class="bookquote">``True again,''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Pumblechook.
<p/>'' You've hit it, sir! Plenty of subjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon their tails.
<p/>That's what's wanted. A man needn't go far to find a subject, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s ready with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) salt-box. '' Mr. Pumblechook added, after a short interval of reflection, <div class="bookquote">``Look at Pork alone.
<p/>There's a subject! If you want a subject, look at Pork!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``True, sir. Many a moral for the young,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Wopsle,--and
<p/>I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) was going to lug me in, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) said it; <div class="bookquote">``might be deduced from that text. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``You listen to this,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said my sister to me, in a severe parenthesis.-RRB-
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Swine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) deepest voice, and pointing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) fork at my blushes, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) were mentioning my Christian name,--<div class="bookquote">``swine were the companions of the prodigal.
<p/>Joe gave me some more gravy. The gluttony of Swine is put before us, as an example to the young. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-I thought this pretty well in him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy.-RRB- ''
<p/>What is detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy.'' '' Or girl,'' suggested Mr. Hubble. '' Of course, or girl, Mr. Hubble,'' assented Mr. Wopsle, rather irritably, <div class="bookquote">``but there is no girl present.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Besides,'' said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, <div class="bookquote">``think what you've got to be grateful for. If you'd been born a Squeaker--''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was, if ever a child was,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said my sister, most emphatically.
<p/>Joe gave me some more gravy. '' Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker,'' said Mr. Pumblechook. '' If you had been born such, would you have been here now?
<p/>But I don't mean in that form, sir,'' returned Mr. Pumblechook, who had an objection to being interrupted; <div class="bookquote">``I mean, enjoying himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) elders and betters, and improving himself with their conversation, and rolling in the lap of luxury.
<p/>Not you--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>'' Unless in that form,'' said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish. '' Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) have been doing that?
<p/>You would have been disposed of for so many shillings according to the market price of the article, and Dunstable the butcher would have come up to you as you lay in your straw, and he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) would have whipped you under his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) left arm, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) right he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) would have tucked up his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) frock to get a penknife from out of his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) waistcoat-pocket, and he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) would have shed your blood and had your life.
<p/>No, he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) wouldn't. And what would have been your destination? '' turning on me again. '' No bringing up by hand then.
<p/>Not a bit of it!'' Joe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) was a world of trouble to you, ma'am,'' said Mrs. Hubble, commiserating my sister.
<p/>'' echoed my sister; <div class="bookquote">``trouble?''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>and then entered on a fearful catalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the acts of sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbled from, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries I had done myself, and
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Trouble? all the times she (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) had wished me in my grave, and I had contumaciously refused to go there. I think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, with their noses.
<p/>Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle's Roman nose so aggravated me, during the recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it until he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) howled.
<p/>But, all I had endured up to this time was nothing in comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the pause was broken which ensued upon my sister's recital, and in which pause everybody had looked at me -LRB-as I felt painfully conscious-RRB- with indignation and abhorrence.
<p/>Yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the theme from which they had strayed, <div class="bookquote">``Pork--regarded as biled--is rich, too; ain't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/>Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, in consequence. '' <div class="bookquote">``Have a little brandy, uncle,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said my sister. O Heavens, it had come at last!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) would find it was weak, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) would say it was weak, and I was lost! I held tight to the leg of the table under the cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.
<p/>My sister went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone bottle, and poured his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) brandy out: no one else taking any.
<p/>The wretched man trifled with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glass,--took it up, looked at it through the light, put it down,--prolonged my misery. All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe were briskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding.
<p/>Always holding tight by the leg of the table with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head back, and drink the brandy off.
<p/>Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with unspeakable consternation, owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) springing to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet, turning round several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance, and rushing out at the door; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then became visible through the window, violently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces, and apparently out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind.
<p/>I couldn't keep my eyes off him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I didn't know how I had done it, but I had no doubt
<p/>In my dreadful situation, it was a relief when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was brought back, and surveying the company all round as if they had disagreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), sank down into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair with the one significant gasp, <div class="bookquote">``Tar!
<p/>I had murdered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) somehow. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>I had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug. I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be worse by and by.
<p/>I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day, by the vigor of my unseen hold upon it. ''
<p/>But, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn't hear the word, wouldn't hear of the subject, imperiously waved it all away with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hand, and asked for hot gin and water.
<p/>My sister, who had begun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself actively in getting the gin, the hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, and mixing them.
<p/>Tar!'' cried my sister, in amazement. '' Why, how ever could Tar come there? '' For the time being at least, I was saved.
<p/>I still held on to the leg of the table, but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude. By degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of pudding.
<p/>Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding. All partook of pudding. The course terminated, and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under the genial influence of gin and water.
<p/>I clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to my bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul.
<p/>I began to think I should get over the day, when my sister said to Joe, '' Clean plates,--cold. '' I foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really was gone.
<p/>You must taste,'' said my sister, addressing the guests with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) best grace--<div class="bookquote">``you must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and delicious present of Uncle Pumblechook's!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the guests</b></font>)</div>'' Must they! Let them not hope to taste it! '' You must know,'' said my sister, rising, <div class="bookquote">``it's a pie; a savory pork pie.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>The company murmured their compliments. Uncle Pumblechook, sensible of having deserved well of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) fellow-creatures, said,--quite vivaciously, all things considered,--<div class="bookquote">``Well,
<p/>Mrs. Joe, we'll do our best endeavors; let us have a cut at this same pie. ''  (<font color='red'><b>fellow-creatures</b></font>)</div>My sister went out to get it.
<p/>I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) steps proceed to the pantry. I saw Mr. Pumblechook balance his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) knife. I saw reawakening appetite in the Roman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle.
<p/>I heard Mr. Hubble remark that <div class="bookquote">``a bit of savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do no harm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hubble</b></font>)</div>and I heard Joe say, <div class="bookquote">``You shall have some, Pip.
<p/>I have never been absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror, merely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>I felt that I could bear no more, and that I must run away. I released the leg of the table, and ran for my life.
<p/>But I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran head-foremost into a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out a pair of handcuffs to me, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Here you are, look sharp, come on!''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>The apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the but-ends of their loaded muskets on our door-step, caused the dinner-party to rise from table in confusion, and caused Mrs. Joe re-entering the kitchen empty-handed, to stop short and stare, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wondering lament of <div class="bookquote">``Gracious goodness gracious me, what's gone--with the--pie!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>The sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs. Joe stood staring; at which crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses.
<p/>It was the sergeant who had spoken to me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) was now looking round at the company, with his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) right hand, and his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) left on my shoulder.
<p/>Excuse me, ladies and gentleman,'' said the sergeant, <div class="bookquote">``but as I have mentioned at the door to this smart young shaver,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>-LRB-which he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) hadn't-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``I am on a chase in the name of the king, and I want the blacksmith.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter V '' '' And pray what might you want with him (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>)?'' retorted my sister, quick to resent his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) being wanted at all.
<p/>Missis,'' returned the gallant sergeant, ``speaking for myself, I should reply, the honor and pleasure of his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) fine wife's acquaintance; speaking for the king, I answer, a little job done.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see, blacksmith,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant, who had by this time picked out Joe with his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) eye, <div class="bookquote">``we have had an accident with these, and I find the lock of one of 'em goes wrong, and the coupling don't act pretty.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>'' This was received as rather neat in the sergeant; insomuch that Mr. Pumblechook cried audibly, <div class="bookquote">``Good again!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>As they are wanted for immediate service, will you throw your eye over them?''
<p/>Joe threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) eye over them, and pronounced that the job would necessitate the lighting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) forge fire, and would take nearer two hours than one.
<p/>'' Will it? Then will you set about it at once, blacksmith? '' said the off-hand sergeant, <div class="bookquote">``as it's on his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) Majesty's service.
<p/>With that, he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) called to his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) men, who came trooping into the kitchen one after another, and piled their arms in a corner.
<p/>And then they stood about, as soldiers do; now, with their hands loosely clasped before them; now, resting a knee or a shoulder; now, easing a belt or a pouch; now, opening the door to spit stiffly over their high stocks, out into the yard.
<p/>And if my men can bear a hand anywhere, they'll make themselves useful. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>All these things I saw without then knowing that I saw them, for I was in an agony of apprehension.
<p/>But beginning to perceive that the handcuffs were not for me, and that the military had so far got the better of the pie as to put it in the background, I collected a little more of my scattered wits.
<p/>'' said the sergeant, addressing himself to Mr. Pumblechook, as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the inference that he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) was equal to the time.
<p/>That's not so bad,'' said the sergeant, reflecting; <div class="bookquote">``even if I was forced to halt here nigh two hours, that'll do.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>Would you give me the time? '' It's just gone half past two.'' '' How far might you call yourselves from the marshes, hereabouts?
<p/>Not above a mile, I reckon?'' <div class="bookquote">``Just a mile,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Joe. '' That'll do. We begin to close in upon 'em about dusk.
<p/>A little before dusk, my orders are. That'll do.'' <div class="bookquote">``Convicts, sergeant?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Wopsle, in a matter-of-course way. '' Ay!'' returned the sergeant, <div class="bookquote">``two.
<p/>They're pretty well known to be out on the marshes still, and they won't try to get clear of 'em before dusk.
<p/>Anybody here seen anything of any such game? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>Everybody, myself excepted, said no, with confidence. Nobody thought of me. ''
<p/>Well!'' said the sergeant, <div class="bookquote">``they'll find themselves trapped in a circle, I expect, sooner than they count on. Now, blacksmith! If you're ready, his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) Majesty the King is.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>Joe had got his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) coat and waistcoat and cravat off, and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) leather apron on, and passed into the forge.
<p/>One of the soldiers opened its wooden windows, another lighted the fire, another turned to at the bellows, the rest stood round the blaze, which was soon roaring.
<p/>Then Joe began to hammer and clink, hammer and clink, and we all looked on. The interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general attention, but even made my sister liberal.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) drew a pitcher of beer from the cask for the soldiers, and invited the sergeant to take a glass of brandy.
<p/>I'll engage there's no tar in that:'' so, the sergeant thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) and said that as he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) preferred his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) drink without tar, he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) would take wine, if it was equally convenient.
<p/>When it was given him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) drank his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) Majesty's health and compliments of the season, and took it all at a mouthful and smacked his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) lips.
<p/>But Mr. Pumblechook said, sharply, <div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) wine, Mum. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>Good stuff, eh, sergeant?'' said Mr. Pumblechook. '' I'll tell you something,'' returned the sergeant; <div class="bookquote">``I suspect that stuff's of your providing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>Mr. Pumblechook, with a fat sort of laugh, said, <div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay? Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>'' Because,'' returned the sergeant, clapping him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) on the shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``you're a man that knows what's what.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' D'ye think so?'' said Mr. Pumblechook, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) former laugh. <div class="bookquote">``Have another glass!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``With you. Hob and nob,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>returned the sergeant.
<p/>The top of mine to the foot of yours,--the foot of yours to the top of mine,--Ring once, ring twice,--the best tune on the Musical Glasses!
<p/>May you live a thousand years, and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you are at the present moment of your life!''
<p/>I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hospitality appeared to forget that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had made a present of the wine, but took the bottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a gush of joviality.
<p/>'' Your health. The sergeant tossed off his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) glass again and seemed quite ready for another glass. Even I got some.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) was so very free of the wine that he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) even called for the other bottle, and handed that about with the same liberality, when the first was gone.
<p/>As I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge, enjoying themselves so much, I thought what terrible good sauce for a dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was.
<p/>And now, when they were all in lively anticipation of <div class="bookquote">``the two villains''  (<font color='red'><b>the fugitives</b></font>)</div>being taken, and when the bellows seemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoke to hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them, and all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the blaze rose and sank, and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the pale afternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned pale on their account, poor wretches.
<p/>They had not enjoyed themselves a quarter so much, before the entertainment was brightened with the excitement he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) furnished. At last, Joe's job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped.
<p/>As Joe got on his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) coat, he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) mustered courage to propose that some of us should go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt.
<p/>Mr. Pumblechook and Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladies' society; but Mr. Wopsle said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) would go, if Joe would.
<p/>We never should have got leave to go, I am sure, but for Mrs. Joe's curiosity to know all about it and how it ended.
<p/>As it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) merely stipulated, <div class="bookquote">``If you bring the boy back with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head blown to bits by a musket, don't look to me to put it together again.
<p/>The sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr. Pumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) were quite as fully sensible of that gentleman's merits under arid conditions, as when something moist was going.
<p/>Joe said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was agreeable, and would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) men resumed their muskets and fell in.
<p/>Mr. Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, and to speak no word after we reached the marshes.
<p/>When we were all out in the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I treasonably whispered to Joe, <div class="bookquote">``I hope, Joe, we shan't find them.
<p/>We were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather was cold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness coming on, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>and Joe whispered to me, <div class="bookquote">``I'd give a shilling if they had cut and run, Pip. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>A few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none came out.
<p/>There we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant's hand, while two or three of his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) men dispersed themselves among the graves, and also examined the porch.
<p/>They came in again without finding anything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate at the side of the churchyard.
<p/>We passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard. A bitter sleet came rattling against us here on the east wind, and Joe took me on his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) back.
<p/>Now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little thought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men hiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we should come upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I who had brought the soldiers there?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) had asked me if I was a deceiving imp, and he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the hunt against him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>).
<p/>Would he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) believe that I was both imp and hound in treacherous earnest, and had betrayed him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>)? It was of no use asking myself this question now.
<p/>There I was, on Joe's back, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like a hunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) Roman nose, and to keep up with us.
<p/>The soldiers were in front of us, extending into a pretty wide line with an interval between man and man. We were taking the course I had begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist.
<p/>Under the low red glare of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and the mound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain, though all of a watery lead color.
<p/>With my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe's broad shoulder, I looked all about for any sign of the convicts.
<p/>Either the mist was not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it. I could see none, I could hear none.
<p/>Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) blowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, and could dissociate them from the object of pursuit.
<p/>The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us; and the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, stared angrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, except these things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass, there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes.
<p/>The soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery, and we were moving on a little way behind them, when, all of a sudden, we all stopped.
<p/>I got a dreadful start, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only a sheep-bell. For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a long shout.
<p/>It was repeated. It was at a distance towards the east, but it was long and loud. Nay, there seemed to be
<p/>two or more shouts raised together,--if one might judge from a confusion in the sound. To this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under their breath, when Joe and I came up.
<p/>The sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that the sound should not be answered, but that the course should be changed, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) men should make towards it <div class="bookquote">``at the double.
<p/>After another moment's listening, Joe -LRB-who was a good judge-RRB- agreed, and Mr. Wopsle -LRB-who was a bad judge-RRB- agreed. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div><p/>So we slanted to the right -LRB-where the East was-RRB-, and Joe pounded away so wonderfully, that I had to hold on tight to keep my seat.
<p/>It was a run indeed now, and what Joe called, in the only two words he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) spoke all the time, <div class="bookquote">``a Winder.
<p/>Down banks and up banks, and over gates, and splashing into dikes, and breaking among coarse rushes: no man cared where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went.
<p/>As we came nearer to the shouting, it became more and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Sometimes, it seemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped. When it broke out again, the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever, and we after them.
<p/>After a while, we had so run it down, that we could hear one voice calling <div class="bookquote">``Murder!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and another voice, <div class="bookquote">``Convicts!
<p/>Runaways! Guard! This way for the runaway convicts! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then both voices would seem to be stifled in a struggle, and then would break out again.
<p/>The sergeant ran in first, when we had run the noise quite down, and two of his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) men ran in close upon him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>).
<p/>And when it had come to this, the soldiers ran like deer, and Joe too. Their pieces were cocked and levelled when we all ran in.
<p/>'' Here are both men! '' panted the sergeant, struggling at the bottom of a ditch. '' Surrender, you two! and confound you for two wild beasts!
<p/>Water was splashing, and mud was flying, and oaths were being sworn, and blows were being struck, when some more men went down into the ditch to help the sergeant, and dragged out, separately, my convict and the other one.
<p/>Come asunder!'' Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling; but of course I knew them both directly. '' Mind!
<p/>'' said my convict, wiping blood from his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) ragged sleeves, and shaking torn hair from his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) fingers: <div class="bookquote">``I took him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>)!
<p/>It's not much to be particular about,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant; <div class="bookquote">``it'll do you small good, my man, being in the same plight yourself.
<p/>I give him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) up to you! Mind that!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>'' Handcuffs there!'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't expect it to do me any good. I don't want it to do me more good than it does now,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said my convict, with a greedy laugh.
<p/>The other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the old bruised left side of his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) could not so much as get his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) breath to speak, until they were both separately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from falling.
<p/>'' I took him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) knows it. That's enough for me. '' '' Take notice, guard,--he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) tried to murder me,'' were his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) first words.
<p/>'' Tried to murder him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)?'' said my convict, disdainfully. <div class="bookquote">``Try, and not do it? I took him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>), and giv' him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) up; that's what I done.
<p/>I not only prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) getting off the marshes, but I dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) here,--dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) this far on his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) way back.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)'s a gentleman, if you please, this villain. Now, the Hulks has got its gentleman again, through me. Murder him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)? Worth my while, too, to murder him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), when I could do worse and drag him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The other one still gasped, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) tried--he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) tried-to--murder me. Bear--bear witness.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Lookee here!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said my convict to the sergeant. ''
<p/>I could ha' got clear of these death-cold flats likewise--look at my leg: you won't find much iron on it--if I hadn't made the discovery that he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) was here.
<p/>Single-handed I got clear of the prison-ship; I made a dash and I done it. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) go free? Let him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) profit by the means as I found out?
<p/>If I had died at the bottom there,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) manacled hands, <div class="bookquote">``I'd have held to him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) with that grip, that you should have been safe to find him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) in my hold.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) make a tool of me afresh and again? Once more? No, no, no. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The other fugitive, who was evidently in extreme horror of his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) companion, repeated, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) tried to murder me.
<p/>I should have been a dead man if you had not come up.''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lies!'' said my convict, with fierce energy.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a liar born, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll die a liar. Look at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face; ain't it written there? Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turn those eyes of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on me.
<p/>The other, with an effort at a scornful smile, which could not, however, collect the nervous working of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth into any set expression, looked at the soldiers, and looked about at the marshes and at the sky, but certainly did not look at the speaker.
<p/>I defy him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) to do it. '' '' Do you see him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)?'' pursued my convict. '' Do you see what a villain he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) is?
<p/>Do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes? That's how he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) looked when we were tried together. He (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) never looked at me.
<p/>The other, always working and working his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) dry lips and turning his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) eyes restlessly about him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) far and near, did at last turn them for a moment on the speaker, with the words, <div class="bookquote">``You are not much to look at,''  (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div>and with a half-taunting glance at the bound hands.
<p/>At that point, my convict became so frantically exasperated, that he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) would have rushed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) but for the interposition of the soldiers.
<p/>And any one could see that he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) shook with fear, and that there broke out upon his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) lips curious white flakes, like thin snow.
<p/>'' '' Didn't I tell you,'' said the other convict then, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) would murder me, if he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) could? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>As one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in lieu of a gun, went down on his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) knee to open it, my convict looked round him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) for the first time, and saw me.
<p/>I had alighted from Joe's back on the brink of the ditch when we came up, and had not moved since.
<p/>Enough of this parley,'' said the sergeant. '' Light those torches. '' I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) eagerly when he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and shook my head.
<p/>It was not at all expressed to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) even comprehended my intention, for he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) gave me a look that I did not understand, and it all passed in a moment.
<p/>But if he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) had looked at me for an hour or for a day, I could not have remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) face ever afterwards, as having been more attentive.
<p/>The soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or four torches, and took one himself and distributed the others.
<p/>I had been waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) to see me that I might try to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) of my innocence. It had been almost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards very dark.
<p/>Presently we saw other torches kindled at some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the opposite bank of the river.
<p/>Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in a ring, fired twice into the air. '' All right,'' said the sergeant.
<p/>We had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a sound that seemed to burst something inside my ear.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``March. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>'' You are expected on board,'' said the sergeant to my convict; <div class="bookquote">``they know you are coming. Don't straggle, my man.
<p/>Close up here. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>The two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separate guard. I had hold of Joe's hand now, and Joe carried one of the torches.
<p/>Mr. Wopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to see it out, so we went on with the party.
<p/>There was a reasonably good path now, mostly on the edge of the river, with a divergence here and there where a dike came, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy sluice-gate.
<p/>The torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon the track, and I could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring.
<p/>When I looked round, I could see the other lights coming in after us. I could see nothing else but black darkness.
<p/>Our lights warmed the air about us with their pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather to like that, as they limped along in the midst of the muskets.
<p/>We could not go fast, because of their lameness; and they were so spent, that two or three times we had to halt while they rested.
<p/>After an hour or so of this travelling, we came to a rough wooden hut and a landing-place. There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged, and the sergeant answered.
<p/>Then, we went into the hut, where there was a smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and a stand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like an overgrown mangle without the machinery, capable of holding about a dozen soldiers all at once.
<p/>Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in their great-coats were not much interested in us, but just lifted their heads and took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again.
<p/>The sergeant made some kind of report, and some entry in a book, and then the convict whom I call the other convict was drafted off with his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) guard, to go on board first.
<p/>While we stood in the hut, he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting up his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as if he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) pitied them for their recent adventures.
<p/>My convict never looked at me, except that once. Suddenly, he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) turned to the sergeant, and remarked,-- ``I wish to say something respecting this escape.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You can say what you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>returned the sergeant, standing coolly looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) arms folded, <div class="bookquote">``but you have no call to say it here.
<p/>It may prevent some persons laying under suspicion alonger me.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>You'll have opportunity enough to say about it, and hear about it, before it's done with, you know.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I know, but this is another pint, a separate matter. A man can't starve; at least I can't. I took some wittles, up at the willage over
<p/>yonder,--where the church stands a`most out on the marshes. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You mean stole,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant. '' And I'll tell you where from.
<p/>From the blacksmith's. '' <div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>said the sergeant, staring at Joe. '' Halloa, Pip!'' said Joe, staring at me. '' It was some broken wittles--that's what it was--and a dram of liquor, and a pie.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the sergeant</b></font>)</div>asked the sergeant, confidentially. '' My wife did, at the very moment when you came in.
<p/>Don't you know, Pip?'' <div class="bookquote">``So,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said my convict, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) eyes on Joe in a moody manner, and without the least glance at me,--``so
<p/><div class="bookquote">``God knows you're welcome to it,--so far as it was ever mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>returned Joe, with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe.
<p/>We don't know what you have done, but we wouldn't have you starved to death for it, poor miserable fellow-creatur.--Would us, Pip?
<p/>you're the blacksmith, are you? Than I'm sorry to say, I've eat your pie.'' '' '' The something that I had noticed before, clicked in the man's throat again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back.
<p/>The boat had returned, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guard were ready, so we followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the landing-place made of rough stakes and stones, and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put into the boat, which was rowed by a crew of convicts like himself.
<p/>No one seemed surprised to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or interested in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or sorry to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or spoke a word, except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs, <div class="bookquote">``Give way, you!''  (<font color='red'><b>that somebody</b></font>)</div>which was the signal for the dip of the oars.
<p/>By the light of the torches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from the mud of the shore, like a wicked Noah's ark.
<p/>Cribbed and barred and moored by massive rusty chains, the prison-ship seemed in my young eyes to be ironed like the prisoners.
<p/>Then, the ends of the torches were flung hissing into the water, and went out, as if it were all over with him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>).
<p/>My state of mind regarding the pilfering from which I had been so unexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure; but I hope it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it.
<p/>I do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference to Mrs. Joe, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me.
<p/>But I loved Joe,--perhaps for no better reason in those early days than because the dear fellow let me love him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>),--and, as to him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>), my inner self was not so easily composed.
<p/>It was much upon my mind -LRB-particularly when I first saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) looking about for his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) file-RRB- that I ought to tell Joe the whole truth.
<p/>Yet I did not, and for the reason that I mistrusted that if I did, he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) would think me worse than I was.
<p/>The fear of losing Joe's confidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at night staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend, tied up my tongue.
<p/>I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it, I never afterwards could see him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) at the fireside feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fair whisker, without thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was meditating on it.
<p/>That, if Joe knew it, I never afterwards could see him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) glance, however casually, at yesterday's meat or pudding when it came on to-day's table, without thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was debating whether I had been in the pantry.
<p/>That, if Joe knew it, and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) beer was flat or thick, the conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) suspected tar in it, would bring a rush of blood to my face.
<p/>In a word, I was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right, as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong.
<p/>I had had no intercourse with the world at that time, and I imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this manner.
<p/>We saw the boat go alongside, and we saw him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) taken up the side and disappear. Chapter VI Quite an untaught genius, I made the discovery of the line of action for myself.
<p/>As I was sleepy before we were far away from the prison-ship, Joe took me on his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) back again and carried me home.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) must have had a tiresome journey of it, for Mr. Wopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very bad temper that if the Church had been thrown open, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) would probably have excommunicated the whole expedition, beginning with Joe and myself.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) lay capacity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) persisted in sitting down in the damp to such an insane extent, that when his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) coat was taken off to be dried at the kitchen fire, the circumstantial evidence on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) trousers would have hanged him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>), if it had been a capital offence.
<p/>By that time, I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little drunkard, through having been newly set upon my feet, and through having been fast asleep, and through waking in the heat and lights and noise of tongues.
<p/>Was there ever such a boy as this!'' from my sister,-RRB- I found Joe telling them about the convict's confession, and all the visitors suggesting different ways by which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had got into the pantry.
<p/>Mr. Pumblechook made out, after carefully surveying the premises, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had first got upon the roof of the forge, and had then got upon the roof of the house, and had then let himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) bedding cut into strips; and as Mr. Pumblechook was very positive and drove his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) own chaise-cart--over everybody--it was agreed that it must be so.
<p/>Mr. Wopsle, indeed, wildly cried out, <div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>with the feeble malice of a tired man; but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no theory, and no coat on, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was unanimously set at naught,--not to mention his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smoking hard behind, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out: which was not calculated to inspire confidence.
<p/>This was all I heard that night before my sister clutched me, as a slumberous offence to the company's eyesight, and assisted me up to bed with such a strong hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on, and to be dangling them all against the edges of the stairs.
<p/>My state of mind, as I have described it, began before I was up in the morning, and lasted long after the subject had died out, and had ceased to be mentioned saving on exceptional occasions.
<p/>As I came to myself -LRB-with the aid of a heavy thump between the shoulders, and the restorative exclamation ``Yah! Chapter VII
<p/>At the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the family tombstones, I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out.
<p/>My construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct, for I read <div class="bookquote">``wife of the Above''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>as a complimentary reference to my father's exaltation to a better world; and if any one of my deceased relations had been referred to as <div class="bookquote">``Below,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>I have no doubt I should have formed the worst opinions of that member of the family.
<p/>Neither were my notions of the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me, at all accurate; for, I have a lively remembrance that I supposed my declaration that I was to <div class="bookquote">``walk in the same all the days of my life,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our house in one particular direction, and never to vary it by turning down by the wheelwright's or up by the mill.
<p/>When I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and until I could assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called <div class="bookquote">``Pompeyed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>or -LRB-as I render it-RRB- pampered.
<p/>Therefore, I was not only odd-boy about the forge, but if any neighbor happened to want an extra boy to frighten birds, or pick up stones, or do any such job, I was favored with the employment.
<p/>In order, however, that our superior position might not be compromised thereby, a money-box was kept on the kitchen mantel-shelf, into which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were dropped.
<p/>I have an impression that they were to be contributed eventually towards the liquidation of the National Debt, but I know I had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure.
<p/>Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt kept an evening school in the village; that is to say, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited infirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, in the society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for the improving opportunity of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) do it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) rented a small cottage, and Mr. Wopsle had the room upstairs, where we students used to overhear him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, and occasionally bumping on the ceiling.
<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) did on those occasions was to turn up his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) cuffs, stick up his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) hair, and give us Mark Antony's oration over the body of Caesar.
<p/>This was always followed by Collins's Ode on the Passions, wherein I particularly venerated Mr. Wopsle as Revenge throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) blood-stained sword in thunder down, and taking the War-denouncing trumpet with a withering look.
<p/>It was not with me then, as it was in later life, when I fell into the society of the Passions, and compared them with Collins and Wopsle, rather to the disadvantage of both gentlemen.
<p/>There was a fiction that Mr. Wopsle <div class="bookquote">``examined''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>the scholars once a quarter. Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt, besides keeping this Educational Institution, kept in the same room--a little general shop.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) had no idea what stock she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) had, or what the price of anything in it was; but there was a little greasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served as a Catalogue of Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shop transactions.
<p/>Biddy was Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's granddaughter; I confess myself quite unequal to the working out of the problem, what relation she (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) was to Mr. Wopsle.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) was most noticeable, I thought, in respect of her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) extremities; for, her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) hair always wanted brushing, her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) hands always wanted washing, and her (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at heel.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>granddaughter</b></font>) was an orphan like myself; like me, too, had been brought up by hand. This description must be received with a week-day limitation.
<p/>Much of my unassisted self, and more by the help of Biddy than of Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt, I struggled through the alphabet as if it had been a bramble-bush; getting considerably worried and scratched by every letter.
<p/>After that I fell among those thieves, the nine figures, who seemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and baffle recognition.
<p/>On Sundays, she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) went to church elaborated. But, at last I began, in a purblind groping way, to read, write, and cipher, on the very smallest scale.
<p/>One night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate, expending great efforts on the production of a letter to Joe.
<p/>I think it must have been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes, for it was a long time after, and it was winter and a hard frost.
<p/>With an alphabet on the hearth at my feet for reference, I contrived in an hour or two to print and smear this epistle:-- <div class="bookquote">``MI DEER JO
<p/>i OPE U R KRWITE WELL i OPE i SHAL SON B HABELL 4 2 TEEDGE U JO AN THEN WE SHORL B SO GLODD
<p/>There was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with Joe by letter, inasmuch as he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) sat beside me and we were alone.
<p/>But I delivered this written communication -LRB-slate and all-RRB- with my own hand, and Joe received it as a miracle of erudition.
<p/>AN WEN i M PRENGTD 2 U JO WOT LARX AN BLEVE ME INF XN PIP. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I say, Pip, old chap!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, glancing at the slate as he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) held it; with a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly.
<p/>'' cried Joe, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) blue eyes wide, <div class="bookquote">``what a scholar you are! An't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>'' Why, here's a J,'' said Joe, ``and a O equal to anythink!
<p/>I had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this monosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday, when I accidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to suit his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) convenience quite as well as if it had been all right.
<p/>Wishing to embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe, I should have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, <div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>Here's a J and a O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But read the rest, Jo.'' '' The rest, eh, Pip?'' said Joe, looking at it with a slow, searching eye, <div class="bookquote">``One, two, three.
<p/>Why, here's three Js, and three Os, and three J-O, Joes in it, Pip! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>I leaned over Joe, and, with the aid of my forefinger read him (<font color='blue'><b>Joes</b></font>) the whole letter.
<p/>'' Astonishing! '' said Joe, when I had finished. '' You ARE a scholar. '' <div class="bookquote">``How do you spell Gargery, Joe?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>), with a modest patronage. '' I don't spell it at all,'' said Joe. '' But supposing you did?''
<p/>Give me,'' said Joe, ``a good book, or a good newspaper, and sit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It can't be supposed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. '' Tho' I'm uncommon fond of reading, too.'' <div class="bookquote">``Are you, Joe? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``On-common. Lord! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) continued, after rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) knees a little, <div class="bookquote">``when you do come to a J and a O, and says you, `Here, at last, is a J-O, Joe,' how interesting reading is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I derived from this, that Joe's education, like Steam, was yet in its infancy. Pursuing the subject, I inquired,-- <div class="bookquote">``Didn't you ever go to school,
<p/>Joe, when you were as little as me?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Pip. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Pip/Mr. Pip</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, Pip,'' said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) usual occupation when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) was thoughtful, of slowly raking the fire between the lower bars; <div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you.
<p/>My father, Pip, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) were given to drink, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) were overtook with drink, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) hammered away at my mother, most onmerciful.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) hammered at me with a wigor only to be equalled by the wigor with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) didn't hammer at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) anwil.--You're a listening and understanding, Pip?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>`Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father several times; and then my mother she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d go out to work, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'d say, <div class="bookquote">``Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'d say, <div class="bookquote">``now, please God, you shall have some schooling, child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'d put me to school.
<p/>'' It were a`most the only hammering he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did, indeed, `xcepting at myself. '' Yes, Joe. '' '' But my father were that good in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hart that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) couldn't abear to be without us.
<p/>So, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)'d come with a most tremenjous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where we was, that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us and to give us up to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>Which, you see, Pip,'' said Joe, pausing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) meditative raking of the fire, and looking at me, <div class="bookquote">``were a drawback on my learning.
<p/>Though mind you, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of the poker on the top bar, <div class="bookquote">``rendering unto all their doo, and maintaining equal justice betwixt man and man, my father were that good in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hart, don't you see?
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took us home and hammered us. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Certainly, poor Joe! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' I didn't see; but I didn't say so.

<p/>In time I were able to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and I kep him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went off in a purple leptic fit.
<p/>And it were my intentions to have had put upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tombstone that, Whatsume'er the failings on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) part, Remember reader
<p/>Joe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful perspicuity, that I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had made it himself.
<p/>'' , I assure you, Pip. he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) were that good in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) heart.'' '' I made it,'' said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``my own self.
<p/>I made it in a moment. It was like striking out a horseshoe complete, in a single blow. I never was so much surprised in all my life,--couldn't credit
<p/>As I was saying, Pip, it were my intentions to have had it cut over him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>); but poetry costs money, cut it how you will, small or large, and it were not done.
<p/>my own ed,--to tell you the truth, hardly believed it were my own ed. Not to mention bearers, all the money that could be spared were wanted for my mother.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were in poor elth, and quite broke. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) weren't long of following, poor soul, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) share of peace come round at last.
<p/>Joe's blue eyes turned a little watery; he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) rubbed first one of them, and then the other, in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner, with the round knob on the top of the poker.
<p/>Now, Pip,'' (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>--Joe looked firmly at me as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) knew I was not going to agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>);--<div class="bookquote">``your sister is a fine figure of a woman.

''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>I could not help looking at the fire, in an obvious state of doubt.
<p/>Whatever family opinions, or whatever the world's opinions, on that subject may be, Pip, your sister is,'' Joe tapped the top bar with the poker after every word following, <div class="bookquote">``a-fine-figure--of--a--woman!

<p/>'' I am glad I think so, Pip. A little redness or a little matter of Bone, here or there, what does it signify to Me?
<p/>'' I sagaciously observed, if it didn't signify to him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), to whom did it signify? '' Certainly!'' assented Joe. '' That's it.
<p/>You're right, old chap! When I got acquainted with your sister, it were the talk how she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was bringing you up by hand.
<p/>As to you,'' Joe pursued with a countenance expressive of seeing something very nasty indeed, <div class="bookquote">``if you could have been aware how small and flabby and
<p/>Very kind of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) too, all the folks said, and I said, along with all the folks. mean you was, dear me, you'd have formed the most contemptible opinion of yourself!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Not exactly relishing this, I said, <div class="bookquote">``Never mind me, Joe.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' But I did mind you, Pip,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) returned with tender simplicity.
<p/>When I offered to your sister to keep company, and to be asked in church at such times as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was willing and ready to come to the forge, I said to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), `And bring the poor little child.
<p/>I broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round the neck: who dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, <div class="bookquote">``Ever the best of friends; an't us, Pip?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>God bless the poor little child,' I said to your sister, `there's room for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) at the forge!' '' Don't cry, old chap!''
<p/>When this little interruption was over, Joe resumed:-- '' Well, you see, Pip, and here we are! That's about where it lights; here we are!
<p/>Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip -LRB-and I tell you beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull-RRB-, Mrs. Joe mustn't see too much of what we're up to.
<p/>It must be done, as I may say, on the sly. And why on the sly? I'll tell you why, Pip.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) could have proceeded in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) demonstration. ''
<p/>-LRB-and I am afraid I must add, hope-RRB- that Joe had divorced her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) in a favor of the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury.

<p/>'' I was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as <div class="bookquote">``Why--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>when Joe stopped me. ''
<p/>Stay a bit. I know what you're a going to say, Pip; stay a bit! I don't deny that your sister comes the Mo-gul over us, now and again.
<p/>At such times as when your sister is on the Ram-page, Pip,'' Joe sank his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) voice to a whisper and glanced at the door, <div class="bookquote">``candor compels fur to admit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) is a Buster.
<p/>I don't deny that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) do throw us back-falls, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) do drop down upon us heavy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capital Bs.
<p/>Well,'' said Joe, passing the poker in to his (<font color='blue'><b>Buster</b></font>) left hand, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Buster</b></font>) might feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Buster</b></font>) whisker; and I had no hope of him (<font color='blue'><b>Buster</b></font>) whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Buster</b></font>) took to that placid occupation;
<p/>'' Why don't I rise? That were your observation when I broke it off, Pip?'' '' Yes, Joe.'' '' ``your sister's a master-mind.

'' And I ain't a master-mind,'' Joe resumed, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Buster</b></font>) had unfixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Buster</b></font>) look, and got back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Buster</b></font>) whisker.
<p/>I want to say very serious to you, old chap,--I see so much in my poor mother, of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) honest hart and never getting no peace in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mortal days, that I'm dead afeerd of going wrong in the way of not doing what's right by a woman, and I'd fur rather of the two go wrong the t`other way, and be a little ill-conwenienced myself.
<p/>I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; I wish there warn't no Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I could take it all on myself; but this is the up-and-down-and-straight on it, Pip, and I hope you'll overlook shortcomings.
<p/>'' And last of all, Pip,--and this '' Young as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe from that night.
<p/>We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; but, afterwards at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking about him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>), I had a new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up to Joe in my heart.
<p/>However,'' said Joe, rising to replenish the fire; <div class="bookquote">``here's the Dutch-clock a working himself up to being equal to strike Eight of 'em, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'s not come home yet!
<p/>Mrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on market-days, to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a woman's judgment; Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no confidences in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) domestic servant.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>I hope Uncle Pumblechook's mare mayn't have set a forefoot on a piece o' ice, and gone down. '' This was market-day, and Mrs. Joe was out on one of these expeditions.
<p/>Joe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the door to listen for the chaise-cart. It was a dry cold night, and the wind blew keenly, and the frost was white and hard.
<p/>And then I looked at the stars, and considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face up to them as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the glittering multitude.
<p/>A man would die to-night of lying out on the marshes, I thought. '' Here comes the mare,'' said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``ringing like a peal of bells!
<p/>The sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) came along at a much brisker trot than usual.
<p/>We got a chair out, ready for Mrs. Joe's alighting, and stirred up the fire that they might see a bright window, and took a final survey of the kitchen that nothing might be out of its place.
<p/>Mrs. Joe was soon landed, and Uncle Pumblechook was soon down too, covering the mare with a cloth, and we were soon all in the kitchen, carrying so much cold air in with us that it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire.
<p/>Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Joe, unwrapping herself with haste and excitement, and throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) bonnet back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) shoulders where it hung by the strings, <div class="bookquote">``if this boy ain't grateful this night, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) never will be!

<p/>My sister catching him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) in the act, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) drew the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) nose with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) usual conciliatory air on such occasions, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>).

<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Miss Havisham, up town?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. '' Is there any Miss Havisham down town? '' returned my sister. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wants this boy to go and play there.

<p/>For you do not know that Uncle Pumblechook, being sensible that for anything we can tell, this boy's fortune may be made by his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) going to Miss Havisham's, has offered to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) into town to-night in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) own chaise-cart, and to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) to-night, and to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) own hands to Miss Havisham's to-morrow morning.

<p/>When my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen of the stiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and was trussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit.
<p/>I was then delivered over to Mr. Pumblechook, who formally received me as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) were the Sheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had been dying to make all along: <div class="bookquote">``Boy, be forever grateful to all friends, but especially unto them which brought you up by hand!''

<p/>I had never parted from him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) before, and what with my feelings and what with soapsuds, I could at first see no stars from the chaise-cart.
<p/>But they twinkled out one by one, without throwing any light on the questions why on earth I was going to play at Miss Havisham's, and what on earth
<p/>Mr. Pumblechook's premises in the High Street of the market town, were of a peppercorny and farinaceous character, as the premises of a cornchandler and seedsman should be.
<p/>It appeared to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) must be a very happy man indeed, to have so many little drawers in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) shop; and I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, and saw the tied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower-seeds and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, and bloom.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was expected to play at. Chapter VIII It was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this speculation.
<p/>On the previous night, I had been sent straight to bed in an attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where the bedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my eyebrows.
<p/>Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so did his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavor about the corduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and flavor about the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that I hardly knew which was which.
<p/>The same opportunity served me for noticing that Mr. Pumblechook appeared to conduct his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) business by looking across the street at the saddler, who appeared to transact his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) business by keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) eye on the coachmaker, who appeared to get on in life by putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) pockets and contemplating the baker, who in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) turn folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) arms and stared at the grocer, who stood at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) door and yawned at the chemist.
<p/>The watchmaker, always poring over a little desk with a magnifying-glass at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) eye, and always inspected by a group of smock-frocks poring over him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) through the glass of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) shop-window, seemed to be about the only person in the High Street whose trade engaged his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) attention.
<p/>Mr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o'clock in the parlor behind the shop, while the shopman took his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) mug of tea and hunch of bread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises.
<p/>Besides being possessed by my sister's idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be imparted to my diet,--besides giving me as much crumb as possible in combination with as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm water into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the milk out altogether,--his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic.
<p/>In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity between seeds and corduroys. I considered Mr. Pumblechook wretched company. On my politely bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) Good morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) said, pompously, <div class="bookquote">``Seven times nine, boy?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And how should I be able to answer, dodged in that way, in a strange place, on an empty stomach!
<p/>I was hungry, but before I had swallowed a morsel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) began a running sum that lasted all through the breakfast.
<p/>'' Seven?'' '' And four?'' '' And eight?'' '' And six?'' '' And two?'' '' And ten? '' And so on.
<p/>And after each figure was disposed of, it was as much as I could do to get a bite or a sup, before the next came; while he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) sat at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) ease guessing nothing, and eating bacon and hot roll, in -LRB-if I may be allowed the expression-RRB- a gorging and gormandizing manner.
<p/>For such reasons, I was very glad when ten o'clock came and we started for Miss Havisham's; though I was not at all at my ease regarding the manner in which I should acquit myself under that lady's roof.
<p/>Within a quarter of an hour we came to Miss Havisham's house, which was of old brick, and dismal, and had a great many iron bars to it.
<p/>There was a courtyard in front, and that was barred; so we had to wait, after ringing the bell, until some one should come to open it.
<p/>Some of the windows had been walled up; of those that remained, all the lower were rustily barred. While we waited at the gate, I peeped in -LRB-even then Mr. Pumblechook said, <div class="bookquote">``And fourteen?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>but I pretended not to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)-RRB-, and saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery.
<p/>No brewing was going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long long time. A window was raised, and a clear voice demanded <div class="bookquote">``What name?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The voice returned, <div class="bookquote">``Quite right,''  (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div>and the window was shut again, and a young lady came across the court-yard, with keys in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand.
<p/>To which my conductor replied, <div class="bookquote">``Pumblechook. ''  (<font color='red'><b>conductor</b></font>)</div>'' This,'' said Mr. Pumblechook, <div class="bookquote">``is Pip. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>'' This is Pip, is it?
<p/>'' returned the young lady, who was very pretty and seemed very proud; <div class="bookquote">``come in, Pip. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>Mr. Pumblechook was coming in also, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) with the gate.
<p/>'' Oh!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said. '' Did you wish to see Miss Havisham?'' '' If Miss Havisham wished to see me,'' returned Mr. Pumblechook, discomfited.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr. Pumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not protest.
<p/>'' Ah!'' said the girl; <div class="bookquote">``but you see she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) don't. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) eyed me severely,--as if I had done anything to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)!--and departed with the words reproachfully delivered: <div class="bookquote">``Boy!
<p/>Let your behavior here be a credit unto them which brought you up by hand! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was not free from apprehension that he (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) would come back to propound through the gate, <div class="bookquote">``And sixteen?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) didn't. My young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the courtyard. It was paved and clean, but grass was growing in every crevice.
<p/>The brewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it, and the wooden gates of that lane stood open, and all the brewery beyond stood open, away to the high enclosing wall; and all was empty and disused.
<p/>The cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate; and it made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the brewery, like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) saw me looking at it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``You could drink without hurt all the strong beer that's brewed there now, boy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think I could, miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, in a shy way. '' Better not try to brew beer there now, or it would turn out sour, boy;
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Not that anybody means to try,''  (<font color='red'><b>boy</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``for that's all done with, and the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls.
<p/>don't you think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It looks like it, miss. As to strong beer, there's enough of it in the cellars already, to drown the Manor House.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is that the name of this house, miss?''  (<font color='red'><b>boy</b></font>)</div>'' One of its names, boy.'' <div class="bookquote">``It has more than one, then, miss?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' One more. Its other name was Satis; which is Greek, or Latin, or Hebrew, or all three--or all one to me--for enough.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Enough House,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; <div class="bookquote">``that's a curious name, miss. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) replied; ``but it meant more than it said.
<p/>It meant, when it was given, that whoever had this house could want nothing else. They must have been easily satisfied in those days, I should think.
<p/>Though she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) called me <div class="bookquote">``boy''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>so often, and with a carelessness that was far from complimentary, she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was of about my own age.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) seemed much older than I, of course, being a girl, and beautiful and self-possessed; and she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was as scornful of me as if she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had been one-and-twenty, and a queen.
<p/>But don't loiter, boy. '' We went into the house by a side door, the great front entrance had two chains across it outside,--and
<p/>the first thing I noticed was, that the passages were all dark, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had left a candle burning there.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase, and still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.
<p/>At last we came to the door of a room, and she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Go in. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I answered, more in shyness than politeness, <div class="bookquote">``After you, miss.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>To this she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) returned: <div class="bookquote">``Don't be ridiculous, boy; I am not going in. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And scornfully walked away, and--what was worse--took the candle with her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>).
<p/>However, the only thing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was told from within to enter.
<p/>This was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid. I entered, therefore, and found myself in a pretty large room, well lighted with wax candles.
<p/>It was a dressing-room, as I supposed from the furniture, though much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me.
<p/>But prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded looking-glass, and that I made out at first sight to be a fine lady's dressing-table.
<p/>Whether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no fine lady sitting at it, I cannot say.
<p/>In an arm-chair, with an elbow resting on the table and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head leaning on that hand, sat the strangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see.
<p/>No glimpse of daylight was to be seen in it. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was dressed in rich materials,--satins, and lace, and silks,--all of white.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a long white veil dependent from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hair, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had bridal flowers in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hair, but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hair was white.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shoes were white. Some bright jewels sparkled on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) neck and on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands, and some other jewels lay sparkling on the table.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had not quite finished dressing, for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had but one shoe on,--the other was on the table near her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand,--her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) veil was but half arranged, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bosom lay with those trinkets, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) handkerchief, and gloves, and some flowers, and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about the looking-glass.
<p/>It was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though I saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed.
<p/>But I saw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been white long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow.
<p/>I saw that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and like the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) sunken eyes.
<p/>I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure of a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had shrunk to skin and bone.
<p/>Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly waxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage lying in state.
<p/>Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of a vault under the church pavement.
<p/>Dresses, less splendid than the dress she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes that moved and looked at me.
<p/>I should have cried out, if I could. '' Who is it?'' said the lady at the table. '' Pip, ma'am.''
<p/>It was when I stood before her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), avoiding her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes, that I took note of the surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) watch had stopped at twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pip?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>'' Mr. Pumblechook's boy, ma'am. Come--to play.'' <div class="bookquote">``Come nearer; let me look at you. Come close. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Look at me,'' said Miss Havisham.
<p/>'' You are not afraid of a woman who has never seen the sun since you were born? '' I regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie comprehended in the answer
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you know what I touch here? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands, one upon the other, on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) left side.
<p/>'' Yes, ma'am. '' -LRB-It made me think of the young man.-RRB- '' What do I touch? '' <div class="bookquote">``Your heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Broken!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it.
<p/>Afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as if they were heavy. ''
<p/>I think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances.
<p/>I am tired,'' said Miss Havisham. '' I want diversion, and I have done with men and women. Play. '' ''
<p/>I sometimes have sick fancies,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">``and I have a sick fancy that I want to see some play.
<p/>For a moment, with the fear of my sister's working me before my eyes, I had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed character of Mr. Pumblechook's chaise-cart.
<p/>But I felt myself so unequal to the performance that I gave it up, and stood looking at Miss Havisham in what I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) took for a dogged manner, inasmuch as she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) said,
<p/>There, there!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>with an impatient movement of the fingers of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) right hand; <div class="bookquote">``play, play, play!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>when we had taken a good look at each other,-- <div class="bookquote">``Are you sullen and obstinate?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister, so I would do it if I could; but it's so new here, and so strange, and so fine,--and melancholy--.
<p/>I stopped, fearing I might say too much, or had already said it, and we took another look at each other.
<p/>Before she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) spoke again, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) eyes from me, and looked at the dress she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wore, and at the dressing-table, and finally at herself in the looking-glass.
<p/>So new to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),'' she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) muttered, <div class="bookquote">``so old to me; so strange to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), so familiar to me; so melancholy to both of us!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>No, ma'am, I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can't play just now. '' '' Call Estella.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was still looking at the reflection of herself, I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was still talking to herself, and kept quiet.
<p/>'' '' Call Estella,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) repeated, flashing a look at me. '' You can do that. Call Estella. At the door.
<p/>To stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house, bawling Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor responsive, and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) name, was almost as bad as playing to order.
<p/>Miss Havisham beckoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) to come close, and took up a jewel from the table, and tried its effect upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) fair young bosom and against her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) pretty brown hair.
<p/>'' But she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) answered at last, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) light came along the dark passage like a star. '' Your own, one day, my dear, and you will use it well.
<p/>Let me see you play cards with this boy.'' '' With this boy? Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is a common laboring boy! ''
<p/>I thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer,--only it seemed so unlikely,--<div class="bookquote">``Well? You can break his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' What do you play, boy?
<p/>'' asked Estella of myself, with the greatest disdain. '' Nothing but beggar my neighbor, miss. '' <div class="bookquote">``Beggar him (<font color='blue'><b>Beggar</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham to Estella.
<p/>It was then I began to understand that everything in the room had stopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago.
<p/>So we sat down to cards. I noticed that Miss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had taken it up.
<p/>As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at the dressing-table again, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, now yellow, had never been worn.
<p/>I glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent, and saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, now yellow, had been trodden ragged.
<p/>Without this arrest of everything, this standing still of all the pale decayed objects, not even the withered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so like grave-clothes, or the long veil so like a shroud.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings and trimmings on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bridal dress, looking like earthy paper.
<p/>I knew nothing then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies buried in ancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of being distinctly seen; but, I have often thought since, that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must have looked as if the admission of the natural light of day would have struck her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to dust.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!'' said Estella with disdain, before our first game was out. '' And what coarse hands he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has!
<p/>I had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began to consider them a very indifferent pair.
<p/>And what thick boots! '' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) contempt for me was so strong, that it became infectious, and I caught it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) won the game, and I dealt.
<p/>I misdealt, as was only natural, when I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) denounced me for a stupid, clumsy laboring-boy.
<p/>'' You say nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>),'' remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looked on. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>).
<p/>What do you think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't like to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stammered. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me in my ear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham, bending down.
<p/>'' I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) is very proud,'' I replied, in a whisper. <div class="bookquote">``Anything else?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) is very pretty. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Anything else?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) is very insulting. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>-LRB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was looking at me then with a look of supreme aversion.-RRB-
<p/>'' Anything else?'' <div class="bookquote">``I think I should like to go home.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' And never see her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) again, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) is so pretty?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sure that I shouldn't like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) again, but I should like to go home now.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You shall go soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham, aloud.
<p/>Saving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost sure that Miss Havisham's face could not smile.
<p/>'' Play the game out. '' It had dropped into a watchful and brooding expression,--most likely when all the things about her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had become transfixed,--and
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) chest had dropped, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stooped; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) voice had dropped, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) spoke low, and with a dead lull upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>); altogether, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had the appearance of having dropped body and soul, within and without, under the weight of a crushing blow.
<p/>it looked as if nothing could ever lift it up again. I played the game to an end with Estella, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) beggared me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) threw the cards down on the table when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had won them all, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) despised them for having been won of me.
<p/>I was beginning to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) that to-day was Wednesday, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) checked me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) former impatient movement of the fingers of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) right hand.
<p/>'' When shall I have you here again?'' said Miss Havisham. <div class="bookquote">``Let me think. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' There, there! I know nothing of days of the week; I know nothing of weeks of the year.
<p/>Come again after six days. You hear?'' '' Yes, ma'am.'' '' Estella, take him (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) down. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) have something to eat, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) roam and look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) eats.
<p/>I followed the candle down, as I had followed the candle up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) stood it in the place where we had found it.
<p/>Go, Pip. '' Until she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) opened the side entrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it must necessarily be night-time.
<p/>The rush of the daylight quite confounded me, and made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strange room many hours.
<p/>'' You are to wait here, you boy,'' said Estella; and disappeared and closed the door. I took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my coarse hands and my common boots.
<p/>My opinion of those accessories was not favorable. They had never troubled me before, but they troubled me now, as vulgar appendages.
<p/>I determined to ask Joe why he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had ever taught me to call those picture-cards Jacks, which ought to be called knaves.
<p/>I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, and then I should have been so too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) put the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread and meat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog in disgrace.
<p/>I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,--I cannot hit upon the right name for the smart--God knows what its name was,--that tears started to my eyes.
<p/>The moment they sprang there, the girl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of them.
<p/>This gave me power to keep them back and to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>): so, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gave a contemptuous toss--but with a sense, I thought, of having made too sure that I was so wounded--and left me.
<p/>But when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my face in, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned my sleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried.
<p/>As I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair; so bitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name, that needed counteraction.
<p/>In the little world in which children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there is nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice.
<p/>It may be only small injustice that the child can be exposed to; but the child is small, and its world is small, and its rocking-horse stands as many hands high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter.
<p/>My sister's bringing up had made me sensitive. Within myself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with injustice.
<p/>I had known, from the time when I could speak, that my sister, in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me.
<p/>I had cherished a profound conviction that her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) bringing me up by hand gave her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) no right to bring me up by jerks.
<p/>Through all my punishments, disgraces, fasts, and vigils, and other penitential performances, I had nursed this assurance; and to my communing so much with it, in a solitary and unprotected way, I in great part refer the fact that I was morally timid and very sensitive.
<p/>I got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the brewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed my face with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate.
<p/>The bread and meat were acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soon in spirits to look about me.
<p/>To be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in the brewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high wind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if there had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it.
<p/>But there were no pigeons in the dove-cot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty, no malt in the storehouse,
<p/>no smells of grains and beer in the copper or the vat. All the uses and scents of the brewery might have evaporated with its last reek of smoke.
<p/>In a by-yard, there was a wilderness of empty casks, which had a certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about them; but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that was gone,--and in this respect
<p/>Behind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an old wall; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough to look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of the house, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there was a track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimes walked there, and that Estella was walking away from me even then.
<p/>For when I yielded to the temptation presented by the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) walking on them at the end of the yard of casks.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) back towards me, and held her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) pretty brown hair spread out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) two hands, and never looked round, and passed out of my view directly.
<p/>So, in the brewery itself,--by which I mean the large paved lofty place in which they used to make the beer, and where the brewing utensils still were.
<p/>When I first went into it, and, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near the door looking about me, I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) pass among the extinguished fires, and ascend some light iron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) were going out into the sky.
<p/>I remember those recluses as being like most others. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) seemed to be everywhere. It was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happened to my fancy.
<p/>I turned my eyes--a little dimmed by looking up at the frosty light--towards a great wooden beam in a low nook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure hanging there by the neck.
<p/>A figure all in yellow white, with but one shoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the faded trimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face was Miss Havisham's, with a movement going over the whole countenance as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) were trying to call to me.
<p/>In the terror of seeing the figure, and in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment before, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it.
<p/>I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it a stranger thing long afterwards. And my terror was greatest of all when I found no figure there.
<p/>Nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight of people passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the reviving influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would have brought me round.
<p/>Even with those aids, I might not have come to myself as soon as I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, to let me out.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I thought, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) saw me frightened; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would have no fair reason.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) rejoiced that my hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) opened the gate, and stood holding it.
<p/>I was passing out without looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) touched me with a taunting hand. '' Why don't you cry?
<p/>'' '' Because I don't want to.'' <div class="bookquote">``You do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>). '' You have been crying till you are half blind, and you are near crying again now.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate upon me. I went straight to Mr. Pumblechook's, and was immensely relieved to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) not at home.
<p/>So, leaving word with the shopman on what day I was wanted at Miss Havisham's again, I set off on the four-mile walk to our forge; pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply revolving that I was a common laboring-boy; that my hands were coarse; that my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit of calling knaves Jacks; that I was much more ignorant than I had considered myself last night, and generally that I was in a low-lived bad way.
<p/>When I reached home, my sister was very curious to know all about Miss Havisham's, and asked a number of questions.
<p/>And I soon found myself getting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the small of the back, and having my face ignominiously shoved against the kitchen wall, because I did not answer those questions at sufficient length.
<p/>If a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other young people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden in mine,--which
<p/>Chapter IX I consider probable, as I have no particular reason to suspect myself of having been a monstrosity,--it is the key to many reservations.
<p/>Not only that, but I felt convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood; and although she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained an impression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) really was -LRB-to say nothing of Miss Estella-RRB- before the contemplation of Mrs. Joe.
<p/>I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham's as my eyes had seen it, I should not be understood. Consequently, I said as little as I could, and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall.
<p/>The worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook, preyed upon by a devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard, came gaping over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) chaise-cart at tea-time, to have the details divulged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>).
<p/>And the mere sight of the torment, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) fishy eyes and mouth open, his (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) sandy hair inquisitively on end, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) waistcoat heaving with windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence.
<p/>'' Well, boy,'' Uncle Pumblechook began, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was seated in the chair of honor by the fire. ''
<p/>How did you get on up town? '' I answered, <div class="bookquote">``Pretty well, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and my sister shook her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) fist at me. ''
<p/>Pretty well? '' Mr. Pumblechook repeated. '' Pretty well is no answer. Tell us what you mean by pretty well, boy?''
<p/>Whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy perhaps. Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall on my forehead, my obstinacy was adamantine.
<p/>I reflected for some time, and then answered as if I had discovered a new idea, <div class="bookquote">``I mean pretty well. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>My sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,--I had no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge,--when
<p/>Mr. Pumblechook interposed with <div class="bookquote">``No! Don't lose your temper. Leave this lad to me, ma'am; leave this lad to me. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Pumblechook then turned me towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>), as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) were going to cut my hair, and said,-- ``First -LRB-to get our thoughts in order-RRB-
<p/>I calculated the consequences of replying <div class="bookquote">``Four Hundred Pound,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and finding them against me, went as near the answer as I could--which was somewhere about eightpence off.
<p/>Mr. Pumblechook then put me through my pence-table from <div class="bookquote">``twelve pence make one shilling,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>up to <div class="bookquote">``forty pence make three and fourpence,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and then triumphantly demanded, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had done for me, <div class="bookquote">``Now!
<p/>: Forty-three pence? ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>How much is forty-three pence?'' To which I replied, after a long interval of reflection, ``I don't know.
<p/>Mr. Pumblechook worked his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) head like a screw to screw it out of me, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Is forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens, for instance?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>And although my sister instantly boxed my ears, it was highly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) joke, and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) to a dead stop.
<p/>'' And I was so aggravated that I almost doubt if I did know. <div class="bookquote">``Yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. '' Boy! What like is Miss Havisham?
<p/>'' Mr. Pumblechook began again when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had recovered; folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) arms tight on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) chest and applying the screw. ''
<p/>Mr. Pumblechook winked assent; from which I at once inferred that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had never seen Miss Havisham, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was nothing of the kind.
<p/>Very tall and dark,'' I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>). '' Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), uncle?'' asked my sister. '' Good! '' said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly.
<p/>I am sure, uncle,'' returned Mrs. Joe, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you had him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) always; you know so well how to deal with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``This is the way to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)! We are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-RRB- '' <div class="bookquote">``Now, boy! What was she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) a doing of, when you went in today?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Pumblechook.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) was sitting,'' I answered, <div class="bookquote">``in a black velvet coach. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another--as they well might--and both repeated, <div class="bookquote">``In a black velvet coach?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``And Miss Estella--that's her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) niece , I think--handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) in cake and wine at the coach-window, on a gold plate.
<p/>And we all had cake and wine on gold plates. And I got up behind the coach to eat mine, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) told me to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was anybody else there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Pumblechook.

(<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Immense,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``And they fought for veal-cutlets out of a silver basket.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again, in utter amazement. I was perfectly frantic,--a reckless witness under the torture,--and would have told them anything.
<p/>'' Where was this coach, in the name of gracious?'' asked my sister. '' In Miss Havisham's room. '' They stared again.
<p/>I added this saving clause, in the moment of rejecting four richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts of harnessing.
<p/>'' But there weren't any horses to it. '' '' Can this be possible, uncle?'' asked Mrs. Joe. '' What can the boy mean?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll tell you, Mum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook. '' My opinion is, it's a sedan-chair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you ever see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) in it, uncle?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Joe. '' How could I,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) returned, forced to the admission, ``when I never see her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) in my life?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, don't you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, testily, <div class="bookquote">``that when I have been there, I have been took up to the outside of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) door, and the door has stood ajar, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) has spoke to me that way.

<p/>Howsever, the boy went there to play. What did you play at, boy?'' <div class="bookquote">``We played with flags,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. <div class="bookquote">``Flags! ''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>echoed my sister.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Estella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, and Miss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, out at the coach-window.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>Yes,'' said I. And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed. '' <div class="bookquote">``Swords!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>repeated my sister. '' Where did you get swords from?
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Out of a cupboard,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``And I saw pistols in it,--and jam,--and pills. And there was no daylight in the room, but it was all lighted up with candles.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>'' That's true, Mum,'' said Mr. Pumblechook, with a grave nod. '' That's the state of the case, for that much I've seen myself.
<p/>And then they both stared at me, and I, with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my countenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of my trousers with my right hand.
<p/>If they had asked me any more questions, I should undoubtedly have betrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning that there was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the statement but for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear in the brewery.
<p/>'' They were so much occupied, however, in discussing the marvels I had already presented for their consideration, that I escaped.
<p/>To whom my sister, more for the relief of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own mind than for the gratification of his (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), related my pretended experiences.
<p/>Now, when I saw Joe open his (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) blue eyes and roll them all round the kitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but only as regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>),--not in the least as regarded the other two.
<p/>Towards Joe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat debating what results would come to me from Miss Havisham's acquaintance and favor.
<p/>They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would <div class="bookquote">``do something''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>for me; their doubts related to the form that something would take.
<p/>The subject still held them when Joe came in from his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) work to have a cup of tea. My sister stood out for <div class="bookquote">``property.
<p/>Mr. Pumblechook was in favor of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel trade,--say, the corn and seed trade, for instance.
<p/>Joe fell into the deepest disgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that I might only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the veal-cutlets.
<p/>If a fool's head can't express better opinions than that,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said my sister, <div class="bookquote">``and you have got any work to do, you had better go and do it.
<p/>After Mr. Pumblechook had driven off, and when my sister was washing up, I stole into the forge to Joe, and remained by him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had done for the night.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>'' '' So he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) went. Then I said, <div class="bookquote">``Before the fire goes out, Joe, I should like to tell you something.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, taking hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twisting it between my finger and thumb, <div class="bookquote">``you remember all that about Miss Havisham's?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Should you, Pip?'' said Joe, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) shoeing-stool near the forge. '' Then tell us. What is it, Pip?'' <div class="bookquote">``Remember?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.
<p/>'' I believe you! Wonderful!'' '' It's a terrible thing, Joe; it ain't true. '' '' What are you telling of, Pip?
<p/>'' cried Joe, falling back in the greatest amazement. '' You don't mean to say it's-- '' '' Yes I do; it's lies, Joe.''
<p/>'' But not all of it? Why sure you don't mean to say, Pip, that there was no black welwet co--eh?
<p/>'' For, I stood shaking my head. '' But at least there was dogs, Pip? Come, Pip,'' said Joe, persuasively, <div class="bookquote">``if there warn't
<p/>no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>'' No, Joe. '' <div class="bookquote">``A dog?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. '' A puppy? Come?'' '' No, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind.
<p/>'' As I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay. '' Pip, old chap! This won't do, old fellow!
<p/>I say! Where do you expect to go to?'' '' It's terrible, Joe; ain't it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Terrible? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>cried Joe. <div class="bookquote">``Awful! What possessed you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know what possessed me, Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, letting his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) shirt sleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) feet, hanging my head;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but I wish you hadn't taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and I wish my boots weren't so thick nor my hands so coarse.
<p/>And then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn't been able to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude to me, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's who was dreadfully proud, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had said I was common, and that I knew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the lies had come of it somehow, though I didn't know how.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>This was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to deal with as for me. But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of metaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.
<p/>Howsever they come, they didn't ought to come, and they come from the father of lies, and work round to the same.
<p/>'' There's one thing you may be sure of, Pip,'' said Joe, after some rumination, <div class="bookquote">``namely, that lies is lies. Don't you tell no more of 'em, Pip.
<p/>That ain't the way to get out of being common, old chap. And as to being common, I don't make it out at all clear.
<p/>You are oncommon in some things. You're oncommon small. Likewise you're a oncommon scholar. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>'' No, I am ignorant and backward, Joe.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, see what a letter you wrote last night! Wrote in print even! I've seen letters--Ah! and from gentlefolks!--that I'll swear weren't wrote in print,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.
<p/>'' I have learnt next to nothing, Joe. You think much of me. It's only that.'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``be it so or be it son't
<p/>The king upon his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) throne, with his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) crown upon his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) ed, can't sit and write his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) acts of Parliament in print, without having begun, when he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) were a unpromoted Prince, with the alphabet.--Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>added Joe, with a shake of the head that was full of meaning, <div class="bookquote">``and begun at A too, and worked his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) way to Z.
<p/>, you must be a common scholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope! And I know what that is to do, though I can't say I've exactly done it.
<p/>Whether common ones as to callings and earnings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>pursued Joe, reflectively, <div class="bookquote">``mightn't be the better of continuing for to keep company with common ones,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>There was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouraged me. '' instead of going out to play with oncommon ones,--which reminds me to hope that there were a flag, perhaps?''
<p/>Whether that might be or mightn't be, is a thing as can't be looked into now, without putting your sister on the Rampage; and that's a thing not to be thought of as being done intentional.
<p/>'' No, Joe.'' '' -LRB-I'm sorry there weren't a flag, Pip-RRB-. Lookee here, Pip, at what is said to you by a true friend.
<p/>Which this to you the true friend say. If you can't get to be oncommon through going straight, you'll never get to do it through going crooked.
<p/>So don't tell no more on 'em, Pip, and live well and die happy.'' <div class="bookquote">``You are not angry with me, Joe?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay of a stunning and outdacious sort,--alluding to them which bordered on weal-cutlets and dog-fighting,--a
<p/>``No, old chap. sincere well-wisher would adwise, Pip, their being dropped into your meditations, when you go upstairs to bed. That's all, old chap, and don't never do it no more.
<p/>When I got up to my little room and said my prayers, I did not forget Joe's recommendation, and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and unthankful state,
<p/>that I thought long after I laid me down, how common Estella would consider Joe, a mere blacksmith; how thick his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) boots, and how coarse his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) hands.
<p/>I thought how Joe and my sister were then sitting in the kitchen, and how I had come up to bed from the kitchen, and how Miss Havisham and Estella never sat in a kitchen, but were far above the level of such common doings.
<p/>I fell asleep recalling what I <div class="bookquote">``used to do''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>when I was at Miss Havisham's; as though I had been there weeks or months, instead of hours; and as though it were quite an old subject of remembrance, instead of one that had arisen only that day.
<p/>'' That was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me. But it is the same with any life.
<p/>Pause you who read this, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold, of thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the formation of the first link on one memorable day.
<p/>The felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I woke, that the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was to get out of Biddy everything she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) knew.
<p/>In pursuance of this luminous conception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's at night, that I had a particular reason for wishing to get on in life, and that I should feel very much obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) would impart all her (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) learning to me.
<p/>Biddy, who was the most obliging of girls, immediately said she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) would, and indeed began to carry out her (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) promise within five minutes.
<p/>Imagine one selected day struck out of it, and think how different its course would have been. Chapter X The Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt may be resolved into the following synopsis.
<p/>The pupils ate apples and put straws down one another's backs, until Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt collected her (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with a birch-rod.
<p/>After receiving the charge with every mark of derision, the pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to hand.
<p/>The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and a little spelling,--that is to say, it had had once.
<p/>As soon as this volume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt fell into a state of coma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm.
<p/>The pupils then entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon whose toes.
<p/>This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a rush at them and distributed three defaced Bibles -LRB-shaped as if they had been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something-RRB-, more illegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature I have since met with, speckled all over with ironmould, and having various specimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves.
<p/>When the fights were over, Biddy gave out the number of a page, and then we all read aloud what we could,--or what we couldn't
<p/>This part of the Course was usually lightened by several single combats between Biddy and refractory students. --in a frightful chorus
<p/>; Biddy leading with a high, shrill, monotonous voice, and none of us having the least notion of, or reverence for, what we were reading about.
<p/>When this horrible din had lasted a certain time, it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt, who staggered at a boy fortuitously, and pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) ears.
<p/>This was understood to terminate the Course for the evening, and we emerged into the air with shrieks of intellectual victory.
<p/>It is fair to remark that there was no prohibition against any pupil's entertaining himself with a slate or even with the ink -LRB-when there was any-RRB-, but that it was not easy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season, on account of the little general shop in which the classes were holden--and which was also Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's sitting-room and bedchamber--being but faintly illuminated through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle and no snuffers.
<p/>It appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon, under these circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that very evening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting some information from her (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) little catalogue of Prices, under the head of moist sugar, and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English D which she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) had imitated from the heading of some newspaper, and which I supposed, until she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) told me what it was, to be a design for a buckle.
<p/>I had received strict orders from my sister to call for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) at the Three Jolly Bargemen, that evening, on my way from school, and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) home at my peril.
<p/>Of course there was a public-house in the village, and of course Joe liked sometimes to smoke his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pipe there. To the Three Jolly Bargemen, therefore, I directed my steps.
<p/>There was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen, with some alarmingly long chalk scores in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me to be never paid off.
<p/>But there was a quantity of chalk about our country, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it to account.
<p/>It being Saturday night, I found the landlord looking rather grimly at these records; but as my business was with Joe and not with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>), I merely wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) good evening, and passed into the common room at the end of the passage, where there was a bright large kitchen fire, and where Joe was smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and a stranger.
<p/>Joe greeted me as usual with <div class="bookquote">``Halloa, Pip, old chap!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) said that, the stranger turned his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) head and looked at me.
<p/>They had been there ever since I could remember, and had grown more than I had. He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) head was all on one side, and one of his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) eyes was half shut up, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) were taking aim at something with an invisible gun.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) had a pipe in his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) mouth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) smoke away and looking hard at me all the time, nodded.
<p/>So, I nodded, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) nodded again, and made room on the settle beside him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) that I might sit down there.
<p/>But as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of resort, I said <div class="bookquote">``No, thank you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and fell into the space Joe made for me on the opposite settle.
<p/>The strange man, after glancing at Joe, and seeing that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again when I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg--in a very odd way, as it struck me.
<p/>'' You was saying,'' said the strange man, turning to Joe, <div class="bookquote">``that you was a blacksmith. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. I said it, you know,'' said Joe.
<p/>'' What'll you drink, Mr.--? You didn't mention your name, by the bye. '' Joe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by it.
<p/>Well,'' said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``to tell you the truth, I ain't much in the habit of drinking at anybody's expense but my own.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What'll you drink, Mr. Gargery? At my expense? To top up with?'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Habit? No,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>returned the stranger, <div class="bookquote">``but once and away, and on a Saturday night too.
<p/>Come! Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't wish to be stiff company,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. <div class="bookquote">``Rum.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Rum,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>repeated the stranger.
<p/>'' And will the other gentleman originate a sentiment.'' <div class="bookquote">``Rum,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wopsle. '' Three Rums!'' cried the stranger, calling to the landlord.
<p/>This other gentleman,'' observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle, <div class="bookquote">``is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>Glasses round!'' '' Our clerk at church.'' <div class="bookquote">``Aha!''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) eye at me. '' The lonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!''
<p/>The stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) pipe, put his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) legs up on the settle that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had to himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) wore a flapping broad-brimmed traveller's hat, and under it a handkerchief tied over his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) head in the manner of a cap: so that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) showed no hair.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) looked at the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a half-laugh, come into his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) face.
<p/>'' That's it,'' said Joe. '' I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a solitary country towards the river.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Most marshes is solitary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. '' No doubt, no doubt. Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or vagrants of any sort, out there?''
<p/>'' No,'' said Joe; <div class="bookquote">``none but a runaway convict now and then. And we don't find them, easy. Eh, Mr. Wopsle?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented; but not warmly. '' Seems you have been out after such?
<p/>Not that we wanted to take them, you understand; we went out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip.
<p/>The stranger looked at me again,--still cocking his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) eye, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) were expressly taking aim at me with his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) invisible gun,--and said, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)'s a likely young parcel of bones that.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>asked the stranger. '' Once,'' returned Joe. '' Didn't us, Pip?'' '' Yes, Joe. '' What is it you call him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>)?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. '' Christened Pip?'' '' No, not christened Pip.'' <div class="bookquote">``Surname Pip?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>'' No,'' said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``it's a kind of family name what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) gave himself when a infant, and is called by.
<p/>Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in anywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at the Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was discussed over pipes,--<div class="bookquote">``well--no.
<p/>Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jolly Bargemen</b></font>)</div>said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) is not--no, not to deceive you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) is not--my nevvy.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Son of yours?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) ain't. '' <div class="bookquote">``Nevvy? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the strange man. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``What the Blue Blazes is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?
<p/>Mr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about relationships, having professional occasion to bear in mind what female relations a man might not marry; and expounded the ties between me and Joe.
<p/>Having his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling passage from Richard the Third, and seemed to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) had done quite enough to account for it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) added, '' (<font color='red'><b>the poet</b></font>)</div>--as the poet says.
<p/>And here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) considered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into my eyes.
<p/>I cannot conceive why everybody of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) standing who visited at our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory process under similar circumstances.
<p/>Yet I do not call to mind that I was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our social family circle, but some large-handed person took some such ophthalmic steps to patronize me.
<p/>All this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked at me as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring me down.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said nothing after offering his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Blue Blazes observation, until the glasses of rum and water were brought; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shot, and a most extraordinary shot it was.
<p/>'' asked the stranger. Which appeared to me to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength. '' It was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumb-show, and was pointedly addressed to me.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stirred it and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but with a file.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stirred his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rum and water pointedly at me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tasted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rum and water pointedly at me. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did this so that nobody
<p/>but I saw the file; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done it he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket.
<p/>I knew it to be Joe's file, and I knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew my convict, the moment I saw the instrument.
<p/>I sat gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), spell-bound. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now reclined on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) settle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principally about turnips.
<p/>There was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause before going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights, which stimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on Saturdays than at other times.
<p/>The half-hour and the rum and water running out together, Joe got up to go, and took me by the hand.
<p/>I think I've got a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket, and if I have, the boy shall have it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked it out from a handful of small change, folded it in some crumpled paper, and gave it to me.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop half a moment, Mr. Gargery,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the strange man. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Yours!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' Mind! Your own. '' I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) far beyond the bounds of good manners, and holding tight to Joe.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave Joe good-night, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave Mr. Wopsle good-night -LRB-who went out with us-RRB-, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave me only a look with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aiming eye,--no, not a look, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shut it up, but wonders may be done with an eye by hiding it.
<p/>On the way home, if I had been in a humor for talking, the talk must have been all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door of the Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) mouth wide open, to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible.
<p/>But I was in a manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old acquaintance, and could think of nothing else.
<p/>My sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in the kitchen, and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) about the bright shilling.
<p/>'' A bad un, I'll be bound,'' said Mrs. Joe triumphantly, <div class="bookquote">``or he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) wouldn't have given it to the boy! Let's look at it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>I took it out of the paper, and it proved to be a good one. '' But what's this?'' said Mrs. Joe, throwing down the shilling and catching up the paper.
<p/>Nothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed to have been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle-markets in the county.
<p/>'' Two One-Pound notes? '' Joe caught up his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) hat again, and ran with them to the Jolly Bargemen to restore them to their owner.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) was gone, I sat down on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister, feeling pretty sure that the man would not be there.
<p/>Presently, Joe came back, saying that the man was gone, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Joe, had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes.
<p/>Then my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper, and put them under some dried rose-leaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in the state parlor.
<p/>I had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of the strange man taking aim at me with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) invisible gun, and of the guiltily coarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of conspiracy with convicts,--a feature in my low career that I had previously forgotten.
<p/>There they remained, a nightmare to me, many and many a night and day. I was haunted by the file too.
<p/>I coaxed myself to sleep by thinking of Miss Havisham's, next Wednesday; and in my sleep I saw the file coming at me out of a door, without seeing who held it, and I screamed myself awake.
<p/>A dread possessed me that when I least expected it, the file would reappear. Chapter XI At the appointed time I returned to Miss Havisham's, and my hesitating ring at the gate brought out Estella.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) locked it after admitting me, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had done before, and again preceded me into the dark passage where her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) candle stood.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) took no notice of me until she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had the candle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looked over her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) shoulder, superciliously saying, <div class="bookquote">``You are to come this way to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and took me to quite another part of the house.
<p/>We traversed but one side of the square, however, and at the end of it she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) stopped, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) candle down and opened a door.
<p/>Here, the daylight reappeared, and I found myself in a small paved courtyard, the opposite side of which was formed by a detached dwelling-house, that looked as if it had once belonged to the manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery.
<p/>The passage was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole square basement of the Manor House. There was a clock in the outer wall of this house.
<p/>We went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with a low ceiling, on the ground-floor at the back.
<p/>There was some company in the room, and Estella said to me as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) joined it, <div class="bookquote">``You are to go and stand there boy, till you are wanted.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Like the clock in Miss Havisham's room, and like Miss Havisham's watch, it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine. <div class="bookquote">``There'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>, being the window, I crossed to it, and stood <div class="bookquote">``there,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>in a very uncomfortable state of mind, looking out.
<p/>It opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner of the neglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbage-stalks, and one box-tree that had been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and had a new growth at the top of it, out of shape and of a different color, as if that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt.
<p/>There had been some light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge; but, it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden, and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the window, as if it pelted me for coming there.
<p/>This was my homely thought, as I contemplated the box-tree. I divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room, and that its other occupants were looking at me.
<p/>I could see nothing of the room except the shining of the fire in the window-glass, but I stiffened in all my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection.
<p/>Before I had been standing at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me that they were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretended not to know that the others were toadies and humbugs: because the admission that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) or she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) did know it, would have made him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) out to be a toady and humbug.
<p/>They all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody's pleasure, and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to repress a yawn.
<p/>This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much reminded me of my sister, with the difference that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was older, and -LRB-as I found when I caught sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)-RRB- of a blunter cast of features.
<p/>There were three ladies in the room and one gentleman. Indeed, when I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) better I began to think it was a Mercy
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had any features at all, so very blank and high was the dead wall of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) face. '' Poor dear soul!'' said this lady, with an abruptness of manner quite my sister's.
<p/>'' Nobody's enemy but his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own!'' <div class="bookquote">``It would be much more commendable to be somebody else's enemy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman; <div class="bookquote">``far more natural.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cousin Raymond,''  (<font color='red'><b>another lady</b></font>)</div>observed another lady, <div class="bookquote">``we are to love our neighbor.''  (<font color='red'><b>another lady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sarah Pocket,''  (<font color='red'><b>Raymond/Cousin Raymond</b></font>)</div>returned Cousin Raymond, <div class="bookquote">``if a man is not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own neighbor, who is?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Raymond/Cousin Raymond</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said -LRB-checking a yawn-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``The idea! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div>But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good idea too.
<p/>Camilla presently went on -LRB-I knew they had all been looking at me in the mean time-RRB-, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is so very strange!
<p/>Would anyone believe that when Tom's wife died, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) actually could not be induced to see the importance of the children's having the deepest of trimmings to their mourning? '
<p/>The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and emphatically, <div class="bookquote">``Very true!''  (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Poor soul! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>Good Lord!' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), `Camilla, what can it signify so long as the poor bereaved little things are in black?'
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good points in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), good points in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Raymond/Cousin Raymond</b></font>)</div>said Cousin Raymond; <div class="bookquote">``Heaven forbid I should deny good points in him (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) never had, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) never will have, any sense of the proprieties.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Raymond/Cousin Raymond</b></font>)</div><p/>So like Matthew! The idea!'' '' You know I was obliged,'' said Camilla,--<div class="bookquote">``I was obliged to be firm. I said, `It WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family.'
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) that, without deep trimmings, the family was disgraced. I cried about it from breakfast till dinner. I injured my digestion.
<p/>Thank Goodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly went out in a pouring rain and bought the things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div><p/>And at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) flung out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) violent way, and said, with a D, `Then do as you like.' ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) paid for them, did he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) not?'' asked Estella. '' It's not the question, my dear child, who paid for them,'' returned Camilla.
<p/>'' I bought them. And I shall often think of that with peace, when I wake up in the night. ''
<p/>The ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry or call along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the conversation and caused Estella to say to me, <div class="bookquote">``Now, boy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>On my turning round, they all looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I went out, I heard Sarah Pocket say, <div class="bookquote">``Well I am sure!
<p/>As we were going with our candle along the dark passage, Estella stopped all of a sudden, and, facing round, said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) taunting manner, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) face quite close to mine,--
<p/>What next!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah Pocket/Sarah/Miss Sarah Pocket</b></font>)</div>and Camilla add, with indignation, <div class="bookquote">``Was there ever such a fancy! The i-de-a!''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, miss? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, almost falling over her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) and checking myself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) stood looking at me, and, of course, I stood looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>). '' Am I pretty?'' '' Yes; I think you are very pretty.
<p/>'' '' Am I insulting?'' <div class="bookquote">``Not so much so as you were last time ,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Not so much so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) fired when she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) asked the last question, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) slapped my face with such force as she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had, when I answered it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Now?'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>). '' You little coarse monster, what do you think of me now?'' <div class="bookquote">``I shall not tell you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Because you are going to tell upstairs. Is that it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' No,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``that's not it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you cry again, you little wretch?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Because I'll never cry for you again,'' said I. Which was, I suppose, as false a declaration as ever was made; for I was inwardly crying for her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) then, and I know what I know of the pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) cost me afterwards.
<p/>We went on our way upstairs after this episode; and, as we were going up, we met a gentleman groping his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) way down.
<p/>'' '' Whom have we here? '' asked the gentleman, stopping and looking at me. '' A boy,'' said Estella. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion, with an exceedingly large head, and a corresponding large hand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took my chin in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the light of the candle.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was prematurely bald on the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head, and had bushy black eyebrows that wouldn't lie down but stood up bristling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had a large watch-chain, and strong black dots where his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) beard and whiskers would have been if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had let them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was nothing to me, and I could have had no foresight then, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ever would be anything to me, but it happened that I had this opportunity of observing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) well.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes were set very deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head, and were disagreeably sharp and suspicious. '' Boy of the neighborhood? Hey?'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>).
<p/>'' Yes, sir,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``How do you come here?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Miss Havisham sent for me, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I explained. '' Well! Behave yourself.
<p/>I have a pretty large experience of boys, and you're a bad set of fellows. Now mind! '' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>), biting the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) great forefinger as he (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) frowned at me, <div class="bookquote">``you behave yourself!
<p/>With those words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) released me--which I was glad of, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) hand smelt of scented soap--and went his (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) way downstairs.
<p/>I wondered whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) could be a doctor; but no, I thought; he (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) couldn't be a doctor, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Boy</b></font>) would have a quieter and more persuasive manner.
<p/>There was not much time to consider the subject, for we were soon in Miss Havisham's room, where she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) and everything else were just as I had left them.
<p/>Estella left me standing near the door, and I stood there until Miss Havisham cast her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) eyes upon me from the dressing-table.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' So! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said, without being startled or surprised: <div class="bookquote">``the days have worn away, have they?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, ma'am.
<p/>To-day is--'' <div class="bookquote">``There, there, there!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>with the impatient movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) fingers. '' I don't want to know. Are you ready to play?
<p/>'' I was obliged to answer in some confusion, <div class="bookquote">``I don't think I am, ma'am. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at cards again? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>boy</b></font>)</div><p/>Since this house strikes you old and grave, boy,'' said Miss Havisham, impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``and you are unwilling to play, are you willing to work?
<p/>I could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to find for the other question, and I said I was quite willing.
<p/>Then go into that opposite room,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), pointing at the door behind me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) withered hand, <div class="bookquote">``and wait there till I come.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) demanded, with a searching look. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Yes, ma'am; I could do that, if I was wanted.'' '' '' '' ''
<p/>I crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) indicated. From that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it had an airless smell that was oppressive.
<p/>A fire had been lately kindled in the damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out than to burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed colder than the clearer air,--like our own marsh mist.
<p/>Certain wintry branches of candles on the high chimney-piece faintly lighted the chamber; or it would be more expressive to say, faintly troubled its darkness.
<p/>It was spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but every discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould, and dropping to pieces.
<p/>The most prominent object was a long table with a tablecloth spread on it, as if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all stopped together.
<p/>An epergne or centre-piece of some kind was in the middle of this cloth; it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable; and, as I looked along the yellow expanse out of which I remember its seeming to grow, like a black fungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders with blotchy bodies running home to it, and running out from it, as if some circumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in the spider community.
<p/>But the black beetles took no notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a ponderous elderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard of hearing, and not on terms with one another.
<p/>These crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watching them from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) other hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had a crutch-headed stick on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) leaned, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) looked like the Witch of the place.
<p/>This,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), pointing to the long table with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stick, <div class="bookquote">``is where I will be laid when I am dead.
<p/>I heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same occurrence were important to their interests. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>They shall come and look at me here.
<p/>With some vague misgiving that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) might get upon the table then and there and die at once, the complete realization of the ghastly waxwork at the Fair, I shrank under her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) touch.
<p/>'' '' What do you think that is? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) asked me, again pointing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stick; <div class="bookquote">``that, where those cobwebs are?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said, leaning on me while her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) hand twitched my shoulder, ``Come, come, come!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't guess what it is, ma'am.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' It's a great cake. A bride-cake. Mine! '' Walk me, walk me! ''
<p/>I made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss Havisham round and round the room.
<p/>Accordingly, I started at once, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have been an imitation -LRB-founded on my first impulse under that roof-RRB- of Mr. Pumblechook's chaise-cart.
<p/>Still, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) twitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) mouth, and led me to believe that we were going fast because her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) thoughts went fast.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was not physically strong, and after a little time said, <div class="bookquote">``Slower!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>After a while she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Call Estella!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>so I went out on the landing and roared that name as I had done on the previous occasion.
<p/>If only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I should have felt sufficiently discontented; but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) brought with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) the three ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didn't know what to do.
<p/>In my politeness, I would have stopped; but Miss Havisham twitched my shoulder, and we posted on,--with a shame-faced consciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing.
<p/>When her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) light appeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again round and round the room. '' Dear Miss Havisham,'' said Miss Sarah Pocket.
<p/>Camilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) murmured, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham, <div class="bookquote">``Poor dear soul!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>How well you look!'' <div class="bookquote">``I do not,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>returned Miss Havisham. '' I am yellow skin and bone. '' Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor thing.
<p/>As we were close to Camilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only Miss Havisham wouldn't stop.
<p/>The idea!'' '' And how are you?'' said Miss Havisham to Camilla. We swept on, and I felt that I was highly obnoxious to Camilla.
<p/>'' Thank you, Miss Havisham,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``I am as well as can be expected. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, what's the matter with you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Havisham, with exceeding sharpness.
<p/>I don't wish to make a display of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more in the night than I am quite equal to.''
<p/>Very easily said!'' remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob, while a hitch came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) upper lip, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) tears overflowed.
<p/>'' Nothing worth mentioning,'' replied Camilla. '' '' Then don't think of me,'' retorted Miss Havisham. '' '' Raymond is a witness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night.
<p/>Raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs. Chokings and nervous jerkings, however, are nothing new to me when I think with anxiety of those I love.
<p/>If I could be less affectionate and sensitive, I should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves. I am sure I wish it could be so.
<p/>But as to not thinking of you in the night--The idea! '' Here, a burst of tears. The Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, and him (<font color='blue'><b>Raymond</b></font>) I understood to be Mr. Camilla.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) came to the rescue at this point, and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice, <div class="bookquote">``Camilla, my dear, it is well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not aware,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but once, ``that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that person, my dear.
<p/>Miss Sarah Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry, brown, corrugated old woman, with a small face that might have been made of walnut-shells, and a large mouth like a cat's without the whiskers, supported this position by saying, <div class="bookquote">``No, indeed, my dear.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a cat</b></font>)</div>Hem!'' <div class="bookquote">``Thinking is easy enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the grave lady. '' What is easier, you know? '' assented Miss Sarah Pocket.
<p/>'' Oh, yes, yes!'' cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared to rise from her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) legs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) bosom. '' It's all very true!
<p/>No doubt my health would be much better if it was otherwise, still I wouldn't change my disposition if I could.
<p/>It's the cause of much suffering, but it's a consolation to know I posses it, when I wake up in the night.
<p/>Miss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept going round and round the room; now brushing against the skirts of the visitors, now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber.
<p/>It's a weakness to be so affectionate, but I can't help it. '' Here another burst of feeling. '' There's Matthew!'' said Camilla.
<p/>I have taken to the sofa with my staylace cut, and have lain there hours insensible, with my head over the side, and my hair all down, and my feet
<p/>'' Never mixing with any natural ties, never coming here to see how Miss Havisham is! I don't know where-- '' -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Much higher than your head, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Camilla.-RRB-
<p/>I have gone off into that state, hours and hours, on account of Matthew's strange and inexplicable conduct, and nobody has thanked me.''
<p/>You see, my dear,'' added Miss Sarah Pocket -LRB-a blandly vicious personage-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``the question to put to yourself is, who did you expect to thank you, my love?''
 (<font color='red'><b>a personage</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Without expecting any thanks, or anything of the sort,''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div>resumed Camilla, <div class="bookquote">``I have remained in that state, hours and hours, and Raymond is a witness of the extent to which I have choked, and what the total inefficacy of ginger has been, and I have been heard at the piano-forte tuner's across the street, where the poor mistaken children have even supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance,--and now to be told--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div>Here Camilla put her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) throat, and began to be quite chemical as to the formation of new combinations there.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Really I must say I should think not! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>interposed the grave lady. '' When this same Matthew was mentioned, Miss Havisham stopped me and herself, and stood looking at the speaker.
<p/>This change had a great influence in bringing Camilla's chemistry to a sudden end. '' Matthew will come and see me at last,'' said Miss Havisham, sternly, <div class="bookquote">``when I am laid on that table.
<p/>That will be his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) place,--there,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>striking the table with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stick, <div class="bookquote">``at my head! And yours will be there! And your husband's there!
<p/>And Sarah Pocket's there! And Georgiana's there! Now you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me.
<p/>And now go! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>At the mention of each name, she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had struck the table with her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) stick in a new place.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) now said, <div class="bookquote">``Walk me, walk me!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and we went on again. '' I suppose there's nothing to be done,'' exclaimed Camilla, ``but comply and depart.
<p/>It's something to have seen the object of one's love and duty for even so short a time. I shall think of it with a melancholy satisfaction when I wake up in the night.
<p/>I am determined not to make a display of my feelings, but it's very hard to be told one wants to feast on one's relations,--as if one was a Giant,--and to be told to go.
<p/>Mr. Camilla interposing, as Mrs. Camilla laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) heaving bosom, that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which I supposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of view, and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) hand to Miss Havisham, was escorted forth.
<p/>Sarah Pocket and Georgiana contended who should remain last; but Sarah was too knowing to be outdone, and ambled round Georgiana with that artful slipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence.
<p/>Sarah Pocket then made her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) separate effect of departing with, <div class="bookquote">``Bless you, Miss Havisham dear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah Pocket/Sarah/Miss Sarah Pocket</b></font>)</div>and with a smile of forgiving pity on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) walnut-shell countenance for the weaknesses of the rest.
<p/>While Estella was away lighting them down, Miss Havisham still walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) hand on my shoulder, but more and more slowly.
<p/>I wish Matthew could have that comfort, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) sets it at defiance. The bare idea! '' At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stopped before the fire, and said, after muttering and looking at it some seconds,--
<p/>'' This is my birthday, Pip. '' I was going to wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) many happy returns, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stick.
<p/>'' I don't suffer it to be spoken of. I don't suffer those who were here just now, or any one to speak of it.
<p/>They come here on the day, but they dare not refer to it. '' Of course I made no further effort to refer to it.
<p/>On this day of the year, long before you were born, this heap of decay,'' stabbing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the table, but not touching it, <div class="bookquote">``was brought here.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It and I have worn away together. The mice have gnawed at it, and sharper teeth than teeth of mice have gnawed at me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) held the head of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stick against her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) heart as she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stood looking at the table; she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) once white dress, all yellow and withered; the once white cloth all yellow and withered; everything around in a state to crumble under a touch.
<p/>When the ruin is complete,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), with a ghastly look, <div class="bookquote">``and when they lay me dead, in my bride's dress on the bride's table,--which shall be done, and which will be the finished curse upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>),--so much the better if it is done on this day!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) stood looking at the table as if she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) stood looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) own figure lying there. I remained quiet.
<p/>In the heavy air of the room, and the heavy darkness that brooded in its remoter corners, I even had an alarming fancy that Estella and I might presently begin to decay.
<p/>At length, not coming out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) distraught state by degrees, but in an instant, Miss Havisham said, <div class="bookquote">``Let me see you two play cards; why have you not begun?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div><p/>With that, we returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) room, and sat down as before; I was beggared, as before; and again, as before, Miss Havisham watched us all the time, directed my attention to Estella's beauty, and made me notice it the more by trying her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) jewels on Estella's breast and hair.
<p/>Estella returned, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) too remained quiet. It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time. Estella, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) part, likewise treated me as before, except that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) did not condescend to speak.
<p/>When we had played some half-dozen games, a day was appointed for my return, and I was taken down into the yard to be fed in the former dog-like manner.
<p/>It is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which I had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was, on that last occasion, open or shut.
<p/>There, too, I was again left to wander about as I liked. Enough that I saw no gate then, and that I saw one now.
<p/>As it stood open, and as I knew that Estella had let the visitors out,--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had returned with the keys in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand,--I strolled into the garden, and strolled all over it.
<p/>It was quite a wilderness, and there were old melon-frames and cucumber-frames in it, which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots, with now and then a weedy offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan.
<p/>When I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but a fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles, I found myself in the dismal corner upon which I had looked out of the window.
<p/>Never questioning for a moment that the house was now empty, I looked in at another window, and found myself, to my great surprise, exchanging a broad stare with a pale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) books when I had found myself staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and I now saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was inky.
<p/>This pale young gentleman quickly disappeared, and reappeared beside me. <div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``young fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Halloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to be best answered by itself, I said, <div class="bookquote">``Halloa!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>politely omitting young fellow. '' Who let you in?'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). '' Miss Estella. '' <div class="bookquote">``Who gave you leave to prowl about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Estella. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come and fight,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the pale young gentleman. What could I do but follow him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)? I have often asked myself the question since; but what else could I do?
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) manner was so final, and I was so astonished, that I followed where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) led, as if I had been under a spell.
<p/>'' Stop a minute, though,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, wheeling round before we had gone many paces. '' I ought to give you a reason for fighting, too.
<p/>In a most irritating manner he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) instantly slapped his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands against one another, daintily flung one of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) legs up behind him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), pulled my hair, slapped his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hands again, dipped his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head, and butted it into my stomach.
<p/>The bull-like proceeding last mentioned, besides that it was unquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty, was particularly disagreeable just after bread and meat.
<p/>There it is!'' I therefore hit out at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) and was going to hit out again, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Aha! Would you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled within my limited experience.
<p/>'' Laws of the game!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). Here, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) skipped from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) left leg on to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) right. '' Regular rules!
<p/>'' Here, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) skipped from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) right leg on to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) left. <div class="bookquote">``Come to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!
<p/>I was secretly afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) when I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) so dexterous; but I felt morally and physically convinced that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) light head of hair could have had no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right to consider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention.
<p/>Therefore, I followed him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dodged backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things while I looked helplessly at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). On his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) asking me if I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying
<p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) begged my leave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returned with a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar.
<p/>And then fell to pulling off, not only his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) jacket and waistcoat, but his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) shirt too, in a manner at once light-hearted, business-like, and bloodthirsty.
<p/>'' Available for both,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, placing these against the wall. Although he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did not look very healthy,--having pimples on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face, and a breaking out at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mouth,--these dreadful preparations quite appalled me.
<p/>I judged him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to be about my own age, but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was much taller, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance.
<p/>For the rest, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a young gentleman in a gray suit -LRB-when not denuded for battle-RRB-, with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably in advance of the rest of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) as to development.
<p/>My heart failed me when I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) squaring at me with every demonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) were minutely choosing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bone.
<p/>I never have been so surprised in my life, as I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back, looking up at me with a bloody nose and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face exceedingly fore-shortened.
<p/>The second greatest surprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back again, looking up at me out of a black eye.
<p/>But, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) feet directly, and after sponging himself with a great show of dexterity began squaring again. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spirit inspired me with great respect.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) seemed to have no strength, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) never once hit me hard, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was always knocked down; but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or drinking out of the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself according to form, and then came at me with an air and a show that made me believe he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) really was going to do for me at last.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) got heavily bruised, for I am sorry to record that the more I hit him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), the harder I hit him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) came up again and again and again, until at last he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) got a bad fall with the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head against the wall.
<p/>Even after that crisis in our affairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) got up and turned round and round confusedly a few times, not knowing where I was; but finally went on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knees to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sponge and threw it up: at the same time panting out,
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed the contest, I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory.
<p/>Indeed, I go so far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species of savage young wolf or other wild beast.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That means you have won. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>However, I got dressed, darkly wiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, <div class="bookquote">``Can I help you?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``No thankee,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and I said <div class="bookquote">``Good afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``Same to you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>When I got into the courtyard, I found Estella waiting with the keys.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) neither asked me where I had been, nor why I had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) waiting; and there was a bright flush upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) face, as though something had happened to delight her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>).
<p/>Instead of going straight to the gate, too, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) stepped back into the passage, and beckoned me. <div class="bookquote">``Come here! You may kiss me, if you like.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) cheek as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) turned it to me. I think I would have gone through a great deal to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) cheek.
<p/>But I felt that the kiss was given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been, and that it was worth nothing.
<p/>What with the birthday visitors, and what with the cards, and what with the fight, my stay had lasted so long, that when I neared home the light on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against a black night-sky, and Joe's furnace was flinging a path of fire across the road.
<p/>The more I thought of the fight, and recalled the pale young gentleman on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance, the more certain it appeared that something would be done to me.
<p/>Chapter XII My mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman. I felt that the pale young gentleman's blood was on my head, and that the Law would avenge it.
<p/>Without having any definite idea of the penalties I had incurred, it was clear to me that village boys could not go stalking about the country, ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and pitching into the studious youth of England, without laying themselves open to severe punishment.
<p/>For some days, I even kept close at home, and looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution and trepidation before going on an errand, lest the officers of the County Jail should pounce upon me.
<p/>The pale young gentleman's nose had stained my trousers, and I tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night.
<p/>I had cut my knuckles against the pale young gentleman's teeth, and I twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles, as I devised incredible ways of accounting for that damnatory circumstance when I should be haled before the Judges.
<p/>When the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of violence, my terrors reached their height.
<p/>Whether myrmidons of Justice, specially sent down from London, would be lying in ambush behind the gate;--whether Miss Havisham, preferring to take personal vengeance for an outrage done to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) house, might rise in those grave-clothes of hers, draw a pistol, and shoot me dead:--whether suborned boys--a numerous band of mercenaries--might be engaged to fall upon me in the brewery, and cuff me until I was no more;--it was high testimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale young gentleman, that I never imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) accessory to these retaliations; they always came into my mind as the acts of injudicious relatives of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), goaded on by the state of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) visage and an indignant sympathy with the family features.
<p/>However, go to Miss Havisham's I must, and go I did. And behold! nothing came of the late struggle. It was not alluded to in any way, and no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises.
<p/>I found the same gate open, and I explored the garden, and even looked in at the windows of the detached house; but my view was suddenly stopped by the closed shutters within, and all was lifeless.
<p/>Only in the corner where the combat had taken place could I detect any evidence of the young gentleman's existence. There were traces of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gore in that spot, and I covered them with garden-mould from the eye of man.
<p/>On the broad landing between Miss Havisham's own room and that other room in which the long table was laid out, I saw a garden-chair,--a light chair on wheels, that you pushed from behind.
<p/>It had been placed there since my last visit, and I entered, that same day, on a regular occupation of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair -LRB-when she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was tired of walking with her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) hand upon my shoulder-RRB- round her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) own room, and across the landing, and round the other room.
<p/>Over and over and over again, we would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last as long as three hours at a stretch.
<p/>I insensibly fall into a general mention of these journeys as numerous, because it was at once settled that I should return every alternate day at noon for these purposes, and because I am now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten months.
<p/>As we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more to me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was I going to be?
<p/>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, I believed; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything, in the hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) might offer some help towards that desirable end.
<p/>Neither did she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) ever give me any money,--or anything but my daily dinner,--nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my services.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) did not; on the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) seemed to prefer my being ignorant. Estella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told me
<p/>Sometimes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would coldly tolerate me; sometimes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would condescend to me; sometimes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would be quite familiar with me; sometimes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would tell me energetically that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hated me.
<p/>Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we were alone, <div class="bookquote">``Does she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) grow prettier and prettier, Pip?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Also, when we played at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish of Estella's moods, whatever they were.
<p/>And sometimes, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) moods were so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled what to say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) with lavish fondness, murmuring something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) ear that sounded like <div class="bookquote">``Break their hearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>I might kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) again. And when I said yes -LRB-for indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) did-RRB-, would seem to enjoy it greedily. There was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which the burden was Old Clem.
<p/>This was not a very ceremonious way of rendering homage to a patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood in that relation towards smiths.
<p/>It was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of Old Clem's respected name.
<p/>Thus, you were to hammer boys round--Old Clem! With a thump and a sound--Old Clem! Beat it out, beat it out--Old Clem!
<p/>One day soon after the appearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly saying to me, with the impatient movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clem</b></font>) fingers, <div class="bookquote">``There, there, there!
<p/>With a clink for the stout--Old Clem! Blow the fire, blow the fire--Old Clem! Roaring dryer, soaring higher--Old Clem! Sing! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>It happened so to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Clem</b></font>) fancy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clem</b></font>) took it up in a low brooding voice as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clem</b></font>) were singing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clem</b></font>) sleep.
<p/>After that, it became customary with us to have it as we moved about, and Estella would often join in; though the whole strain was so subdued, even when there were three of us, that it made less noise in the grim old house than the lightest breath of wind.
<p/>I was surprised into crooning this ditty as I pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) over the floor. What could I become with these surroundings?
<p/>Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were dazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the natural light from the misty yellow rooms?
<p/>Perhaps I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman, if I had not previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which I had confessed.
<p/>Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardly fail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passenger to be put into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>).
<p/>Besides, that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estella discussed, which had come upon me in the beginning, grew much more potent as time went on.
<p/>How could my character fail to be influenced by them? I reposed complete confidence in no one but Biddy; but I told poor Biddy everything.
<p/>Why it came natural to me to do so, and why Biddy had a deep concern in everything I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), I did not know then, though I think I know now.
<p/>That ass, Pumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose of discussing my prospects with my sister; and I really do believe -LRB-to this hour with less penitence than I ought to feel-RRB-, that if these hands could have taken a linchpin out of his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) chaise-cart, they would have done it.
<p/>The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of mind, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not discuss my prospects without having me before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--as it were, to operate upon,--and
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would drag me up from my stool -LRB-usually by the collar-RRB- where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting me before the fire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying, ``Now, Mum, here is this boy!
<p/>Meanwhile, councils went on in the kitchen at home, fraught with almost insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit. Here is this boy which you brought up by hand.
<p/>Hold up your head, boy, and be forever grateful unto them which so did do. Now, Mum, with respections to this boy!
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would rumple my hair the wrong way,--which from my earliest remembrance, as already hinted, I have in my soul denied the right of any fellow-creature to do,--and would hold me before him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) by the sleeve,--a spectacle of imbecility only to be equalled by himself.
<p/>Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations about Miss Havisham, and about what she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) would do with me and for me, that I used to want--quite painfully--to burst into spiteful tears, fly at Pumblechook, and pummel him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) all over.
<p/>In these dialogues, my sister spoke to me as if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at every reference; while Pumblechook himself, self-constituted my patron, would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of my fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) was often talked at, while they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe's perceiving that he (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) was not favorable to my being taken from the forge.
<p/>I was fully old enough now to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker on his (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my sister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition on his (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) part, that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would dive at him (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>), take the poker out of his (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>) hands, shake him (<font color='blue'><b>architect</b></font>), and put it away.
<p/>All in a moment, with nothing to lead up to it, my sister would stop herself in a yawn, and catching sight of me as it were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, <div class="bookquote">``Come!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>In these discussions, Joe bore no part. There was a most irritating end to every one of these debates. there's enough of you!
<p/>You get along to bed; you've given trouble enough for one night, I hope! '' As if I had besought them as a favor to bother my life out.
<p/>We went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that we should continue to go on in this way for a long time, when one day Miss Havisham stopped short as she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) and I were walking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) leaning on my shoulder; and said with some displeasure,--
<p/>I thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look, that this might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no control.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) said no more at the time; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) presently stopped and looked at me again; and presently again; and after that, looked frowning and moody.
<p/>On the next day of my attendance, when our usual exercise was over, and I had landed her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) dressing-table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stayed me with a movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) impatient fingers:--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are growing tall, Pip!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Joe Gargery, ma'am.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes, Miss Havisham.'' <div class="bookquote">``You had better be apprenticed at once. Would Gargery come here with you, and bring your indentures, do you think?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I signified that I had no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would take it as an honor to be asked. '' Then let him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) come.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any particular time, Miss Havisham?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' There, there! I know nothing about times. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) come soon, and come along with you.
<p/>When I got home at night, and delivered this message for Joe, my sister <div class="bookquote">``went on the Rampage,''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>in a more alarming degree than at any previous period.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) asked me and Joe whether we supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was door-mats under our feet, and how we dared to use her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) so, and what company we graciously thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was fit for?
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had exhausted a torrent of such inquiries, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) threw a candlestick at Joe, burst into a loud sobbing, got out the dustpan,--which was always a very bad sign,--put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) coarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible extent.
<p/>Not satisfied with a dry cleaning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) took to a pail and scrubbing-brush, and cleaned us out of house and home, so that we stood shivering in the back-yard.
<p/>It was ten o'clock at night before we ventured to creep in again, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) asked Joe why he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) hadn't married a Negress Slave at once?
<p/>Joe offered no answer, poor fellow, but stood feeling his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) whisker and looking dejectedly at me, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) thought it really might have been a better speculation.
<p/>'' Chapter XIII It was a trial to my feelings, on the next day but one, to see Joe arraying himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) Sunday clothes to accompany me to Miss Havisham's.
<p/>However, as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) court-suit necessary to the occasion, it was not for me to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) looked far better in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) working-dress; the rather, because I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) made himself so dreadfully uncomfortable, entirely on my account, and that it was for me he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) pulled up his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) shirt-collar so very high behind, that it made the hair on the crown of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) head
<p/>At breakfast-time my sister declared her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) intention of going to town with us, and being left at Uncle Pumblechook's and called for <div class="bookquote">``when we had done with our fine ladies'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>--a way of putting the case, from which Joe appeared inclined to augur the worst.
<p/>The forge was shut up for the day, and Joe inscribed in chalk upon the door -LRB-as it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) custom to do on the very rare occasions when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was not at work-RRB- the monosyllable HOUT, accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the direction he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had taken.
<p/>We walked to town, my sister leading the way in a very large beaver bonnet, and carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England in plaited Straw, a pair of pattens, a spare shawl, and an umbrella, though it was a fine bright day.
<p/>I am not quite clear whether these articles were carried penitentially or ostentatiously; but I rather think they were displayed as articles of property,--much as Cleopatra or any other sovereign lady on the Rampage might exhibit her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) wealth in a pageant or procession.
<p/>stand up like a tuft of feathers. When we came to Pumblechook's, my sister bounced in and left us. As it was almost noon, Joe and I held straight on to Miss Havisham's house.
<p/>Estella opened the gate as usual, and, the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) appeared, Joe took his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hands; as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had some urgent reason in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) mind for being particular to half a quarter of an ounce.
<p/>Estella took no notice of either of us, but led us the way that I knew so well. I followed next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), and Joe came last.
<p/>When I looked back at Joe in the long passage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was still weighing his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hat with the greatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) toes.
<p/>Estella told me we were both to go in, so I took Joe by the coat-cuff and conducted him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) into Miss Havisham's presence.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was seated at her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) dressing-table, and looked round at us immediately. '' Oh!'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) to Joe. '' You are the husband of the sister of this boy?
<p/>like some extraordinary bird; standing as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did speechless, with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tuft of feathers ruffled, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mouth open as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wanted a worm.
<p/>'' I could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself or so '' You are the husband,'' repeated Miss Havisham, <div class="bookquote">``of the sister of this boy?
<p/>Which I meantersay, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>Joe now observed in a manner that was at once expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, and great politeness, <div class="bookquote">``as I hup and married your sister, and I were at the time what you might call -LRB-if you was anyways inclined-RRB- a single man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>'' It was very aggravating; but, throughout the interview, Joe persisted in addressing Me instead of Miss Havisham. '' <div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham.
<p/>'' And you have reared the boy, with the intention of taking him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) for your apprentice; is that so, Mr. Gargery?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>replied Joe, <div class="bookquote">``as you and me were ever friends, and it were looked for`ard to betwixt us, as being calc`lated to lead to larks.
<p/>but what, Pip, if you had ever made objections to the business,--such as its being open to black and sut, or
<p/>Not such-like,--not but what they would have been attended to, don't you see?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Has the boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham, <div class="bookquote">``ever made any objection?
<p/>Which it is well beknown to yourself, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>returned Joe, strengthening his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) former mixture of argumentation, confidence, and politeness, <div class="bookquote">``that it were the wish of your own hart.
<p/>-LRB-I saw the idea suddenly break upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) would adapt his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) epitaph to the occasion, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) went on to say-RRB-

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>It was quite in vain for me to endeavor to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) sensible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) ought to speak to Miss Havisham.
<p/>The more I made faces and gestures to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) to do it, the more confidential, argumentative, and polite, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) persisted in being to Me.
<p/>Well, Pip, you know,'' replied Joe, as if that were a little unreasonable, <div class="bookquote">``you yourself see me put 'em in my `at, and therefore you know as they are here.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Have you brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) indentures with you?'' asked Miss Havisham. '' '' With which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) took them out, and gave them, not to Miss Havisham, but to me.
<p/>I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear good fellow,--I know I was ashamed of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>),--when I saw that Estella stood at the back of Miss Havisham's chair, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) eyes laughed mischievously.
<p/>I took the indentures out of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hand and gave them to Miss Havisham. '' You expected,'' said Miss Havisham, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) looked them over, <div class="bookquote">``no premium with the boy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>returned Joe, cutting me short as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were hurt, ``which I meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself and me, and which you know the answer to be full
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Joe!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I remonstrated, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) made no reply at all. '' Why don't you answer--'' well No. You know it to be No, Pip, and wherefore should I say it?
<p/>Miss Havisham glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) understood what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) really was better than I had thought possible, seeing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) was there; and took up a little bag from the table beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>). ''
<p/>'' Pip has earned a premium here,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and here it is. There are five-and-twenty guineas in this bag. Give it to your master, Pip.
<p/>As if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) were absolutely out of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) mind with the wonder awakened in him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) strange figure and the strange room, Joe, even at this pass, persisted in addressing me.
<p/>This is wery liberal on your part, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``and it is as such received and grateful welcome, though never looked for, far nor near, nor nowheres.
<p/>And now, old chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, conveying to me a sensation, first of burning and then of freezing, for I felt as if that familiar expression were applied to Miss
<p/>May you and me do our duty, both on us, by one and another, and by them which your liberal present--have-conweyed--to be--for the satisfaction of mind-of--them as never--'' here Joe showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) had fallen into frightful difficulties, until he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) triumphantly rescued himself with the words, <div class="bookquote">``and from myself far be it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' Havisham,--<div class="bookquote">``and now, old chap, may we do our duty! These words had such a round and convincing sound for him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) said them twice.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Pip/Mr. Pip</b></font>)</div>Good-bye, Pip!'' said Miss Havisham. <div class="bookquote">``Let them out, Estella.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Am I to come again, Miss Havisham? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. ''
<p/>Thus calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) back as I went out of the door, I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) say to Joe in a distinct emphatic voice, <div class="bookquote">``The boy has been a good boy here, and that is his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) reward.
<p/>No. Gargery is your master now. Gargery! One word!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Of course, as an honest man, you will expect no other and no more.
<p/>How Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but I know that when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did get out he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was steadily proceeding upstairs instead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and laid hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' In another minute we were outside the gate, and it was locked, and Estella was gone. When we stood in the daylight alone again, Joe backed up against a wall, and said to me, ``Astonishing!
<p/>And there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remained so long saying, <div class="bookquote">``Astonishing''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>at intervals, so often, that I began to think his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses were never coming back.
<p/>At length he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prolonged his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remark into <div class="bookquote">``Pip, I do assure you this is as-TON-ishing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and so, by degrees, became conversational and able to walk away.
<p/>I have reason to think that Joe's intellects were brightened by the encounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook's he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) invented a subtle and deep design.
<p/>My reason is to be found in what took place in Mr. Pumblechook's parlor: where, on our presenting ourselves, my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman.
<p/>'' '' Well?'' cried my sister, addressing us both at once. '' And what's happened to you? I wonder you condescend to come back to such poor society as this, I am sure I do!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Havisham,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort of remembrance, <div class="bookquote">``made it wery partick`ler that we should give her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)--were it compliments or respects, Pip?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Compliments,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.

<p/>And drew a long breath. '' Well!'' cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr. Pumblechook. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) might have had the politeness to send that message at first, but it's better late than never.
<p/>And what did she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) give young Rantipole here?''

<p/>My sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) wooden arm-chair, and nodded at her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) and at the fire, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had known all about it beforehand.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>'' And how much have you got? '' asked my sister, laughing.

<p/>'' They'd say,'' returned my sister, curtly, <div class="bookquote">``pretty well. Not too much, but pretty well. ''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>'' It's more than that, then,'' said Joe.
<p/>That fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) rubbed the arms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) chair, <div class="bookquote">``It's more than that, Mum.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you don't mean to say--''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>began my sister. '' Yes I do, Mum,'' said Pumblechook; <div class="bookquote">``but wait a bit. Go on, Joseph.

<p/>'' Well, then,'' said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``It's more than twenty pound. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>That abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with a patronizing laugh, <div class="bookquote">``It's more than that, Mum.

(<font color='red'><b>That hypocrite Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then to make an end of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to my sister; <div class="bookquote">``it's five-and-twenty pound.''

<p/>I say we went over, but I was pushed over by Pumblechook, exactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick; indeed, it was the general impression in Court that I had been taken red-handed; for,
<p/>as Pumblechook shoved me before him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) through the crowd, I heard some people say, <div class="bookquote">``What's he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) done?''  (<font color='red'><b>some people</b></font>)</div>and others, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)'s a young `un, too, but looks bad, don't he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div><p/>One person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted up with a perfect sausage-shop of fetters, and entitled TO BE READ IN MY CELL.
<p/>I said I'd see to it--to tell you the truth. '' The Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it than a church,--and
<p/>with people hanging over the pews looking on,--and with mighty Justices -LRB-one with a powdered head-RRB- leaning back in chairs, with folded arms, or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or writing, or reading the newspapers,--and with some shining black portraits on the walls, which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and sticking-plaster.
<p/>Here, in a corner my indentures were duly signed and attested, and I was <div class="bookquote">``bound'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>; Mr. Pumblechook holding me all the while as if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold, to have those little preliminaries disposed of.
<p/>When we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who had been put into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured, and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely rallying round me, we went back to Pumblechook's.
<p/>And there my sister became so excited by the twenty-five guineas, that nothing would serve her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue Boar, and that Pumblechook must go over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) chaise-cart, and bring the Hubbles and Mr. Wopsle.
<p/>For, it inscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the whole company, that I was an excrescence on the entertainment.
<p/>And to make it worse, they all asked me from time to time,--in short, whenever they had nothing else to do,--why
<p/>It was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed. I didn't enjoy myself? And what could I possibly do then, but say I was enjoying myself,--when
<p/>That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficent contriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table; and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and had fiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I played at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company, or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared to contemplate as next to inevitable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) placed me standing on a chair beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) to illustrate his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) remarks.
<p/>My only other remembrances of the great festival are, That they wouldn't let me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off, woke me up and told me to enjoy myself.
<p/>That, rather late in the evening Mr. Wopsle gave us Collins's ode, and threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) bloodstained sword in thunder down, with such effect, that a waiter came in and said, <div class="bookquote">``The Commercials underneath sent up their compliments, and it wasn't the Tumblers' Arms.
<p/>I wasn't! However, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made the most of it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a waiter</b></font>)</div>That, they were all in excellent spirits on the road home, and sang, O Lady Fair!
<p/>Mr. Wopsle taking the bass, and asserting with a tremendously strong voice -LRB-in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner, by wanting to know all about everybody's private affairs-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) was the man with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) white locks flowing, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going.
<p/>Finally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly wretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like Joe's trade.
<p/>I had liked it once, but once was not now. Chapter XIV It is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home.
<p/>There may be black ingratitude in the thing, and the punishment may be retributive and well deserved; but that it is a miserable thing, I can testify.
<p/>Home had never been a very pleasant place to me, because of my sister's temper. But, Joe had sanctified it, and I had believed in it.
<p/>I had believed in the best parlor as a most elegant saloon; I had believed in the front door, as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whose solemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls; I had believed in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment; I had believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and independence.
<p/>Now it was all coarse and common, and I would not have had Miss Havisham and Estella see it on any account.
<p/>How much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault, how much Miss Havisham's, how much my sister's, is now of no moment to me or to any one.
<p/>Within a single year all this was changed. The change was made in me; the thing was done. Well or ill done, excusably or inexcusably, it was done.
<p/>Once, it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up my shirt-sleeves and go into the forge, Joe's `prentice, I should be distinguished and happy.
<p/>Now the reality was in my hold, I only felt that I was dusty with the dust of small-coal, and that I had a weight upon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather.
<p/>There have been occasions in my later life -LRB-I suppose as in most lives-RRB- when I have felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest and romance, to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any more.
<p/>Never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank, as when my way in life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly entered road of apprenticeship to Joe.
<p/>I remember that at a later period of my <div class="bookquote">``time,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I used to stand about the churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling, comparing my own perspective with the windy marsh view, and making out some likeness between them by thinking how flat and low both were, and how on both there came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea.
<p/>I was quite as dejected on the first working-day of my apprenticeship as in that after-time; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joe while my indentures lasted.
<p/>It is about the only thing I am glad to know of myself in that connection. For, though it includes what I proceed to add, all the merit of what I proceed to add was Joe's.
<p/>It was not because I was faithful, but because Joe was faithful, that I never ran away and went for a soldier or a sailor.
<p/>It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of industry, but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry, that I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain.
<p/>It is not possible to know how far the influence of any amiable honest-hearted duty-doing man flies out into the world; but it is very possible to know how it has touched one's self in going by, and I know right well that any good that intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented Joe, and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me.
<p/>What I dreaded was, that in some unlucky hour I, being at my grimiest and commonest, should lift up my eyes and see Estella looking in at one of the wooden windows of the forge.
<p/>I was haunted by the fear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would, sooner or later, find me out, with a black face and hands, doing the coarsest part of my work, and would exult over me and despise me.
<p/>Often after dark, when I was pulling the bellows for Joe, and we were singing Old Clem, and when the thought how we used to sing it at Miss Havisham's would seem to show me Estella's face in the fire, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) pretty hair fluttering in the wind and her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) eyes scorning me,--often at such a time I would look towards those panels of black night in the wall which the wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) just drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) face away, and would believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had come at last.
<p/>After that, when we went into supper, the place and the meal would have a more homely look than ever, and I would feel more ashamed of home than ever, in my own ungracious breast.
<p/>What I wanted, who can say? How can I say, when I never knew? Chapter XV As I was getting too big for Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's room, my education under that preposterous female terminated.
<p/>Not, however, until Biddy had imparted to me everything she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) knew, from the little catalogue of prices, to a comic song she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) had once bought for a half-penny.
<p/>Although the only coherent part of the latter piece of literature were the opening lines. When I went to Lunnon town sirs, Too rul loo rul
<p/>, in my desire to be wiser, I got this composition by heart with the utmost gravity; nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit, except that I thought -LRB-as I still do-RRB- the amount of Too rul somewhat in excess of the poetry.
<p/>In my hunger for information, I made proposals to Mr. Wopsle to bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) kindly complied.
<p/>As it turned out, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) only wanted me for a dramatic lay-figure, to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways, I soon declined that course of instruction; though not until Mr. Wopsle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) poetic fury had severely mauled me.
<p/>Too rul loo rul Wasn't I done very brown sirs? Too rul loo rul Too rul loo rul --still Whatever I acquired, I tried to impart to Joe.
<p/>I wanted to make Joe less ignorant and common, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) might be worthier of my society and less open to Estella's reproach.
<p/>The old Battery out on the marshes was our place of study, and a broken slate and a short piece of slate-pencil were our educational implements: to which Joe always added a pipe of tobacco.
<p/>I never knew Joe to remember anything from one Sunday to another, or to acquire, under my tuition, any piece of information whatever.
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) would smoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) pipe at the Battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere else,--even with a learned air,--as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) considered himself to be advancing immensely.
<p/>This statement sounds so well, that I cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained. Dear fellow, I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did.
<p/>It was pleasant and quiet, out there with the sails on the river passing beyond the earthwork, and sometimes, when the tide was low, looking as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the bottom of the water.
<p/>Whenever I watched the vessels standing out to sea with their white sails spread, I somehow thought of Miss Havisham and Estella; and whenever the light struck aslant, afar off, upon a cloud or sail or green hillside or water-line, it was just the same.--Miss Havisham and Estella and the strange house and the strange life appeared to have something to do with everything that was picturesque.
<p/>One Sunday when Joe, greatly enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) pipe, had so plumed himself on being <div class="bookquote">``most awful dull,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>that I had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) up for the day, I lay on the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand, descrying traces of Miss Havisham and Estella all over the prospect, in the sky and in the water, until at last I resolved to mention a thought concerning them that had been much in my head.
<p/>'' Joe,'' said I; <div class="bookquote">``don't you think I ought to make Miss Havisham a visit?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Well, Pip,'' returned Joe, slowly considering.
<p/>'' What for?'' <div class="bookquote">``What for, Joe? What is any visit made for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>'' There is some wisits p`r`aps,'' said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``as for ever remains open to the question, Pip.
<p/>But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham. She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) might think you wanted something,--expected something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't you think I might say that I did not, Joe?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Joe felt, as I did, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) had made a point there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) pulled hard at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition.
<p/>You see, Pip,'' Joe pursued, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) was past that danger, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Havisham done the handsome thing by you.
<p/>When Miss Havisham done the handsome thing by you, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) called me back to say to me as that were all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You might, old chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. '' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) might credit it. Similarly she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) mightn't. '' '' '' Yes, Joe. I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>).''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``ALL,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe repeated, very emphatically. '' Yes, Joe. I tell you, I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>).'' '' Which I meantersay, Pip, it might be that her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) meaning were,--Make
<p/>I had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me to find that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) had thought of it; for it seemed to render it more probable.
<p/>a end on it!--As you was!--Me to the North, and you to the South!--Keep in sunders! '' '' But, Joe. ''
<p/>Here am I, getting on in the first year of my time, and, since the day of my being bound, I have never thanked Miss Havisham, or asked after her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), or shown that I remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>).''
<p/>That's true, Pip; and unless you was to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) out a set of shoes all four round,--and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all four round might not be acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy of hoofs--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, old chap. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't mean that sort of remembrance, Joe; I don't mean a present. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>But Joe had got the idea of a present in his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) head and must harp upon it. '' Or even,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>),
<p/><div class="bookquote">``if you was helped to knocking her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) up a new chain for the front door,--or say a gross or two of shark-headed screws for general use,--or some light fancy article, such as a toasting-fork when she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) muffins,--or a gridiron when she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) took a sprat or such like--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean any present at all, Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I interposed.
<p/>'' Well,'' said Joe, still harping on it as though I had particularly pressed it, <div class="bookquote">``if I was yourself, Pip, I wouldn't.
<p/>No, I would not. For what's a door-chain when she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'s got one always up? And shark-headers is open to misrepresentations. And if it was a toasting-fork, you'd go into brass and do yourself no credit.
<p/>a gridiron IS a gridiron,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Joe, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) were endeavouring to rouse me from a fixed delusion, <div class="bookquote">``and you may haim at what you like, but a gridiron it will come out, either by your leave or again your leave, and you can't help yourself--
<p/>And the oncommonest workman can't show himself oncommon in a gridiron,--for ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' My dear Joe,'' I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) coat, <div class="bookquote">``don't go on in that way.
<p/>I never thought of making Miss Havisham any present.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe assented, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) had been contending for that, all along; <div class="bookquote">``and
<p/>Yes, Joe; but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slack just now, if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow, I think I would go uptown and make a call on Miss Est--Havisham.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>what I say to you is, you are right, Pip.'' '' '' Which her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) name,'' said Joe, gravely, <div class="bookquote">``ain't Estavisham, Pip, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) have been rechris`ened.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know, Joe, I know. It was a slip of mine. What do you think of it, Joe? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>In brief, Joe thought that if I thought well of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) thought well of it.
<p/>But, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) was particular in stipulating that if I were not received with cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a visit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a favor received, then this experimental trip should have no successor.
<p/>By these conditions I promised to abide. Now, Joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) pretended that his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) Christian name was Dolge,--a clear Impossibility,--but
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) to have been the prey of no delusion in this particular, but wilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its understanding.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) never even seemed to come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by mere accident; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) dinner, or went away at night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) would slouch out, like Cain or the Wandering Jew, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) had no idea where he (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) was going and no intention of ever coming back.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) lodged at a sluice-keeper's out on the marshes, and on working-days would come slouching from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) hermitage, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) pockets and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) neck and dangling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) back.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) was a broadshouldered loose-limbed swarthy fellow of great strength, never in a hurry, and always slouching. On Sundays he (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) mostly lay all day on the sluice-gates, or stood against ricks and barns.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) always slouched, locomotively, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) eyes on the ground; and, when accosted or otherwise required to raise them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) looked up in a half-resentful, half-puzzled way, as though the only thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) ever had was, that it was rather an odd and injurious fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) should never be thinking.
<p/>When I was very small and timid, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>) gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black corner of the forge, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) knew the fiend very well: also that it was necessary to make up the fire, once in seven years, with a live boy, and that I might consider myself fuel.
<p/>When I became Joe's `prentice, Orlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displace him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>); howbeit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) liked me still less.
<p/>Not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) ever said anything, or did anything, openly importing hostility; I only noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) always beat his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) sparks in my direction, and that whenever I sang Old Clem, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) came in out of time.
<p/>This morose journeyman had no liking for me. Dolge Orlick was at work and present, next day, when I reminded Joe of my half-holiday.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>) said nothing at the moment, for he (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>) and Joe had just got a piece of hot iron between them, and I was at the bellows; but by and by he (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>) said, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>) hammer,--
<p/>'' Now, master! Sure you're not a going to favor only one of us. If Young Pip has a half-holiday, do as much for Old Orlick.
<p/>'' I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) was about five-and-twenty, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) usually spoke of himself as an ancient person. '' Why, what'll you do with a half-holiday, if you get it?'' said Joe.
<p/>'' What'll I do with it! What'll he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) do with it? I'll do as much with it as him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>),'' said Orlick.
<p/>'' As to Pip, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>)'s going up town,'' said Joe. '' Well then, as to Old Orlick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>)'s a going up town,'' retorted that worthy.
<p/>'' Two can go up town. Tain't only one wot can go up town. '' Don't lose your temper,'' said Joe.
<p/>'' Shall if I like,'' growled Orlick. '' Some and their uptowning! Now, master! Come. No favoring in this shop. Be a man!''
<p/>The master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in a better temper, Orlick plunged at the furnace, drew out a red-hot bar, made at me with it as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) were going to run it through my body, whisked it round my head, laid it on the anvil, hammered it out,--as if it were I,
<p/>I thought, and the sparks were my spirting blood,--and finally said, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had hammered himself hot and the iron cold, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) again leaned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) hammer,--
<p/>'' Now, master!'' <div class="bookquote">``Are you all right now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>demanded Joe. '' Ah! I am all right,'' said gruff Old Orlick. ''
<p/>Then, as in general you stick to your work as well as most men,'' said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``let it be a half-holiday for all.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>My sister had been standing silent in the yard, within hearing,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was a most unscrupulous spy and listener,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) instantly looked in at one of the windows.
<p/>'' Like you, you fool!'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) to Joe, <div class="bookquote">``giving holidays to great idle hulkers like that. You are a rich man, upon my life, to waste wages in that way.
<p/>I wish I was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>'' You'd be everybody's master, if you durst,'' retorted Orlick, with an ill-favored grin. -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.-RRB-
<p/>I'd be a match for all noodles and all rogues,'' returned my sister, beginning to work herself into a mighty rage.
<p/>And I couldn't be a match for the noodles, without being a match for your master, who's the dunder-headed king of the noodles.
<p/>And I couldn't be a match for the rogues, without being a match for you, who are the blackest-looking and the worst rogue between this and France.
<p/>'' '' Now!'' '' You're a foul shrew, Mother Gargery,'' growled the journeyman. '' If that makes a judge of rogues, you ought to be a good`un.
<p/>'' -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) alone, will you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe.-RRB- '' What did you say?'' cried my sister, beginning to scream. '' What did you say?
<p/>What did that fellow Orlick say to me, Pip? What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) call me, with my husband standing by? Oh! oh!
<p/>what is equally true of all the violent women I have ever seen, that passion was no excuse for her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) consciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself into it, and became blindly furious by regular stages; <div class="bookquote">``what was the name he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) gave me before the base man who swore to defend me?
<p/>oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Each of these exclamations was a shriek; and I must remark of my sister, Oh! Hold me! Oh!'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah-h-h! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the journeyman</b></font>)</div>growled the journeyman, between his (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>) teeth,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd hold you, if you was my wife. I'd hold you under the pump, and choke it out of you. ''

To hear him (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>)!'' cried my sister, with a clap of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) hands and a scream
<p/>together,--which was her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) next stage. '' To hear the names he (<font color='blue'><b>journeyman</b></font>)'s giving me! That Orlick! In my own house! Me, a married woman!
<p/>Here my sister, after a fit of clappings and screamings, beat her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) bosom and upon her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) knees, and threw her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cap off, and pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hair down,--which were the last stages on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) road to frenzy.
<p/>Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete success, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked.
<p/>What could the wretched Joe do now, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) disregarded parenthetical interruptions, but stand up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) journeyman, and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) meant by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe; and further whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) was man enough to come on?
<p/>Old Orlick felt that the situation admitted of nothing less than coming on, and was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) defence straightway; so, without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons, they went at one another, like two giants.
<p/>With my husband standing by! Oh! Oh!'' But, if any man in that neighborhood could stand uplong against Joe, I never saw the man.
<p/>Orlick, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had been of no more account than the pale young gentleman, was very soon among the coal-dust, and in no hurry to come out of it.
<p/>Then Joe unlocked the door and picked up my sister, who had dropped insensible at the window -LRB-but who had seen the fight first, I think-RRB-, and who was carried into the house and laid down, and who was recommended to revive, and would do nothing but struggle and clench her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) hands in Joe's hair.
<p/>Then, came that singular calm and silence which succeed all uproars; and then, with the vague sensation which I have always connected with such a lull,--namely, that it was Sunday, and somebody was dead,--I went upstairs to dress myself.
<p/>When I came down again, I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up, without any other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlick's nostrils, which was neither expressive nor ornamental.
<p/>A pot of beer had appeared from the Jolly Bargemen, and they were sharing it by turns in a peaceable manner.
<p/>The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on Joe, who followed me out into the road to say, as a parting observation that might do me good, <div class="bookquote">``On the Rampage, Pip, and off the Rampage, Pip:--such is Life!''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>With what absurd emotions -LRB-for we think the feelings that are very serious in a man quite comical in a boy-RRB-
<p/>I found myself again going to Miss Havisham's, matters little here. Nor, how I passed and repassed the gate many times before I could make up my mind to ring.
<p/>Nor, how I debated whether I should go away without ringing; nor, how I should undoubtedly have gone, if my time had been my own, to come back.
<p/>Miss Sarah Pocket came to the gate. No Estella. '' How, then? You here again?'' said Miss Pocket. '' What do you want?
<p/>When I said that I only came to see how Miss Havisham was, Sarah evidently deliberated whether or no she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) should send me about my business.
<p/>But unwilling to hazard the responsibility, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) let me in, and presently brought the sharp message that I was to <div class="bookquote">``come up.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Everything was unchanged, and Miss Havisham was alone. '' Well?'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) eyes upon me. '' I hope you want nothing?
<p/>I only wanted you to know that I am doing very well in my apprenticeship, and am always much obliged to you.''
<p/>You'll get nothing.'' '' No indeed, Miss Havisham. '' There, there!'' with the old restless fingers. <div class="bookquote">``Come now and then; come on your birthday.--Ay!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) cried suddenly, turning herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) chair towards me, <div class="bookquote">``You are looking round for Estella? Hey? ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I had been looking round,--in fact, for Estella,--and I stammered that I hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was well.
<p/>Abroad,'' said Miss Havisham; <div class="bookquote">``educating for a lady; far out of reach; prettier than ever; admired by all who see her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>).
<p/>There was such a malignant enjoyment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) utterance of the last words, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) broke into such a disagreeable laugh, that I was at a loss what to say.
<p/>When the gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the walnut-shell countenance, I felt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with everything; and that was all I took by that motion.
<p/>As I was loitering along the High Street, looking in disconsolately at the shop windows, and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman, who should come out of the bookshop but Mr. Wopsle.
<p/>Mr. Wopsle had in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) had that moment invested sixpence, with the view of heaping every word of it on the head of Pumblechook, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) was going to drink tea.
<p/>No sooner did he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) see me, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) appeared to consider that a special Providence had put a `prentice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) way to be read at; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) laid hold of me, and insisted on my accompanying him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) to the Pumblechookian parlor.
<p/>As I knew it would be miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and the way was dreary, and almost any companionship on the road was better than none, I made no great resistance; consequently, we turned into Pumblechook's just as the street and the shops were lighting up.
<p/>As I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell, I don't know how long it may usually take; but I know very well that it took until half-past nine o' clock that night, and that when Mr. Wopsle got into Newgate, I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) never would go to the scaffold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) became so much slower than at any former period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) disgraceful career.
<p/>I thought it a little too much that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) should complain of being cut short in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) flower after all, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) had not been running to seed, leaf after leaf, ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) course began.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>Do you feel that you have lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>)? '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) spared me the trouble of considering, by dismissing me. This, however, was a mere question of length and wearisomeness.
<p/>When Barnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I felt positively apologetic, Pumblechook's indignant stare so taxed me with it.
<p/>What stung me, was the identification of the whole affair with my unoffending self. Wopsle, too, took pains to present me in the worst light.
<p/>At once ferocious and maudlin, I was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating circumstances whatever; Millwood put me down in argument, on every occasion; it became sheer monomania in my master's daughter to care a button for me; and all I can say for my gasping and procrastinating conduct on the fatal morning, is, that it was worthy of the general feebleness of my character.
<p/>, Pumblechook sat staring at me, and shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) head, and saying, <div class="bookquote">``Take warning, boy, take warning!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>as if it were a well-known fact that I contemplated murdering a near relation, provided I could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor.
<p/>It was a very dark night when it was all over, and when I set out with Mr. Wopsle on the walk home.
<p/>Even after I was happily hanged and Wopsle had closed the book Beyond town, we found a heavy mist out, and it fell wet and thick.
<p/>The turnpike lamp was a blur, quite out of the lamp's usual place apparently, and its rays looked solid substance on the fog.
<p/>We were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rose with a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes, when we came upon a man, slouching under the lee of the turnpike house.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Orlick/Old Orlick</b></font>)</div>we said, stopping. '' Orlick there?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) answered, slouching out. '' I was standing by a minute, on the chance of company.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You are late,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked. Orlick not unnaturally answered, <div class="bookquote">``Well? And you're late.''  (<font color='red'><b>Orlick/Old Orlick</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We have been,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wopsle, exalted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) late performance,--<div class="bookquote">``we have been indulging, Mr. Orlick, in an intellectual evening.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>Old Orlick growled, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had nothing to say about that, and we all went on together. I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) presently whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had been spending his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) half-holiday up and down town?
<p/>'' Yes,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``all of it. I come in behind yourself. I didn't see you, but I must have been pretty close behind you.
<p/>By the by, the guns is going again.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``At the Hulks?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Ay! There's some of the birds flown from the cages.
<p/>In effect, we had not walked many yards further, when the well-remembered boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavily rolled away along the low grounds by the river, as if it were pursuing and threatening the fugitives.
<p/>The guns have been going since dark, about. You'll hear one presently. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>'' A good night for cutting off in,'' said Orlick.
<p/>'' We'd be puzzled how to bring down a jail-bird on the wing, to-night. '' The subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it in silence.
<p/>Mr. Wopsle, as the ill-requited uncle of the evening's tragedy, fell to meditating aloud in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) garden at Camberwell. Orlick, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) pockets, slouched heavily at my side.
<p/>Now and then, the sound of the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again rolled sulkily along the course of the river.
<p/>It was very dark, very wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along. I kept myself to myself and my thoughts.
<p/>Mr. Wopsle died amiably at Camberwell, and exceedingly game on Bosworth Field, and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury. Orlick sometimes growled, <div class="bookquote">``Beat it out, beat it out,--Old Clem!
<p/>With a clink for the stout,--Old Clem! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Orlick/Old Orlick</b></font>)</div>I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Clem</b></font>) had been drinking, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Clem</b></font>) was not drunk. Thus, we came to the village.
<p/>The way by which we approached it took us past the Three Jolly Bargemen, which we were surprised to find--it being eleven o'clock--in a state of commotion, with the door wide open, and unwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered about.
<p/>Mr. Wopsle dropped into ask what was the matter -LRB-surmising that a convict had been taken-RRB-, but came running out in a great hurry.
<p/>'' There's something wrong,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>), without stopping, <div class="bookquote">``up at your place, Pip. Run all!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' What is it? '' I asked, keeping up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>).
<p/>So did Orlick, at my side. '' I can't quite understand. The house seems to have been violently entered when Joe Gargery was out.
<p/>We were running too fast to admit of more being said, and we made no stop until we got into our kitchen.
<p/>It was full of people; the whole village was there, or in the yard; and there was a surgeon, and there was Joe, and there were a group of women, all on the floor in the midst of the kitchen.
<p/>The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me, and so I became aware of my sister,--lying without sense or movement on the bare boards where she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had been knocked down by a tremendous blow on the back of the head, dealt by some unknown hand when her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) face was turned towards the fire,--destined never to be on the Rampage again, while she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was the wife of Joe.
<p/>With my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to believe that I must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister, or at all events that as her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) near relation, popularly known to be under obligations to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than any one else.
<p/>But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I began to reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all sides, I took another view of the case, which was more reasonable.
<p/>Joe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) pipe, from a quarter after eight o'clock to a quarter before ten.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) was there, my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had exchanged Good Night with a farm-laborer going home.
<p/>The man could not be more particular as to the time at which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got into dense confusion when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried to be-RRB-, than that it must have been before nine.
<p/>When Joe went home at five minutes before ten, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) struck down on the floor, and promptly called in assistance.
<p/>The fire had not then burnt unusually low, nor was the snuff of the candle very long; the candle, however, had been blown out.
<p/>Supposed by convicts. Somebody has been attacked and hurt. '' Chapter XVI Nothing had been taken away from any part of the house.
<p/>Neither, beyond the blowing out of the candle,--which stood on a table between the door and my sister, and was behind her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) stood facing the fire and was struck,--was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting such as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) herself had made, in falling and bleeding.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had been struck with something blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows were dealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) with considerable violence, as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) face.
<p/>But, there was one remarkable piece of evidence on the spot. And on the ground beside her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), when Joe picked her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) up, was a convict's leg-iron which had been filed asunder.
<p/>The hue and cry going off to the Hulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Joe's opinion was corroborated.
<p/>They did not undertake to say when it had left the prison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged; but they claimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been worn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night.
<p/>Now, Joe, examining this iron with a smith's eye, declared it to have been filed asunder some time ago. Further, one of those two was already retaken, and had not freed himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>) iron.
<p/>I believed the iron to be my convict's iron,--the iron I had seen and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>) filing at, on the marshes,--but
<p/>Knowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here. my mind did not accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>) of having put it to its latest use.
<p/>For I believed one of two other persons to have become possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account.
<p/>Now, as to Orlick; he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had gone to town exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) told us when we picked him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) up at the turnpike, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had been seen about town all the evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had been in divers companies in several public-houses, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle.
<p/>There was nothing against him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>), save the quarrel; and my sister had quarrelled with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>), and with everybody else about her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), ten thousand times.
<p/>As to the strange man; if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come back for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two bank-notes there could have been no dispute about them, because my sister was fully prepared to restore them.
<p/>Besides, there had been no altercation; the assailant had come in so silently and suddenly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had been felled before she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could look round.
<p/>Either Orlick, or the strange man who had shown me the file. It was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however undesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise.
<p/>I suffered unspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I should at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the story.
<p/>The contention came, after all, to this;--the secret was such an old one now, had so grown into me and become a part of myself, that I could not tear it away.
<p/>In addition to the dread that, having led up to so much mischief, it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) believed it, I had a further restraining dread that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would not believe it, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets as a monstrous invention.
<p/>However, I temporized with myself, of course--for, was I not wavering between right and wrong, when the thing is always done?--and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see any such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of the assailant.
<p/>The Constables and the Bow Street men from London--for, this happened in the days of the extinct red-waistcoated police--were about the house for a week or two, and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like authorities doing in other such cases.
<p/>They took up several obviously wrong people, and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas, and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas, instead of trying to extract ideas from the circumstances.
<p/>Also, they stood about the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looks that filled the whole neighborhood with admiration; and they had a mysterious manner of taking their drink, that was almost as good as taking the culprit.
<p/>For months afterwards, I every day settled the question finally in the negative, and reopened and reargued it next morning. But not quite, for they never did it.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sight was disturbed, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) saw objects multiplied, and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the realities; her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hearing was greatly impaired; her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) memory also; and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) speech was unintelligible.
<p/>When, at last, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) came round so far as to be helped downstairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate always by her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) might indicate in writing what she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could not indicate in speech.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was -LRB-very bad handwriting apart-RRB- a more than indifferent speller, and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader, extraordinary complications arose between them which I was always called in to solve.
<p/>The administration of mutton instead of medicine, the substitution of Tea for Joe, and the baker for bacon, were among the mildest of my own mistakes.
<p/>Long after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister lay very ill in bed. However, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) temper was greatly improved, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was patient.
<p/>A tremulous uncertainty of the action of all her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) limbs soon became a part of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) regular state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or three months, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would often put her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) head, and would then remain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind.
<p/>Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she (<font color='blue'><b>great-aunt</b></font>) had fallen, and Biddy became a part of our establishment.
<p/>It may have been about a month after my sister's reappearance in the kitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.
<p/>Above all, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wife, and had been accustomed, while attending on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) of an evening, to turn to me every now and then and say, with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) blue eyes moistened, <div class="bookquote">``Such a fine figure of a woman as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) once were, Pip!''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Biddy instantly taking the cleverest charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had studied her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from infancy; Joe became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) life, and to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that did him (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) good.
<p/>It was characteristic of the police people that they had all more or less suspected poor Joe -LRB-though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) never knew it-RRB-, and that they had to a man concurred in regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) as one of the deepest spirits they had ever encountered.
<p/>We were at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), until a circumstance happened conveniently to relieve us. Biddy's first triumph in her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) new office, was to solve a difficulty that had completely vanquished me.
<p/>Again and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a character that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) particularly wanted.
<p/>I had tried hard at it, but had made nothing of it. Thus it was:-- I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T, from tar to toast and tub.
<p/>At length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my sister's ear, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent.
<p/>Then I bethought me of a crutch, the shape being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) head to that extent when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was shown it, that we were terrified lest in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) weak and shattered state she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) should dislocate her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) neck.
<p/>Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one after another, but without avail. When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate.
<p/>Biddy looked thoughtfully at it, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked thoughtfully at Joe -LRB-who was always represented on the slate by his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) initial letter-RRB-, and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me.
<p/>'' Why, of course!'' cried Biddy, with an exultant face. '' Don't you see? It's him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)!'' Orlick, without a doubt! She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) name, and could only signify him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) hammer.
<p/>We told him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) why we wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) to come into the kitchen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) slowly laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) hammer, wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) brow with his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) arm, took another wipe at it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) apron, and came slouching out, with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), was evidently much pleased by his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) being at length produced, and motioned that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) would have him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) given something to drink.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) countenance as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) were particularly wishful to be assured that he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) took kindly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) reception, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) showed every possible desire to conciliate him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), and there was an air of humble propitiation in all she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) did, such as I have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master.
<p/>After that day, a day rarely passed without her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) drawing the hammer on her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) slate, and without Orlick's slouching in and standing doggedly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) knew no more than I did what to make of it.
<p/>I confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), and that I was disappointed by the different result. Chapter XVII
<p/>I now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life, which was varied beyond the limits of the village and the marshes, by no more remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying another visit to Miss Havisham.
<p/>I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on duty at the gate; I found Miss Havisham just as I had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) spoke of Estella in the very same way, if not in the very same words.
<p/>The interview lasted but a few minutes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) gave me a guinea when I was going, and told me to come again on my next birthday.
<p/>I tried to decline taking the guinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect than causing her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) to ask me very angrily, if I expected more?
<p/>So unchanging was the dull old house, the yellow light in the darkened room, the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing-table glass, that I felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that mysterious place, and, while I and everything else outside it grew older, it stood still.
<p/>Daylight never entered the house as to my thoughts and remembrances of it, any more than as to the actual fact.
<p/>It bewildered me, and under its influence I continued at heart to hate my trade and to be ashamed of home.
<p/>I may mention at once that this became an annual custom. Then, and after that, I took it. Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) shoes came up at the heel, her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) hair grew bright and neat, her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) hands were always clean. She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was not beautiful,--she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was common, and could not be like
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had not been with us more than a year -LRB-I remember her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) being newly out of mourning at the time it struck me-RRB-, when I observed to myself one evening that she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes; eyes that were very pretty and very good.
<p/>It came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring at--writing some passages from a book, to improve myself in two ways at once by a sort of stratagem--and seeing Biddy observant of what I was about.
<p/>Estella,--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered. I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) needlework without laying it down.
<p/>'' Biddy,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``how do you manage it? Either I am very stupid, or you are very clever. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did not mean that, though that made what I did mean more surprising.
<p/>What is it that I manage? I don't know,'' returned Biddy, smiling. '' How do you manage, Biddy,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``to learn everything that I learn, and always to keep up with me?
<p/>I was beginning to be rather vain of my knowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the greater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I have no doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.
<p/>No; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see me turning to at it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I might as well ask you,'' said Biddy, <div class="bookquote">``how you manage?''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>'' But you never turn to at it, Biddy.''
<p/>Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked at Biddy sewing away with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head on one side, I began to think her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) rather an extraordinary girl.
<p/>For I called to mind now, that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our different sorts of work, and our various tools.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose I must catch it like a cough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy, quietly; and went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sewing. In short, whatever I knew, Biddy knew.
<p/>Theoretically, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was already as good a blacksmith as I, or better. '' You are one of those, Biddy,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``who make the most of every chance.
<p/>You never had a chance before you came here, and see how improved you are!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Biddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sewing.
<p/>'' I was your first teacher though; wasn't I? '' said she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sewed. '' Biddy! '' I exclaimed, in amazement.
<p/>'' Why, you are crying!'' '' No I am not,'' said Biddy, looking up and laughing. '' What put that in your head?
<p/>'' What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) work?
<p/>I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had been until Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people.
<p/>I recalled the hopeless circumstances by which she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school, with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered.
<p/>I reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first uneasiness and discontent I had turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) for help, as a matter of course.
<p/>Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps I had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy.
<p/>I might have been too reserved, and should have patronized her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) more -LRB-though I did not use that precise word in my meditations-RRB- with my confidence.
<p/>,'' I observed, when I had done turning it over, <div class="bookquote">``you were my first teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like this, in this kitchen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>It was like her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) self-forgetfulness to transfer the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), making her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) more comfortable; <div class="bookquote">``that's sadly true!''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes, Biddy <div class="bookquote">``Ah, poor thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>replied Biddy. <div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``we must talk together a little more, as we used to do.
<p/>And I must consult you a little more, as I used to do. Let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat.
<p/>My sister was never left alone now; but Joe more than readily undertook the care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) on that Sunday afternoon, and Biddy and I went out together.
<p/>When we had passed the village and the church and the churchyard, and were out on the marshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on, I began to combine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect, in my usual way.
<p/>When we came to the river-side and sat down on the bank, with the water rippling at our feet, making it all more quiet than it would have been without that sound, I resolved that it was a good time and place for the admission of Biddy into my inner confidence.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It was summer-time, and lovely weather. '' Biddy,'' said I, after binding her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) to secrecy, <div class="bookquote">``I want to be a gentleman.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O, I wouldn't, if I was you!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) returned. '' I don't think it would answer.'' '' Biddy,'' said I, with some severity, <div class="bookquote">``I have particular reasons for wanting to be a gentleman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You know best, Pip; but don't you think you are happier as you are?''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>'' Biddy,'' I exclaimed, impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``I am not at all happy as I am.
<p/>I am disgusted with my calling and with my life. I have never taken to either, since I was bound. Don't be absurd.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was I absurd?''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy, quietly raising her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyebrows; <div class="bookquote">``I am sorry for that; I didn't mean to be. I only want you to do well, and to be comfortable.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>'' Well, then, understand once for all that I never shall or can be comfortable--or anything but miserable--there, Biddy!--unless I can lead a very different sort of life from the life I lead now.
<p/>Now, I too had so often thought it a pity, that, in the singular kind of quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was half inclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave utterance to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sentiment and my own.
<p/>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was right, and I knew it was much to be regretted, but still it was not to be helped.
<p/>If I could have settled down,'' I said to Biddy, plucking up the short grass within reach, much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall,--<div class="bookquote">``if I could have settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I was little, I know it would have been much better for me.
<p/>You and I and Joe would have wanted nothing then, and Joe and I would perhaps have gone partners when I was out of my time, and I might even have grown up to keep company with you, and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine Sunday, quite different people.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' That's a pity!'' said Biddy, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head with a sorrowful air. '' I should have been good enough for you; shouldn't I, Biddy?''
<p/>Biddy sighed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) looked at the ships sailing on, and returned for answer, <div class="bookquote">``Yes; I am not over-particular. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It scarcely sounded flattering, but I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) meant well.
<p/>'' Instead of that ,'' said I, plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or two, <div class="bookquote">``see how I am going on.
<p/>Biddy turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) face suddenly towards mine, and looked far more attentively at me than she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had looked at the sailing ships.
<p/>It was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) remarked, directing her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) eyes to the ships again.
<p/>Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable, and--what would it signify to me, being coarse and common, if nobody had told me so!'' '' ''
<p/>It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and I answered, <div class="bookquote">``The beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham's, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s more beautiful than anybody ever was, and I admire her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dreadfully, and I want to be a gentleman on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) account.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Having made this lunatic confession, I began to throw my torn-up grass into the river, as if I had some thoughts of following it.
<p/>Who said it? '' I was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where I was going to. ''
<p/>Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) or to gain her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) over?'' Biddy quietly asked me, after a pause.
<p/>Because, if it is to spite her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),'' Biddy pursued, <div class="bookquote">``I should think--but you know best--that might be better and more independently done by caring nothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) words.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>I don't know,'' I moodily answered. '' And if it is to gain her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) over, I should think--but you know best--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not worth gaining over.
<p/>But how could I, a poor dazed village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day?
<p/>'' Exactly what I myself had thought, many times. Exactly what was perfectly manifest to me at the moment. '' It may be all quite true,'' said I to Biddy, <div class="bookquote">``but I admire her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dreadfully.
<p/>In short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a good grasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it well.
<p/>All the while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced, that I was quite conscious it would have served my face
<p/>right, if I had lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against the pebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work, upon my hands, one after another, and gently took them out of my hair.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>Biddy was the wisest of girls, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tried to reason no more with me. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way, while with my face upon my sleeve
<p/>I cried a little,--exactly as I had done in the brewery yard,--and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much ill-used by somebody, or by everybody
<p/>I am glad of one thing,'' said Biddy, <div class="bookquote">``and that is, that you have felt you could give me your confidence, Pip.
<p/>And I am glad of another thing, and that is, that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it and always so far deserving it.
<p/>If your first teacher -LRB-dear! such a poor one, and so much in need of being taught herself!-RRB- had been your teacher at the present time, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knows what lesson she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would set.
<p/>; I can't say which. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>But it would be a hard one to learn, and you have got beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and
<p/>So, with a quiet sigh for me, Biddy rose from the bank, and said, with a fresh and pleasant change of voice, <div class="bookquote">``Shall we walk a little farther, or go home?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div><p/>Biddy,'' I cried, getting up, putting my arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) neck, and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) a kiss, <div class="bookquote">``I shall always tell you everything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>it's of no use now. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Till you're a gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy. '' You know I never shall be, so that's always.
<p/>Not that I have any occasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know,--as I told you at home the other night.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) looked away at the ships. And then repeated, with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) former pleasant change, ``shall we walk a little farther, or go home?
<p/>I said to Biddy we would walk a little farther, and we did so, and the summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it was very beautiful.
<p/>I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and wholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances, than playing beggar my neighbor by candle-light in the room with the stopped clocks, and being despised by Estella.
<p/>I thought it would be very good for me if I could get her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) out of my head, with all the rest of those remembrances and fancies, and could go to work determined to relish what I had to do, and stick to it, and make the best of it.
<p/>I asked myself the question whether I did not surely know that if Estella were beside me at that moment instead of Biddy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would make me miserable?
<p/>I was obliged to admit that I did know it for a certainty, and I said to myself, <div class="bookquote">``Pip, what a fool you are!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day and somebody else to-morrow; she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would have derived only pain, and no pleasure, from giving me pain; she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would far rather have wounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) own breast than mine.
<p/>'' We talked a good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemed right. How could it be, then, that I did not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) much the better of the two? ''
<p/>Biddy,'' said I, when we were walking homeward, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you could put me right. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wish I could!''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy.
<p/>'' If I could only get myself to fall in love with you,--you don't mind my speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?''
<p/>'' Oh dear, not at all!'' said Biddy. '' Don't mind me.'' '' If I could only get myself to do it, that would be the thing for me.''
<p/>It did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening, as it would have done if we had discussed it a few hours before.
<p/>'' But you never will, you see,'' said Biddy. I therefore observed I was not quite sure of that. But Biddy said she (<font color='blue'><b>Biddy</b></font>) was, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Biddy</b></font>) said it decisively.
<p/>In my heart I believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Biddy</b></font>) to be right; and yet I took it rather ill, too, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Biddy</b></font>) should be so positive on the point.
<p/>There started up, from the gate, or from the rushes, or from the ooze -LRB-which was quite in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stagnant way-RRB-, Old Orlick.
<p/>When we came near the churchyard, we had to cross an embankment, and get over a stile near a sluice-gate. <div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) growled, <div class="bookquote">``where are you two going?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where should we be going, but home?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Well, then,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I'm jiggered if I don't see you home!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of, but used it, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind, and convey an idea of something savagely damaging.
<p/>When I was younger, I had had a general belief that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had jiggered me personally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) would have done it with a sharp and twisted hook.
<p/>Biddy was much against his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) going with us, and said to me in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``Don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) come; I don't like him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>).
<p/>As I did not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) either, I took the liberty of saying that we thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), but we didn't want seeing home.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) received that piece of information with a yell of laughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a little distance.
<p/>Curious to know whether Biddy suspected him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) of having had a hand in that murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any account, I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) why she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>).
<p/>This penalty of being jiggered was a favorite supposititious case of his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) replied, glancing over her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) shoulder as he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) slouched after us, <div class="bookquote">``because I--I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) likes me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>No,'' said Biddy, glancing over her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) shoulder again, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) never told me so; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) dances at me, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) can catch my eye.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) ever tell you he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) liked you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked indignantly. '' '' However novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not doubt the accuracy of the interpretation.
<p/>I was very hot indeed upon Old Orlick's daring to admire her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); as hot as if it were an outrage on myself.
<p/>'' But it makes no difference to you, you know,'' said Biddy, calmly. '' No, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I don't like it; I don't approve of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but I must tell you I should have no opinion of you, Biddy, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) danced at you with your own consent.
<p/>I kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances were favorable to his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) dancing at Biddy, got before him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) to obscure that demonstration.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had struck root in Joe's establishment, by reason of my sister's sudden fancy for him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), or I should have tried to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) dismissed.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Nor I neither,'' said Biddy. '' Though that makes no difference to you. '' <div class="bookquote">``Exactly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, as I had reason to know thereafter.
<p/>, I complicated its confusion fifty thousand-fold, by having states and seasons when I was clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella, and that the plain honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to be ashamed of, but offered me sufficient means of self-respect and happiness.
<p/>At those times, I would decide conclusively that my disaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone, and that I was growing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep company with Biddy,--when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the Havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile, and scatter my wits again.
<p/>Scattered wits take a long time picking up; and often before I had got them well together, they would be dispersed in all directions by one stray thought, that perhaps after all Miss Havisham was going to make my fortune when my time was out.
<p/>If my time had run out, it would have left me still at the height of my perplexities, I dare say.
<p/>And now, because my mind was not confused enough before It never did run out, however, but was brought to a premature end, as I proceed to relate.
<p/>There was a group assembled round the fire at the Three Jolly Bargemen, attentive to Mr. Wopsle as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) read the newspaper aloud.
<p/>Chapter XVIII It was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe, and it was a Saturday night. Of that group I was one.
<p/>A highly popular murder had been committed, and Mr. Wopsle was imbrued in blood to the eyebrows. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) gloated over every abhorrent adjective in the description, and identified himself with every witness at the Inquest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) faintly moaned, <div class="bookquote">``I am done for,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>as the victim, and he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) barbarously bellowed, <div class="bookquote">``I'll serve you out,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as the murderer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) gave the medical testimony, in pointed imitation of our local practitioner; and he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) piped and shook, as the aged turnpike-keeper who had heard blows, to an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental competency of that witness.
<p/>The coroner, in Mr. Wopsle's hands, became Timon of Athens; the beadle, Coriolanus. He (<font color='blue'><b>beadle</b></font>) enjoyed himself thoroughly, and we all enjoyed ourselves, and were delightfully comfortable.
<p/>Then, and not sooner, I became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over the back of the settle opposite me, looking on.
<p/>There was an expression of contempt on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bit the side of a great forefinger as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) watched the group of faces.
<p/>Well!'' said the stranger to Mr. Wopsle, when the reading was done, <div class="bookquote">``you have settled it all to your own satisfaction, I have no doubt?
<p/>In this cosey state of mind we came to the verdict Wilful Murder. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>'' Everybody started and looked up, as if it were the murderer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) looked at everybody coldly and sarcastically. '' Guilty, of course?'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>). '' Out with it. Come!'' <div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Wopsle, <div class="bookquote">``without having the honor of your acquaintance, I do say Guilty.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>Upon this we all took courage to unite in a confirmatory murmur. '' I know you do,'' said the stranger; <div class="bookquote">``I knew you would.
<p/>Do you know, or do you not know, that the law of England supposes every man to be innocent, until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is proved--proved--to be guilty?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><p/>I told you so. But now I'll ask you a question. <div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wopsle began to reply, <div class="bookquote">``as an Englishman myself,
<p/>I--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, biting his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) forefinger at him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>). '' Don't evade the question. Either you know it, or you don't know it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) head on one side and himself on one side, in a bullying, interrogative manner, and he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) forefinger at Mr. Wopsle,--as it were to mark him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) out--before biting it again.
<p/>Which is it to be? '' '' Now!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>). '' Do you know it, or don't you know it? ''
<p/>'' Certainly I know it,'' replied Mr. Wopsle. '' Certainly you know it. Then why didn't you say so at first?
<p/>Now, I'll ask you another question,''--taking possession of Mr. Wopsle, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) had a right to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>),--<div class="bookquote">``do you know that none of these witnesses have yet been cross-examined?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wopsle was beginning, <div class="bookquote">``I can only say--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>when the stranger stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>). '' What? You won't answer the question, yes or no?
<p/>Now, I'll try you again. '' Throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) finger at him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) again. '' Attend to me. Are you aware, or are you not aware, that none of these witnesses have yet been cross-examined?
<p/>Come, I only want one word from you. Yes, or no? '' Mr. Wopsle hesitated, and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, <div class="bookquote">``I'll help you. You don't deserve help, but I'll help you. Look at that paper you hold in your hand.
<p/>Is it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>pursued the stranger in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) most sarcastic and suspicious manner, <div class="bookquote">``the printed paper you have just been reading from?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, turn to that paper, and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) legal advisers instructed him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) altogether to reserve his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) defence?''
<p/>What is it?'' '' What is it?'' repeated Mr. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss. '' <div class="bookquote">``Undoubtedly.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Undoubtedly. <div class="bookquote">``I read that just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wopsle pleaded.
<p/>'' Never mind what you read just now, sir; I don't ask you what you read just now. You may read the Lord's Prayer backwards, if you like,--and, perhaps, have done it before to-day.
<p/>Turn to the paper. No, no, no my friend ; not to the top of the column; you know better than that; to the bottom, to the bottom.
<p/>'' -LRB-We all began to think Mr. Wopsle full of subterfuge.-RRB- '' Well? Have you found it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Here it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wopsle.
<p/>Now, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) was instructed by his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) legal advisers wholly to reserve his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) defence?
<p/>'' Come! Do you make that of it? '' Mr. Wopsle answered, <div class="bookquote">``Those are not the exact words. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not the exact words!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>repeated the gentleman bitterly.
<p/>Yes,'' repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the company with his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle.
<p/>And now I ask you what you say to the conscience of that man who, with that passage before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, can lay his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pillow after having pronounced a fellow-creature guilty, unheard?
<p/>We all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) was beginning to be found out.
<p/>'' Is that the exact substance?'' '' Yes,'' said Mr. Wopsle. '' '' '' '' And that same man, remember,'' pursued the gentleman, throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) finger at Mr. Wopsle
<p/>heavily,--<div class="bookquote">``that same man might be summoned as a juryman upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply committed himself, might return to the bosom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) family and lay his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) pillow, after deliberately swearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) would well and truly try the issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the prisoner at the bar, and would a true verdict give according to the evidence, so help him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) God!
<p/>We were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too far, and had better stop in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) reckless career while there was yet time.
<p/>The strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, and with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of us that would effectually do for each individual if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chose to disclose it, left the back of the settle, and came into the space between the two settles, in front of the fire, where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) remained standing, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) left hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pocket, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) biting the forefinger of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) right.
<p/>From information I have received,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), looking round at us as we all quailed before him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I have reason to believe there is a blacksmith among you, by name Joseph--or Joe--Gargery.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' Which is the man?'' <div class="bookquote">``Here is the man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. The strange gentleman beckoned him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) place, and Joe went.
<p/>The stranger did not recognize me, but I recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) as the gentleman I had met on the stairs, on the occasion of my second visit to Miss Havisham.
<p/>I had known him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) the moment I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) looking over the settle, and now that I stood confronting him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand upon my shoulder, I checked off again in detail his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) large head, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dark complexion, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) deep-set eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bushy black eyebrows, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) large watch-chain, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) strong black dots of beard and whisker, and even the smell of scented soap on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) great hand.
<p/>'' You have an apprentice,'' pursued the stranger, <div class="bookquote">``commonly known as Pip? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) here?''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am here!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried. ''
<p/>I wish to have a private conference with you two,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had surveyed me at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) leisure. ''
<p/>I prefer not to anticipate my communication here; you will impart as much or as little of it as you please to your friends afterwards; I have nothing to do with that.
<p/>It will take a little time. Perhaps we had better go to your place of residence. '' Amidst a wondering silence, we three walked out of the Jolly Bargemen, and in a wondering silence walked home.
<p/>As we neared home, Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as an impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the front door.
<p/>While going along, the strange gentleman occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) finger. Our conference was held in the state parlor, which was feebly lighted by one candle.
<p/>It began with the strange gentleman's sitting down at the table, drawing the candle to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and looking over some entries in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) pocket-book.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a little aside, after peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me, to ascertain which was which.
<p/>'' My name,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``is Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in London. I am pretty well known. I have unusual business to transact with you, and I commence by explaining that it is not of my originating.
<p/>If my advice had been asked, I should not have been here. It was not asked, and you see me here.
<p/>Finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could not see us very well from where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sat, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) got up, and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it; thus having one foot on the seat of the chair, and one foot on the ground.
<p/>What I have to do as the confidential agent of another, I do. No less, no more. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Now, Joseph Gargery, I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of this young fellow your apprentice.
<p/>You would not object to cancel his (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) indentures at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) request and for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) good? You would want nothing for so doing?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip's way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, staring. '' Lord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose,'' returned Mr. Jaggers.
<p/>'' The question is, Would you want anything? Do you want anything?'' '' The answer is,'' returned Joe, sternly, <div class="bookquote">``No. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) considered him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) a fool for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) disinterestedness. But I was too much bewildered between breathless curiosity and surprise, to be sure of it.
<p/>'' Very well,'' said Mr. Jaggers. '' Recollect the admission you have made, and don't try to go from it presently.
<p/>'' '' Who's a going to try?'' retorted Joe. '' I don't say anybody is. Do you keep a dog?'' ''
<p/>Yes, I do keep a dog.'' <div class="bookquote">``Bear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.
<p/>Bear that in mind, will you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Jaggers, shutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) eyes and nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head at Joe, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) were forgiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) something.
<p/>'' Now, I return to this young fellow. And the communication I have got to make is, that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has great expectations.
<p/>I am instructed to communicate to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>),'' said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) finger at me sideways, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) will come into a handsome property.
<p/>Further, that it is the desire of the present possessor of that property, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) be immediately removed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) present sphere of life and from this place, and be brought up as a gentleman,--in a word, as a young fellow of great expectations.
<p/>My dream was out; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality; Miss Havisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Joe and I gasped, and looked at one another. '' '' '' Now, Mr. Pip,'' pursued the lawyer, <div class="bookquote">``I address the rest of what I have to say, to you.
<p/>You are to understand, first, that it is the request of the person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear the name of Pip.
<p/>You will have no objection, I dare say, to your great expectations being encumbered with that easy condition. But if you have any objection, this is the time to mention it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>My heart was beating so fast, and there was such a singing in my ears, that I could scarcely stammer
<p/>Now you are to understand, secondly, Mr. Pip, that the name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound secret, until the person chooses to reveal it.
<p/>I am empowered to mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by word of mouth to yourself.
<p/>I had no objection. '' I should think not! When or where that intention may be carried out, I cannot say; no one can say.
<p/>Now, you are distinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from making any inquiry on this head, or any allusion or reference, however distant, to any individual whomsoever as the individual, in all the communications you may have with me.
<p/>It may be years hence. If you have a suspicion in your own breast, keep that suspicion in your own breast.
<p/>It is not the least to the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition are; they may be the strongest and gravest reasons, or they may be mere whim.
<p/>Your acceptance of it, and your observance of it as binding, is the only remaining condition that I am charged with, by the person from whom I take my instructions, and for whom I am not otherwise responsible.
<p/>That person is the person from whom you derive your expectations, and the secret is solely held by that person and by me.
<p/>Again, not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such a rise in fortune; but if you have any objection to it, this is the time to mention it.
<p/>This is not for you to inquire into. The condition is laid down. Speak out. '' Once more, I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection.
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) called me Mr. Pip, and began rather to make up to me, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) still could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion; and even now he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) occasionally shut his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) eyes and threw his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) finger at me while he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) spoke, as much as to express that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knew all kinds of things to my disparagement, if he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) only chose to mention them.
<p/>'' I should think not! Now, Mr. Pip, I have done with stipulations. '' '' We come next, to mere details of arrangement.
<p/>You must know that, although I have used the term `expectations' more than once, you are not endowed with expectations only.
<p/>There is already lodged in my hands a sum of money amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance. You will please consider me your guardian.
<p/>'' for I was going to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I tell you at once, I am paid for my services, or I shouldn't render them.
<p/>It is considered that you must be better educated, in accordance with your altered position, and that you will be alive to the importance and necessity of at once entering on that advantage.
<p/>Oh! ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>I said I had always longed for it. '' Never mind what you have always longed for, Mr. Pip,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) retorted; <div class="bookquote">``keep to the record.
<p/>If you long for it now, that's enough. Am I answered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper tutor?
<p/>Is that it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I stammered yes, that was it. '' Good. Now, your inclinations are to be consulted. I don't think that wise, mind, but it's my trust.
<p/>Have you ever heard of any tutor whom you would prefer to another? '' I had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt; so, I replied in the negative.
<p/>There is a certain tutor, of whom I have some knowledge, who I think might suit the purpose,'' said Mr. Jaggers.
<p/>'' '' I don't recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), observe; because I never recommend anybody. The gentleman I speak of is one Mr. Matthew Pocket.
<p/>'' Ah! I caught at the name directly. Miss Havisham's relation. The Matthew whom Mr. and Mrs. Camilla had spoken of.
<p/>The Matthew whose place was to be at Miss Havisham's head, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) lay dead, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) bride's dress on the bride's table.
<p/>You know the name?'' said Mr. Jaggers, looking shrewdly at me, and then shutting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) eyes while he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) waited for my answer.
<p/>'' My answer was, that I had heard of the name. '' Oh!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>). '' You have heard of the name.
<p/>But the question is, what do you say of it? '' I said, or tried to say, that I was much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) recommendation--
<p/>'' No, my young friend! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) interrupted, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) great head very slowly. <div class="bookquote">``Recollect yourself!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Not recollecting myself, I began again that I was much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) recommendation--
<p/>No, my young friend,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) interrupted, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) head and frowning and smiling both at once,--<div class="bookquote">``no, no, no; it's very well done, but it won't do; you are too young to fix me with it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Recommendation is not the word, Mr. Pip. Try another. '' Correcting myself, I said that I was much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) mention of Mr. Matthew Pocket--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's more like it! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pocket/Matthew/Mr. Matthew Pocket</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Jaggers.--And -LRB-I added-RRB-, I would gladly try that gentleman. '' Good. You had better try him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own house.
<p/>The way shall be prepared for you, and you can see his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) son first, who is in London. When will you come to London?
<p/>'' I said -LRB-glancing at Joe, who stood looking on, motionless-RRB-, that I supposed I could come directly. '' First,'' said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``you should have some new clothes to come in, and they should not be working-clothes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) produced a long purse, with the greatest coolness, and counted them out on the table and pushed them over to me.
<p/>Say this day week. You'll want some money. Shall I leave you twenty guineas?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>This was the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) leg from the chair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) sat astride of the chair when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had pushed the money over, and sat swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) purse and eyeing Joe.
<p/>'' Well, Joseph Gargery? You look dumbfoundered?'' <div class="bookquote">``I am!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, in a very decided manner. '' It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself, remember?''
<p/>But what,'' said Mr. Jaggers, swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) purse,--<div class="bookquote">``what if it was in my instructions to make you a present, as compensation?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>It were understood,'' said Joe. '' And it are understood. And it ever will be similar according.'' '' '' ''
<p/>As compensation what for?'' Joe demanded. '' For the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) services. '' Joe laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman.
<p/>I have often thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) since, like the steam-hammer that can crush a man or pat an egg-shell, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) combination of strength with gentleness.
<p/>Pip is that hearty welcome,'' said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``to go free with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) services, to honor and fortun', as no words can tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>).
<p/>But if you think as Money can make compensation to me for the loss of the little child--what come to the forge--and ever the best of friends!--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>O dear good Joe, whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to, I see you again, with your muscular blacksmith's arm before your eyes, and your broad chest heaving, and your voice dying away.
<p/>O dear good faithful tender Joe, I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm, as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel's wing!
<p/>'' But I encouraged Joe at the time. I was lost in the mazes of my future fortunes, and could not retrace the by-paths we had trodden together.
<p/>I begged Joe to be comforted, for -LRB-as he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) said-RRB- we had ever been the best of friends, and -LRB-as I said-RRB- we ever would be so.
<p/>Joe scooped his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) eyes with his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) disengaged wrist, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) were bent on gouging himself, but said not another word.
<p/>Mr. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognized in Joe the village idiot, and in me his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) keeper.
<p/>When it was over, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) said, weighing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hand the purse he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had ceased to swing:-- <div class="bookquote">``Now, Joseph Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance.
<p/>If you mean to take a present that I have it in charge to make you, speak out, and you shall have it.
<p/>Here, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) great amazement, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) was stopped by Joe's suddenly working round him (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic purpose.
<p/>No half measures with me. If on the contrary you mean to say-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Which I meantersay,'' cried Joe, <div class="bookquote">``that if you come into my place bull-baiting and badgering me, come out!
<p/>Which I meantersay as sech if you're a man, come on! Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersay and stand or fall by!
<p/>I drew Joe away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) immediately became placable; merely stating to me, in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any one whom it might happen to concern, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were not a going to be bull-baited and badgered in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own place.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Mr. Jaggers had risen when Joe demonstrated, and had backed near the door. Without evincing any inclination to come in again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) there delivered his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) valedictory remarks.
<p/>They were these. '' Well, Mr. Pip, I think the sooner you leave here--as you are to be a gentleman--the better.
<p/>Let it stand for this day week, and you shall receive my printed address in the meantime. You can take a hackney-coach at the stage-coach office in London, and come straight to me.
<p/>Understand, that I express no opinion, one way or other, on the trust I undertake. I am paid for undertaking it, and I do so.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) finger at both of us, and I think would have gone on, but for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off.
<p/>Something came into my head which induced me to run after him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was going down to the Jolly Bargemen, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) had left a hired carriage.
<p/>Now, understand that, finally. Understand that!'' '' I beg your pardon, Mr. Jaggers.'' <div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), facing round, <div class="bookquote">``what's the matter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish to be quite right, Mr. Jaggers, and to keep to your directions; so I thought I had better ask.
<p/>Would there be any objection to my taking leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>No,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), looking as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hardly understood me. '' I don't mean in the village only, but up town?''
<p/>I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) and ran home again, and there I found that Joe had already locked the front door and vacated the state parlor, and was seated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently at the burning coals.
<p/>'' No,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>). '' No objection. '' I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals, and nothing was said for a long time.
<p/>My sister was in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cushioned chair in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) corner, and Biddy sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) needle-work before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat next Joe in the corner opposite my sister.
<p/>The more I looked into the glowing coals, the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; the longer the silence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) knees tight, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) had private information that they intended to make off somewhere, <div class="bookquote">``which I left it to yourself, Pip.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At length I got out, <div class="bookquote">``Joe, have you told Biddy?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I would rather you told, Joe.''  (<font color='red'><b>Pip/Mr. Pip</b></font>)</div>'' Pip's a gentleman of fortun' then,'' said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``and God bless him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Biddy dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) work, and looked at me. Joe held his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knees and looked at me. I looked at both of them.
<p/>After a pause, they both heartily congratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their congratulations that I rather resented.
<p/>I took it upon myself to impress Biddy -LRB-and through Biddy, Joe-RRB- with the grave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing and say nothing about the maker of my fortune.
<p/>It would all come out in good time, I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said, save that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron.
<p/>Biddy nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head thoughtfully at the fire as she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) work again, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) would be very particular; and Joe, still detaining his (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) knees, said, <div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, I'll be ekervally partickler, Pip;''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>and then they congratulated me again, and went on to express so much wonder at the notion of my being a gentleman that I didn't half like it.
<p/>Infinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some idea of what had happened. To the best of my belief, those efforts entirely failed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) laughed and nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) head a great many times, and even repeated after Biddy, the words <div class="bookquote">``Pip''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Property. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div><p/>But I doubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry, and I cannot suggest a darker picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) state of mind.
<p/>I never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and Biddy became more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy.
<p/>Dissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be; but it is possible that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfied with myself.
<p/>Any how, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand, looking into the fire, as those two talked about my going away, and about what they should do without me, and all that.
<p/>And whenever I caught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly -LRB-and they often looked at me,--particularly Biddy-RRB-, I felt offended: as if they were expressing some mistrust of me.
<p/>At those times I would get up and look out at the door; for our kitchen door opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer evenings to air the room.
<p/>The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I am afraid I took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic objects among which I had passed my life.
<p/>Though Heaven knows they never did by word or sign. '' Saturday night,'' said I, when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese and beer.
<p/>'' Five more days, and then the day before the day! They'll soon go. '' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) beer-mug.
<p/>I have been thinking, Joe, that when I go down town on Monday, and order my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I'll come and put them on there, or that I'll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook's.
<p/>'' They'll soon go. '' <div class="bookquote">``Soon, soon go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy. '' It would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel figure too, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, industriously cutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) bread, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) cheese on it, in the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) left hand, and glancing at my untasted supper as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) thought of the time when we used to compare slices.
<p/>'' So might Wopsle. And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment.'' '' That's just what I don't want, Joe.
<p/>They would make such a business of it,--such a coarse and common business,--that I couldn't bear myself.'' '' Ah, that indeed, Pip!'' said Joe.
<p/>If you couldn't abear yourself--'' Biddy asked me here, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) sat holding my sister's plate, <div class="bookquote">``Have you thought about when you'll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and your sister and me?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>You will show yourself to us; won't you?'' '' Biddy,'' I returned with some resentment, <div class="bookquote">``you are so exceedingly quick that it's difficult to keep up with you.
<p/>If you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say that I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,--most likely on the evening before I go away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' -LRB-<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) always were quick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>observed Joe.-RRB- '' Biddy said no more. Handsomely forgiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), I soon exchanged an affectionate good night with her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) and Joe, and went up to bed.
<p/>When I got into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a mean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above, for ever.
<p/>It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even at the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind between it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in so often between the forge and Miss Havisham's, and Biddy and Estella.
<p/>As I put the window open and stood looking out, I saw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or two in the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) a pipe and light it for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wanted comforting, for some reason or other.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pipe, and Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and I knew that they talked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both of them more than once.
<p/>I would not have listened for more, if I could have heard more; so I drew away from the window, and sat down in my one chair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest I had ever known.
<p/>Looking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joe's pipe floating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,--not obtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared together.
<p/>I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an uneasy bed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.
<p/>Chapter XIX Morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life, and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same.
<p/>What lay heaviest on my mind was, the consideration that six days intervened between me and the day of departure; for I could not divest myself of a misgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile, and that, when I got there, it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean gone.
<p/>Joe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our approaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did.
<p/>After breakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best parlor, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free.
<p/>With all the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church with Joe, and thought perhaps the clergyman wouldn't have read that about the rich man and the kingdom of Heaven, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had known all.
<p/>After our early dinner, I strolled out alone, purposing to finish off the marshes at once, and get them done with.
<p/>As I passed the church, I felt -LRB-as I had felt during service in the morning-RRB- a sublime compassion for the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday after Sunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among the low green mounds.
<p/>I promised myself that I would do something for them one of these days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner of roast-beef and plum-pudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon of condescension, upon everybody in the village.
<p/>If I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of my companionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among those graves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when the place recalled the wretch, ragged and shivering, with his (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) felon iron and badge!
<p/>My comfort was, that it happened a long time ago, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) had doubtless been transported a long way off, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) was dead to me, and might be veritably dead into the bargain.
<p/>The sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, and the room was warm. No more low, wet grounds, no more dikes and sluices, no more of these grazing cattle,--though
<p/>they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear a more respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they might stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great expectations,--farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood, henceforth I was for London and greatness; not for smith's work in general, and for you!
<p/>I made my exultant way to the old Battery, and, lying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havisham intended me for Estella, fell asleep.
<p/>When I awoke, I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me, smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>) pipe. He (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>) greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my eyes, and said,--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``As being the last time, Pip, I thought I'd foller.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' And Joe, I am very glad you did so.'' <div class="bookquote">``Thankee, Pip.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You may be sure, dear Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I went on, after we had shaken hands, <div class="bookquote">``that I shall never forget you.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no, Pip!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, in a comfortable tone, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure of that.
<p/>Ay, ay, old chap! Bless you, it were only necessary to get it well round in a man's mind, to be certain on it.
<p/>But it took a bit of time to get it well round, the change come so oncommon plump; didn't it? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>I should have liked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to have betrayed emotion, or to have said, <div class="bookquote">``It does you credit, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>or something of that sort.
<p/>Therefore, I made no remark on Joe's first head; merely saying as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) second, that the tidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had always wanted to be a gentleman, and had often and often speculated on what I would do, if I were one.
<p/>Somehow, I was not best pleased with Joe's being so mightily secure of me. '' Have you though?'' said Joe. <div class="bookquote">``Astonishing!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>It's a pity now, Joe,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``that you did not get on a little more, when we had our lessons here; isn't it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>It were always a pity as I was so awful dull; but it's no more of a pity now, than it was--this day twelvemonth--don't you see?
<p/>'' '' Well, I don't know,'' returned Joe. '' I'm so awful dull. I'm only master of my own trade. ''
<p/>What I had meant was, that when I came into my property and was able to do something for Joe, it would have been much more agreeable if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had been better qualified for a rise in station.
<p/>So, when we had walked home and had had tea, I took Biddy into our little garden by the side of the lane, and, after throwing out in a general way for the elevation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) spirits, that I should never forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), said I had a favor to ask of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was so perfectly innocent of my meaning, however, that I thought I would mention it to Biddy in preference. ''
<p/>And it is, Biddy,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``that you will not omit any opportunity of helping Joe on, a little. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How helping him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) on?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>asked Biddy, with a steady sort of glance. '' Well! Joe is a dear good fellow,--in fact , I think he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is the dearest fellow that ever lived,--but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is rather backward in some things.
<p/>Although I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) eyes very wide when I had spoken, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) did not look at me.
<p/>For instance, Biddy, in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) learning and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) manners. '' '' O, his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) manners! won't his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) manners do then?'' asked Biddy, plucking a black-currant leaf.
<p/>'' My dear Biddy, they do very well here-- '' <div class="bookquote">``O! they do very well here? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>interrupted Biddy, looking closely at the leaf in her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) hand.
<p/>out,--but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as I shall hope to remove him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) when I fully come into my property, they would hardly do him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) justice.''
<p/>It was such a very provoking question -LRB-for it had never in the most distant manner occurred to me-RRB-, that I said,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hear me ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And don't you think he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knows that?'' asked Biddy. snappishly,-- '' Biddy, what do you mean? '' Biddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
<p/>the smell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening in the little garden by the side of the lane,--said, <div class="bookquote">``Have you never considered that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) may be proud?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>O! there are many kinds of pride,'' said Biddy, looking full at me and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head; ``pride is not all of one kind--
<p/>hands,--and <div class="bookquote">``Proud? ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I repeated, with disdainful emphasis. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Well? What are you stopping for?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Not all of one kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>resumed Biddy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) may be too proud to let any one take him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) out of a place that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is competent to fill, and fills well and with respect.
<p/>To tell you the truth, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is; though it sounds bold in me to say so, for you must know him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) far better than I do.''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Now, Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry to see this in you. I did not expect to see this in you.
<p/>You are envious, Biddy, and grudging. You are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you can't help showing it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' If you have the heart to think so,'' returned Biddy, <div class="bookquote">``say so. Say so over and over again, if you have the heart to think so.
<p/>If you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said I, in a virtuous and superior tone; <div class="bookquote">``don't put it off upon me.
<p/>I did intend to ask you to use any little opportunities you might have after I was gone, of improving dear Joe.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I am very sorry to see it, and it's a --it's a bad side of human nature. But after this I ask you nothing.
<p/>I am extremely sorry to see this in you, Biddy,'' I repeated. '' It's a--it's a bad side of human nature.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whether you scold me or approve of me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>returned poor Biddy, <div class="bookquote">``you may equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power, here, at all times.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>And whatever opinion you take away of me, shall make no difference in my remembrance of you. Yet a gentleman should not be unjust neither,'' said Biddy, turning away her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head.
<p/>I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature -LRB-in which sentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason to think I was right-RRB-, and I walked down the little path away from Biddy, and Biddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate and took a dejected stroll until supper-time; again feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this, the second night of my bright fortunes, should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first.
<p/>Putting on the best clothes I had, I went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open, and presented myself before Mr. Trabb, the tailor, who was having his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) breakfast in the parlor behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) shop, and who did not think it worth his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) while to come out to me, but called me into him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>).
<p/>But, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my clemency to Biddy, and we dropped the subject. '' Well!'' said Mr. Trabb, in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way.
<p/>Mr. Trabb had sliced his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) hot roll into three feather-beds, and was slipping butter in between the blankets, and covering it up.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) was a prosperous old bachelor, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) open window looked into a prosperous little garden and orchard, and there was a prosperous iron safe let into the wall at the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) fireplace, and I did not doubt that heaps of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) prosperity were put away in it in bags.
<p/>Mr. Trabb,'' said I, ``it's an unpleasant thing to have to mention, because it looks like boasting; but I have come into a handsome property.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) forgot the butter in bed, got up from the bedside, and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) fingers on the tablecloth, exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">``Lord bless my soul!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am going up to my guardian in London,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, casually drawing some guineas out of my pocket and looking at them; <div class="bookquote">``and I want a fashionable suit of clothes to go in.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>How are you, and what can I do for you?'' '' '' A change passed over Mr. Trabb. I wish to pay for them,'' I added--otherwise I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) might only pretend to make them, <div class="bookquote">``with ready money.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>My dear sir,'' said Mr. Trabb, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) respectfully bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) body, opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each elbow, <div class="bookquote">``don't hurt me by mentioning that.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>May I venture to congratulate you? Would you do me the favor of stepping into the shop? '' Mr. Trabb's boy was the most audacious boy in all that country-side.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) was still sweeping when I came out into the shop with Mr. Trabb, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) knocked the broom against all possible corners and obstacles, to express -LRB-as I understood it-RRB- equality with any blacksmith, alive or dead.
<p/>Hold that noise,'' said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, <div class="bookquote">``or I'll knock your head off!--Do me the favor to be seated, sir.
<p/>Now, this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Trabb/Mr. Trabb</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out in a flowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) hand under it to show the gloss, <div class="bookquote">``is a very sweet article.
<p/>When I had entered he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) was sweeping the shop, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) had sweetened his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) labors by sweeping over me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Trabb/Mr. Trabb</b></font>)</div>I can recommend it for your purpose, sir, because it really is extra super.
<p/>-LRB-To the boy, and with a dreadfully severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant's brushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.-RRB-
<p/>Mr. Trabb never removed his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) stern eye from the boy until he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) had deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again.
<p/>But you shall see some others. Give me Number Four, you!'' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) to bring number five, and number eight.
<p/>And let me have none of your tricks here,'' said Mr. Trabb, <div class="bookquote">``or you shall repent it, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live.
<p/>Mr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferential confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, an article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that it would ever be an honor to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) to reflect upon a distinguished fellow-townsman's -LRB-if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentry</b></font>) might claim me for a fellow-townsman-RRB- having worn.
<p/>Are you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond,''  (<font color='red'><b>Trabb/Mr. Trabb</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Trabb to the boy after that, ``or shall I kick you out of the shop and bring them myself?
<p/>I selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr. Trabb's judgment, and re-entered the parlor to be measured.
<p/>For although Mr. Trabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented with it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) said apologetically that it ``wouldn't do under existing circumstances, sir,--wouldn't do at all.
<p/>So, Mr. Trabb measured and calculated me in the parlor, as if I were an estate and he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) the finest species of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that I felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) pains.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) had at last done and had appointed to send the articles to Mr. Pumblechook's on the Thursday evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) said, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hand upon the parlor lock, <div class="bookquote">``I know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot be expected to patronize local work, as a rule; but if you would give me a turn now and then in the quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteem it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' Good morning, sir, much obliged.--Door! '' The last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion what it meant.
<p/>But I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) collapse as his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) master rubbed me out with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money was, that it had morally laid upon his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) back Trabb's boy.
<p/>After this memorable event, I went to the hatter's, and the bootmaker's, and the hosier's, and felt rather like Mother Hubbard's dog whose outfit required the services of so many trades.
<p/>It was not necessary to explain everywhere that I had come into a handsome property; but whenever I said anything to that effect, it followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) attention diverted through the window by the High Street, and concentrated his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) mind upon me.
<p/>When I had ordered everything I wanted, I directed my steps towards Pumblechook's, and, as I approached that gentleman's place of business, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) standing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) door.
<p/>I also went to the coach-office and took my place for seven o'clock on Saturday morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was waiting for me with great impatience.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had prepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnwell</b></font>) too ordered his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnwell</b></font>) shopman to <div class="bookquote">``come out of the gangway''  (<font color='red'><b>shopman</b></font>)</div>as my sacred person passed.
<p/>My dear friend,'' said Mr. Pumblechook, taking me by both hands, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) and I and the collation were alone, <div class="bookquote">``I give you joy of your good fortune.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had been out early with the chaise-cart, and had called at the forge and heard the news. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Well deserved, well deserved!
<p/>To think,'' said Mr. Pumblechook, after snorting admiration at me for some moments, <div class="bookquote">``that I should have been the humble instrument of leading up to this, is a proud reward.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>This was coming to the point, and I thought it a sensible way of expressing himself. '' '' I begged Mr. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or hinted, on that point.
<p/>My dear young friend,'' said Mr. Pumblechook; <div class="bookquote">``if you will allow me to call you so--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>I murmured <div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both hands again, and communicated a movement to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) waistcoat, which had an emotional appearance, though it was rather low down, <div class="bookquote">``My dear young friend, rely upon my doing my little all in your absence, by keeping the fact before the mind of Joseph.--Joseph!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' said Mr. Pumblechook, in the way of a compassionate adjuration. <div class="bookquote">``Joseph!! Joseph!!! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Thereupon he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) head and tapped it, expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) sense of deficiency in Joseph.
<p/>Here is a chicken had round from the Boar, here is a tongue had round from the Boar, here's one or two little things had round from the Boar,
<p/>'' But my dear young friend,'' said Mr. Pumblechook, <div class="bookquote">``you must be hungry, you must be exhausted. Be seated. that I hope you may not despise.
<p/>But do I,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again the moment after he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had sat down, <div class="bookquote">``see afore me, him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) as I ever sported with in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) times of happy infancy?
<p/>And may I--may I--? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This May I, meant might he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) shake hands? I consented, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was fervent, and then sat down again.
<p/>'' Here is wine,'' said Mr. Pumblechook. <div class="bookquote">``Let us drink, Thanks to Fortune, and may she (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) ever pick out her (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) favorites with equal judgment!
<p/>And yet I cannot,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again, <div class="bookquote">``see afore me One--and likewise drink to One--without again expressing-- May I--may I--?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>I said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) might, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) shook hands with me again, and emptied his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) glass and turned it upside down.
<p/>I did the same; and if I had turned myself upside down before drinking, the wine could not have gone more direct to my head.
<p/>Mr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice of tongue -LRB-none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now-RRB-, and took, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at all.
<p/>You little thought,'' said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophizing the fowl in the dish, <div class="bookquote">``when you was a young fledgling, what was in store for you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>Ah! poultry, poultry! You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this humble roof for one as --Call it a weakness, if you will,'' said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again, <div class="bookquote">``but may I? may I--?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>It began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) might, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) did it at once. How he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) ever did it so often without wounding himself with my knife, I don't know.
<p/>'' And your sister,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) resumed, after a little steady eating, <div class="bookquote">``which had the honor of bringing you up by hand!
<p/>It's a sad picter, to reflect that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s no longer equal to fully understanding the honor.

<p/>'' We'll drink her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) health,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Pumblechook, leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) chair, quite flaccid with admiration, ``that's the way you know 'em, sir!
<p/>-LRB-I don't know who Sir was, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) certainly was not I, and there was no third person present-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``that's the way you know
<p/>It might,''  (<font color='red'><b>no person</b></font>)</div>said the servile Pumblechook, putting down his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, <div class="bookquote">``to a common person, have the appearance of repeating--but may I--?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>the noble-minded, sir! Ever forgiving and ever affable. '' When he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had done it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) seat and drank to my sister.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us never be blind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Pumblechook, <div class="bookquote">``to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) faults of temper, but it is to be hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) meant well.
<p/>At about this time, I began to observe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was getting flushed in the face; as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting.
<p/>I mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes sent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>I mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) lauded it to the skies. There was nobody but himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) intimated, worthy of my confidence, and--in short, might he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>)?
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) asked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums, and how we had gone together to have me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had ever been my favorite fancy and my chosen friend?
<p/>If I had taken ten times as many glasses of wine as I had, I should have known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) never had stood in that relation towards me, and should in my heart of hearts have repudiated the idea.
<p/>Yet for all that, I remember feeling convinced that I had been much mistaken in him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was a sensible, practical, good-hearted prime fellow.
<p/>By degrees he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) fell to reposing such great confidence in me, as to ask my advice in reference to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) own affairs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) mentioned that there was an opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed trade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had never occurred before in that or any other neighborhood.
<p/>What alone was wanting to the realization of a vast fortune, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) considered to be More Capital. Those were the two little words, more capital.
<p/>Now it appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) -LRB-Pumblechook-RRB- that if that capital were got into the business, through a sleeping partner, sir,--which sleeping partner would have nothing to do but walk in, by self or deputy, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) pleased, and examine the books,--and walk in twice a year and take his (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) profits away in his (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) pocket, to the tune of fifty per cent,--it appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>deputy</b></font>) that that might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with property, which would be worthy of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) attention.
<p/>But what did I think? He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think? I gave it as my opinion.
<p/>The united vastness and distinctness of this view so struck him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) no longer asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might shake hands with me, but said he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) really must,--and did.
<p/>We drank all the wine, and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over and over again to keep Joseph up to the mark -LRB-I don't know what mark-RRB-, and to render me efficient and constant service
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) also made known to me for the first time in my life, and certainly after having kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) secret wonderfully well, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had always said of me, <div class="bookquote">``That boy is no common boy, and mark me, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fortun' will be no common fortun'.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to think of now, and I said so too.
<p/>Finally, I went out into the air, with a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the sunshine, and found that I had slumberously got to the turnpike without having taken any account of the road.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Wait a bit!'' -LRB-I don't know what service-RRB-. '' There, I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook's hailing me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was a long way down the sunny street, and was making expressive gestures for me to stop.
<p/>I stopped, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) came up breathless. '' No, my dear friend,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had recovered wind for speech.
<p/>'' Not if I can help it. This occasion shall not entirely pass without that affability on your part.--May I, as an old friend and well-wisher?
<p/>We shook hands for the hundredth time at least, and he (<font color='blue'><b>well-wisher</b></font>) ordered a young carter out of my way with the greatest indignation.
<p/>Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>well-wisher</b></font>) blessed me and stood waving his (<font color='blue'><b>well-wisher</b></font>) hand to me until I had passed the crook in the road; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge before I pursued my way home.
<p/>I had scant luggage to take with me to London, for little of the little I possessed was adapted to my new station.
<p/>But I began packing that same afternoon, and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want next morning, in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost.
<p/>So, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, passed; and on Friday morning I went to Mr. Pumblechook's, to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to Miss Havisham.
<p/>Mr. Pumblechook's own room was given up to me to dress in, and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event.
<p/>Probably every new and eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in, fell a trifle short of the wearer's expectation.
<p/>But after I had had my new suit on some half an hour, and had gone through an immensity of posturing with Mr. Pumblechook's very limited dressing-glass, in the futile endeavor to see my legs, it seemed to fit me better.
<p/>May I? '' My clothes were rather a disappointment, of course. It being market morning at a neighboring town some ten miles off, Mr. Pumblechook was not at home.
<p/>I had not told him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) exactly when I meant to leave, and was not likely to shake hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) again before departing.
<p/>This was all as it should be, and I went out in my new array, fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman, and suspicious after all that I was at a personal disadvantage, something like Joe's in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) Sunday suit.
<p/>I went circuitously to Miss Havisham's by all the back ways, and rang at the bell constrainedly, on account of the stiff long fingers of my gloves.
<p/>Sarah Pocket came to the gate, and positively reeled back when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) saw me so changed; her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) walnut-shell countenance likewise turned from brown to green and yellow.
<p/>'' You?'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>). '' You? Good gracious! What do you want?'' <div class="bookquote">``I am going to London, Miss Pocket,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``and want to say good-bye to Miss Havisham.
<p/>I was not expected, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) left me locked in the yard, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) went to ask if I were to be admitted.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>After a very short delay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) returned and took me up, staring at me all the way. Miss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread table, leaning on her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) crutch stick.
<p/>The room was lighted as of yore, and at the sound of our entrance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stopped and turned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was then just abreast of the rotted bride-cake.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I start for London, Miss Havisham, to-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was exceedingly careful what I said, <div class="bookquote">``and I thought you would kindly not mind my taking leave of you.
<p/>This is a gay figure, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), making her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) crutch stick play round me, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), the fairy godmother who had changed me, were bestowing the finishing gift.
<p/>'' Don't go, Sarah,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) said. '' Well, Pip? '' '' '' '' I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss Havisham,'' I murmured.
<p/>'' And I am so grateful for it, Miss Havisham!'' <div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah, with delight.
<p/>'' I have seen Mr. Jaggers. I have heard about it, Pip. So you go to-morrow?'' '' Yes, Miss Havisham.'' ''
<p/>And you are adopted by a rich person?'' '' Yes, Miss Havisham.'' <div class="bookquote">``Not named?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No, Miss Havisham. '' '' And Mr. Jaggers is made your guardian?''
<p/>'' Yes, Miss Havisham. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) quite gloated on these questions and answers, so keen was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) enjoyment of Sarah Pocket's jealous dismay.
<p/>'' Well!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) went on; <div class="bookquote">``you have a promising career before you. Be good--deserve it--and abide by Mr. Jaggers's instructions. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) looked at me, and looked at Sarah, and Sarah's countenance wrung out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) watchful face a cruel smile. ''
<p/>Good-bye, Pip!--you will always keep the name of Pip, you know.'' '' Yes, Miss Havisham.'' <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Pip!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) hand, and I went down on my knee and put it to my lips.
<p/>I had not considered how I should take leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>); it came naturally to me at the moment to do this.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) looked at Sarah Pocket with triumph in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godmother, with both her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) crutch stick, standing in the midst of the dimly lighted room beside the rotten bride-cake that was hidden in cobwebs.
<p/>Sarah Pocket conducted me down, as if I were a ghost who must be seen out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) could not get over my appearance, and was in the last degree confounded.
<p/>I said <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Miss Pocket;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>but she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) merely stared, and did not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken.
<p/>Clear of the house, I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook's, took off my new clothes, made them into a bundle, and went back home in my older dress, carrying it--to speak the truth--much more at my ease too, though I had the bundle to carry.
<p/>And now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had run out fast and were gone, and to-morrow looked me in the face more steadily than I could look at it.
<p/>As the six evenings had dwindled away, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more appreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy.
<p/>On this last evening, I dressed my self out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in my splendor until bedtime.
<p/>We had a hot supper on the occasion, graced by the inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finish with.
<p/>I was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little hand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all alone.
<p/>I am afraid--sore afraid--that this purpose originated in my sense of the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to the coach together.
<p/>I had pretended with myself that there was nothing of this taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room on this last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me in the morning.
<p/>All night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places instead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now pigs, now men,--never horses.
<p/>We were all very low, and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits. I did not. Fantastic failures of journeys occupied me until the day dawned and the birds were singing.
<p/>Then, I got up and partly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and in taking it fell asleep.
<p/>Biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did not sleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when I started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon.
<p/>But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking of the teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go downstairs.
<p/>After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again, until Biddy called to me that I was late.
<p/>I got up from the meal, saying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me, <div class="bookquote">``Well! I suppose I must be off!
<p/>and then I kissed my sister who was laughing and nodding and shaking in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) usual chair, and kissed Biddy, and threw my arms around Joe's neck.
<p/>It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Then I took up my little portmanteau and walked out.
<p/>The last I saw of them was, when I presently heard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwing an old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe.
<p/>I stopped then, to wave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) strong right arm above his (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) head, crying huskily <div class="bookquote">``Hooroar!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>and Biddy put her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) apron to her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) face.
<p/>I walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I had supposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done to have had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the High Street.
<p/>But the village was very peaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to show me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and all beyond was so unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heave and sob I broke into tears.
<p/>It was by the finger-post at the end of the village, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, O my dear, dear friend!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts.
<p/>I whistled and made nothing of going. I was better after I had cried than before,--more sorry, more aware of my own ingratitude, more gentle.
<p/>So subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again in the course of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it was clear of the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would not get down when we changed horses and walk back, and have another evening at home, and a better parting.
<p/>We changed, and I had not made up my mind, and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to get down and walk back, when we changed again.
<p/>And while I was occupied with these deliberations, I would fancy an exact resemblance to Joe in some man coming along the road towards us, and my heart would beat high.--As if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could possibly be there!
<p/>We changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far to go back, and I went on.
<p/>If I had cried before, I should have had Joe with me then. And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and the world lay spread before me.
<p/>This is the end of the first stage of Pip's expectations. Chapter XX The journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five hours.
<p/>It was a little past midday when the four-horse stage-coach by which I was a passenger, got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about the Cross Keys, Wood Street, Cheapside, London.
<p/>We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything: otherwise, while I was scared by the immensity of London, I think I might have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly, crooked, narrow, and dirty.
<p/>Mr. Jaggers had duly sent me his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) address; it was, Little Britain, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had written after it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) card, <div class="bookquote">``just out of Smithfield, and close by the coach-office.
<p/>Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who seemed to have as many capes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) greasy great-coat as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was years old, packed me up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of steps, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) were going to take me fifty miles.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) getting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) box, which I remember to have been decorated with an old weather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite a work of time.
<p/>It was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronets outside, and ragged things behind for I don't know how many footmen to hold on by, and a harrow below them, to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the temptation.
<p/>I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a straw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why the horses' nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachman beginning to get down, as if we were going to stop presently.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And stop we presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an open door, whereon was painted MR.
<p/>JAGGERS. '' How much? '' I asked the coachman. The coachman answered, <div class="bookquote">``A shilling--unless you wish to make it more. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>The coachman</b></font>)</div><p/>I naturally said I had no wish to make it more. '' Then it must be a shilling,'' observed the coachman.
<p/>'' I don't want to get into trouble. I know him (<font color='blue'><b>JAGGERS</b></font>)!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>JAGGERS</b></font>) darkly closed an eye at Mr. Jaggers's name, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had got his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) shilling, and had in course of time completed the ascent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) box, and had got away -LRB-which appeared to relieve his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) mind-RRB-, I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my hand and asked,
<p/>Was Mr. Jaggers at home? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) is not,'' returned the clerk. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) is in Court at present. Am I addressing Mr. Pip?
<p/>'' I signified that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was addressing Mr. Pip. '' Mr. Jaggers left word, would you wait in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) couldn't say how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) might be, having a case on.
<p/>But it stands to reason, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) time being valuable, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) won't be longer than he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) can help. '' With those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an inner chamber at the back.
<p/>Here, we found a gentleman with one eye, in a velveteen suit and knee-breeches, who wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nose with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sleeve on being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper.
<p/>I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting, when the clerk shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used, and tossing his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fur cap out after him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), left me alone.
<p/>Mr. Jaggers's room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a most dismal place; the skylight, eccentrically pitched like a broken head, and the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to peep down at me through it.
<p/>There were not so many papers about, as I should have expected to see; and there were some odd objects about, that I should not have expected to see,--such as an old rusty pistol, a sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and packages, and two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly swollen, and twitchy about the nose.
<p/>Mr. Jaggers's own high-backed chair was of deadly black horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it, like a coffin; and I fancied I could see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) leaned back in it, and bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) forefinger at the clients.
<p/>The room was but small, and the clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall; the wall, especially opposite to Mr. Jaggers's chair, being greasy with shoulders.
<p/>I recalled, too, that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) being turned out.
<p/>I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers's chair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place.
<p/>I called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to everybody else's disadvantage, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) master had.
<p/>I wondered how many other clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to have the same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures.
<p/>'' Go and wait outside, Mike,'' said the clerk. I wondered what was the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came there.
<p/>I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers's family, and, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such ill-looking relations, why he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) stuck them on that dusty perch for the blacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home.
<p/>Of course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits may have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and grit that lay thick on everything.
<p/>But I sat wondering and waiting in Mr. Jaggers's close room, until I really could not bear the two casts on the shelf above Mr. Jaggers's chair, and got up and went out.
<p/>When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I waited, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) advised me to go round the corner
<p/>So I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to me.
<p/>So, I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul's bulging at me from behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate Prison.
<p/>Following the wall of the jail, I found the roadway covered with straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles; and from this, and from the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spirits and beer, I inferred that the trials were on.
<p/>While I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk minister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a trial or so: informing me that he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) could give me a front place for half a crown, whence
<p/>I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) wig and robes,--mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, and presently offering him (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) at the reduced price of eighteen-pence.
<p/>As I declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) was so good as to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept, and also where people were publicly whipped, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Chief</b></font>) showed me the Debtors' Door, out of which culprits came to be hanged; heightening the interest of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that <div class="bookquote">``four on 'em''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>would come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight in the morning, to be killed in a row.
<p/>This was horrible, and gave me a sickening idea of London; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice's proprietor wore -LRB-from his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) hat down to his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) boots and up again to his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief inclusive-RRB- mildewed clothes which had evidently not belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) originally, and which I took it into my head he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) had bought cheap of the executioner.
<p/>I dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet, and I found he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had not, and I strolled out again.
<p/>This time, I made the tour of Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I became aware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well as I.
<p/>There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew Close, and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the pavement as they talked together, one of whom said to the other when they first passed me, that ``Jaggers would do it if it was to be done.
<p/>There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner, and one of the women was crying on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dirty shawl, and the other comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) by saying, as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own shawl over her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) shoulders, <div class="bookquote">``Jaggers is for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), `Melia, and what more could you have?
<p/>and I should come into Smithfield. Under these circumstances I thought myself well rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) for a shilling. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>There was a red-eyed little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering there, in company with a second little Jew whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) sent upon an errand; and while the messenger was gone, I remarked this Jew, who was of a highly excitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety under a lamp-post and accompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy, with the words, <div class="bookquote">``O Jaggerth, Jaggerth, Jaggerth!
<p/>These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep impression on me, and I admired and wondered more than ever.
<p/>At length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close into Little Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towards me.
<p/>all otherth ith Cag-Maggerth, give me Jaggerth!''  (<font color='red'><b>this Jew</b></font>)</div>All the others who were waiting saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) at the same time, and there was quite a rush at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>).
<p/>Mr. Jaggers, putting a hand on my shoulder and walking me on at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) side without saying anything to me, addressed himself to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) followers.
<p/>First, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) took the two secret men. '' Now, I have nothing to say to you,'' said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) finger at them.
<p/>'' I want to know no more than I know. As to the result, it's a toss-up. I told you from the first it was a toss-up.
<p/>We made the money up this morning, sir,'' said one of the men, submissively, while the other perused Mr. Jaggers's face.
<p/>Have you paid Wemmick?'' '' '' I don't ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made it up at all.
<p/>Has Wemmick got it?'' '' Yes, sir,'' said both the men together. '' Very well; then you may go. Now, I won't have it!'' said Mr Jaggers, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hand at them to put them behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>).
<p/>'' If you say a word to me, I'll throw up the case.'' <div class="bookquote">``We thought, Mr. Jaggers--''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>one of the men began, pulling off his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hat.
<p/>'' That's what I told you not to do,'' said Mr. Jaggers. '' You thought! I think for you; that's enough for you.
<p/>If I want you, I know where to find you; I don't want you to find me. Now I won't have it.
<p/>The two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind again, and humbly fell back and were heard no more.
<p/>And now you!'' said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on the two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meekly separated,--<div class="bookquote">``Oh!
<p/>I won't hear a word. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>'' Amelia, is it?'' '' Yes, Mr. Jaggers. '' '' And do you remember,'' retorted Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``that
<p/>but for me you wouldn't be here and couldn't be here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>'' O yes, sir! '' exclaimed both women together. ''
<p/>Lord bless you, sir, well we knows that!'' '' Then why,'' said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``do you come here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>'' My Bill, sir!''
<p/>the crying woman pleaded. '' Now, I tell you what!'' said Mr. Jaggers. '' Once for all. If you don't know that your Bill's in good hands, I know it.
<p/>And if you come here bothering about your Bill, I'll make an example of both your Bill and you, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) slip through my fingers.
<p/>Have you paid Wemmick?'' '' O yes, sir! Every farden.'' <div class="bookquote">``Very well. Then you have done all you have got to do.
<p/>Say another word--one single word--and Wemmick shall give you your money back. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>This terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately.
<p/>No one remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised the skirts of Mr. Jaggers's coat to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) lips several times.
<p/>'' I don't know this man!'' said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastating strain: <div class="bookquote">``What does this fellow want?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>'' Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth.
<p/>Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth?'' '' Who's he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)?'' said Mr. Jaggers. '' Let go of my coat. '' The suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing it, replied, <div class="bookquote">``Habraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate.''
 (<font color='red'><b>The suitor</b></font>)</div><p/>'' You're too late,'' said Mr. Jaggers. '' I am over the way.'' <div class="bookquote">``Holy father, Mithter Jaggerth!''  (<font color='red'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)</div>cried my excitable acquaintance, turning white, <div class="bookquote">``don't thay you're again Habraham Latharuth!''
 (<font color='red'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR.

<p/>My guardian threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) supplicant off with supreme indifference, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot.
<p/>Without further interruption, we reached the front office, where we found the clerk and the man in velveteen with the fur cap.

<p/>Oh!'' said Mr. Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a lock of hair in the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) forehead, like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling at the bell-rope; <div class="bookquote">``your man comes on this afternoon.
<p/>Well, Mas'r Jaggers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cock Robin</b></font>)</div>returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer from a constitutional cold; <div class="bookquote">``arter a deal o' trouble, I've found one, sir, as might do.
<p/>Here's Mike,''  (<font color='red'><b>a sufferer</b></font>)</div>said the clerk, getting down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) stool, and approaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially. '' Well?'' '' '' '' What is he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) prepared to swear?''
<p/>'' Well, Mas'r Jaggers,'' said Mike, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) nose on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) fur cap this time; <div class="bookquote">``in a general way, anythink. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mike</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, I warned you before,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>), throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) forefinger at the terrified client, <div class="bookquote">``that if you ever presumed to talk in that way here, I'd make an example of you.
<p/>Mr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the client</b></font>)</div>You infernal scoundrel, how dare you tell ME that? '' The client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) were unconscious what he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) had done.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Spooney!''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>said the clerk, in a low voice, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) a stir with his (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) elbow. '' Soft Head! Need you say it face to face?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I ask you, you blundering booby,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, very sternly, ``once more and for the last time, what the man you have brought here is prepared to swear?

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mike looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the ceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, before beginning to reply in a nervous manner,

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What? You WILL, will you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>-LRB-<div class="bookquote">``Spooney!''  (<font color='red'><b>the clerk</b></font>)</div>added the clerk again, with another stir.-RRB- After some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again:--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) is dressed like a `spectable pieman. A sort of a pastry-cook.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mike</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) here?''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>asked my guardian. '' I left him (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>),'' said Mike, ``a setting on some doorsteps round the corner.
<p/>We all three went to it, behind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an accidental manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a short suit of white linen and a paper cap.
<p/>This guileless confectioner was not by any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery, which was painted over.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) to take his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) witness away directly,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>said my guardian to the clerk, in extreme disgust, ``and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) means by bringing such a fellow as that.
<p/>My guardian then took me into his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) own room, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) lunched, standing, from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) seemed to bully his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) very sandwich as he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) ate it-RRB-, informed me what arrangements he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) had made for me.
<p/>I was to go to <div class="bookquote">``Barnard's Inn,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>to young Mr. Pocket's rooms, where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation; I was to remain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday; on Monday I was to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) father's house on a visit, that I might try how I liked it.
<p/>Also, I was told what my allowance was to be,--it was a very liberal one,--and had handed to me from one of my guardian's drawers, the cards of certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes, and such other things as I could in reason want.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Take him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) past that window, and let me see him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The window indicated was the office window. '' ''
<p/>You will find your credit good, Mr. Pip,'' said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt like a whole caskful, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) hastily refreshed himself, <div class="bookquote">``but I shall by this means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I find you outrunning the constable.
<p/>After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked Mr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach?
<p/>Of course you'll go wrong somehow, but that's no fault of mine. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) said it was not worth while , I was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me, if I pleased.
<p/>Another clerk was rung down from upstairs to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) place while he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was out, and I accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian.
<p/>We found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way among them by saying coolly yet decisively, <div class="bookquote">``I tell you it's no use; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) won't have a word to say to one of you;''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>and we soon got clear of them, and went on side by side.
<p/>Chapter XXI Casting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was like in the light of day, I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) to be a dry man, rather short in stature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have been imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel.
<p/>There were some marks in it that might have been dimples, if the material had been softer and the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints.
<p/>The chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) nose, but had given them up without an effort to smooth them off.
<p/>I judged him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) linen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) wore at least four mourning rings, besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it.
<p/>I noticed, too, that several rings and seals hung at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) watch-chain, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) were quite laden with remembrances of departed friends.
<p/>I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had glittering eyes,--small, keen, and black,--and thin wide mottled lips.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had had them, to the best of my belief, from forty to fifty years. '' So you were never in London before?'' said Mr. Wemmick to me.
<p/>'' No,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``I was new here once,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wemmick. '' Rum to think of now!'' <div class="bookquote">``You are well acquainted with it now?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wemmick. '' I know the moves of it.'' <div class="bookquote">``Is it a very wicked place? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, more for the sake of saying something than for information.
<p/>'' You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London. But there are plenty of people anywhere, who'll do that for you.
<p/>'' '' If there is bad blood between you and them,'' said I, to soften it off a little. '' O!
<p/>I don't know about bad blood,'' returned Mr. Wemmick; <div class="bookquote">``there's not much bad blood about. They'll do it, if there's anything to be got by it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hat on the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) head, and looked straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>): walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the streets to claim his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) attention.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That makes it worse. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Wemmick. '' Much about the same, I should say. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) mouth was such a post-office of a mouth that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had a mechanical appearance of smiling.
<p/>We had got to the top of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was not smiling at all.
<p/>'' Do you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives? '' I asked Mr. Wemmick. '' Yes,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), nodding in the direction.
<p/>'' At Hammersmith, west of London.'' <div class="bookquote">``Is that far?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well! Say five miles. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you know him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, you're a regular cross-examiner!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wemmick, looking at me with an approving air.
<p/>There was an air of toleration or depreciation about his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) utterance of these words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) said here we were at Barnard's Inn.
<p/>My depression was not alleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment to be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our town was a mere public-house.
<p/>Whereas I now found Barnard to be a disembodied spirit, or a fiction, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) inn the dingiest collection of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for Tom-cats.
<p/>We entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me like a flat burying-ground.
<p/>I thought it had the most dismal trees in it, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the most dismal houses -LRB-in number half a dozen or so-RRB-, that I had ever seen.
<p/>I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain, crippled flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable makeshift;
<p/>while To Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms, as if no new wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of Barnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel.
<p/>A frowzy mourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard, and it had strewn ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere dust-hole.
<p/>Thus far my sense of sight; while dry rot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar,--rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand besides--addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned, <div class="bookquote">``Try Barnard's Mixture.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Yes, I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>). I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>)! '' '' So imperfect was this realization of the first of my great expectations, that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,--which appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of those days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find themselves without the means of coming down,--to a set of chambers on the top floor.
<p/>'' Ah!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), mistaking me; <div class="bookquote">``the retirement reminds you of the country. So it does me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>MR. POCKET, JUN.

<p/>'' You don't want me any more?'' '' No, thank you,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``As I keep the cash,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Wemmick observed, <div class="bookquote">``we shall most likely meet pretty often.
<p/>Good day. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good day. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) thought I wanted something.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) looked at me, and said, correcting himself,-- <div class="bookquote">``To be sure! Yes. You're in the habit of shaking hands? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>I was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion, but said yes. '' I have got so out of it!'' said Mr. Wemmick,--<div class="bookquote">``except at last.
<p/>When we had shaken hands and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was gone, I opened the staircase window and had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and it came down like the guillotine.
<p/>Very glad, I'm sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>Happily it was so quick that I had not put my head out.
<p/>After this escape, I was content to take a foggy view of the Inn through the window's encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefully looking out, saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated.
<p/>Mr. Pocket, Junior's, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearly maddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had written my name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the window, before I heard footsteps on the stairs.
<p/>Gradually there arose before me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a member of society of about my own standing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had a paper-bag under each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out of breath. ''
<p/>I am extremely sorry; but I knew there was a coach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would come by that one.
<p/>Mr. Pip?'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>). '' Mr. Pocket?'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``Dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) exclaimed. '' The fact is, I have been out on your account,--not that that is any excuse,--for
<p/>I thought, coming from the country, you might like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden Market to get it good.
<p/>'' For a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my head. I acknowledged his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) attention incoherently, and began to think this was a dream.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) was fast making jam of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) fruit by wrestling with the door while the paper-bags were under his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) arms, I begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) to allow me to hold them.
<p/>'' Dear me!'' said Mr. Pocket, Junior. '' This door sticks so!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated with the door as if it were a wild beast.
<p/>It yielded so suddenly at last, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite door, and we both laughed.
<p/>But still I felt as if my eyes must start out of my head, and as if this must be a dream.
<p/>'' Pray come in,'' said Mr. Pocket, Junior. <div class="bookquote">``Allow me to lead the way. I am rather bare here, but I hope you'll be able to make out tolerably well till Monday.
<p/>My father thought you would get on more agreeably through to-morrow with me than with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and might like to take a walk about London.
<p/>As to our table, you won't find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied from our coffee-house here, and -LRB-it is only right I should add-RRB- at your expense, such being Mr. Jaggers's directions.
<p/>As to our lodging, it's not by any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my father hasn't anything to give me, and I shouldn't be willing to take it, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had.
<p/>This is our sitting-room,--just such chairs and tables and carpet and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home.
<p/>I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you. You mustn't give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors, because they come for you from the coffee-house.
<p/>This is your bedroom; the furniture's hired for the occasion, but I trust it will answer the purpose; if you should want anything, I'll go and fetch it.
<p/>This is my little bedroom; rather musty, but Barnard's is musty. The chambers are retired, and we shall be alone together, but we shan't fight, I dare say.
<p/>But dear me, I beg your pardon, you're holding the fruit all this time. Pray let me take these bags from you.
<p/>As I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) the bags, One, Two, I saw the starting appearance come into his (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) own eyes that I knew to be in mine, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Junior</b></font>) said, falling back,--
<p/>I am quite ashamed. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord</b></font>)</div>'' Lord bless me, you're the prowling boy!'' '' And you,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``are the pale young gentleman!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Chapter XXII The pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another in Barnard's Inn, until we both burst out laughing.
<p/>'' The idea of its being you!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>). '' The idea of its being you!'' said I. And then we contemplated one another afresh, and laughed again.
<p/>Well!'' said the pale young gentleman, reaching out his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hand good-humoredly, <div class="bookquote">``it's all over now, I hope, and it will be magnanimous in you if you'll forgive me for having knocked you about so.
<p/>I derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket -LRB-for Herbert was the pale young gentleman's name-RRB- still rather confounded his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) intention with his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) execution.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>'' But I made a modest reply, and we shook hands warmly. '' You hadn't come into your good fortune at that time?'' said Herbert Pocket.
<p/>'' No,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) acquiesced: <div class="bookquote">``I heard it had happened very lately. I was rather on the lookout for good fortune then.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes.

But she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) couldn't,--at all events, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) didn't.
<p/>'' I thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that. '' Bad taste,'' said Herbert, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``but a fact.
<p/>Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had sent for me on a trial visit, and if I had come out of it successfully, I suppose I should have been provided for

'' Only adopted.'' <div class="bookquote">``Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) wreak revenge on all the male sex?
<p/>What revenge?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Lord, Mr. Pip!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>). '' Don't you know?'' '' No,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``Dear me! It's quite a story, and shall be saved till dinner-time.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) was attentive until I had finished, and then burst out laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards?
<p/>And now let me take the liberty of asking you a question. How did you come there, that day? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>I didn't ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly established.
<p/>'' Mr. Jaggers is your guardian, I understand? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) went on. '' Yes.'' <div class="bookquote">``You know he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) is Miss Havisham's man of business and solicitor, and has her (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) confidence when nobody else has?
<p/>I answered with a constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mr. Jaggers in Miss Havisham's house on the very day of our combat, but never at any other time, and that I believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had no recollection of having ever seen me there.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) called on my father to propose it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>This was bringing me -LRB-I felt-RRB- towards dangerous ground. '' Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) knew about my father from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) connection with Miss Havisham.
<p/>My father is Miss Havisham's cousin; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is a bad courtier and will not propitiate her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>).
<p/>I had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, who more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean.
<p/>'' Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) that was very taking. There was something wonderfully hopeful about his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) general air, and something that at the same time whispered to me
<p/>I became imbued with the notion on that first occasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by what means.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conquered languor about him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) spirits and briskness, that did not seem indicative of natural strength.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) would never be very successful or rich. I don't know how this was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had not a handsome face, but it was better than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) figure was a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles had taken such liberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be light and young.
<p/>Whether Mr. Trabb's local work would have sat more gracefully on him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) than on me, may be a question; but I am conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) carried off his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) rather old clothes much better than I carried off my new suit.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be a bad return unsuited to our years.
<p/>I further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a country place, and knew very little of the ways of politeness, I would take it as a great kindness in him (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) would give me a hint whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) saw me at a loss or going wrong.
<p/>I therefore told him (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) my small story, and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was. ''
<p/>With pleasure,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>benefactor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``though I venture to prophesy that you'll want very few hints. I dare say we shall be often together, and I should like to banish any needless restraint between us.
<p/>Will you do me the favour to begin at once to call me by my Christian name, Herbert? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) and said I would.
<p/>I don't take to Philip,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>), smiling, <div class="bookquote">``for it sounds like a moral boy out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) fell into a pond, or so fat that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) couldn't see out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) eyes, or so avaricious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) locked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a bird's-nesting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the neighborhood.
<p/>I informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Philip</b></font>) in exchange that my Christian name was Philip. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious, and you have been a blacksmith,--would
<p/>you mind it?'' <div class="bookquote">``I shouldn't mind anything that you propose,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, <div class="bookquote">``but I don't understand you.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Would you mind Handel for a familiar name?
<p/>Then, my dear Handel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>), turning round as the door opened, <div class="bookquote">``here is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of the table, because the dinner is of your providing.
<p/>There's a charming piece of music by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I should like it very much.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' ''
<p/>It was a nice little dinner,--seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor's Feast,--and it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent circumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us.
<p/>This again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the banquet off; for while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might have said, the lap of luxury,--being entirely furnished forth from the coffee-house,--the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a comparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waiter the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor -LRB-where he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) fell over them-RRB-, the melted butter in the arm-chair, the bread on the bookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl into my bed in the next
<p/>This I would not hear of, so he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) took the top, and I faced him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>). room,--where I found much of its parsley and butter in a state of congelation when I retired for the night.
<p/>All this made the feast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my pleasure was without alloy.
<p/>We had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Herbert of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) promise to tell me about Miss Havisham.
<p/>Let me introduce the topic, Handel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth,--for fear of accidents,--and that while the fork is reserved for that use, it is not put further in than necessary.
<p/>'' True,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) replied. '' I'll redeem it at once. It is scarcely worth mentioning, only it's as well to do as other people do.
<p/>You get at your mouth better -LRB-which after all is the object-RRB-, and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening oysters, on the part of the right elbow.
<p/>Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under. This has two advantages. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we both laughed and I scarcely blushed.
<p/>'' Now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``concerning Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham, you must know, was a spoilt child. Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mother died when she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was a baby, and her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) father denied her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) nothing.
<p/>I don't know why it should be a crack thing to be a brewer; but it is indisputable that while you cannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was and brew.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) father was a country gentleman down in your part of the world, and was a brewer. You see it every day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Yet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)?'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``Not on any account,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned Herbert; <div class="bookquote">``but a public-house may keep a gentleman.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>Well! Mr. Havisham was very rich and very proud. So was his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) daughter.'' <div class="bookquote">``Miss Havisham was an only child? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I hazarded. '' Stop a moment, I am coming to that. No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was not an only child; she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had a half-brother.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) father privately married again--his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cook, I rather think.'' <div class="bookquote">``I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was proud,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``My good Handel, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) was.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was dead, I apprehend he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) first told his (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) daughter what he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) had done, and then the son became a part of the family, residing in the house you are acquainted with.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) married his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) second wife privately, because he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was proud, and in course of time she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) died. As the son grew a young man, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) turned out riotous, extravagant, undutiful,--altogether bad.
<p/>At last his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father disinherited him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) softened when he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was dying, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) well off, though not nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.--Take another glass of wine, and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to be so strictly conscientious in emptying one's glass, as to turn it bottom upwards with the rim on one's nose.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>I had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) recital. I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), and apologized. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and resumed. ''
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) half-brother had now ample means again, but what with debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again.
<p/>There were stronger differences between him (<font color='blue'><b>half-brother</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) than there had been between him (<font color='blue'><b>half-brother</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>half-brother</b></font>) father, and it is suspected that he (<font color='blue'><b>half-brother</b></font>) cherished a deep and mortal grudge against her (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) as having influenced the father's anger.
<p/>Now, I come to the cruel part of the story,--merely breaking off, my dear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a tumbler.
<p/>Miss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked after as a great match. '' Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to say.
<p/>I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a much better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it within those limits.
<p/>Again I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) and apologized, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) said in the cheerfullest manner, <div class="bookquote">``Not at all, I am sure!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and resumed.
<p/>There appeared upon the scene--say at the races, or the public balls, or anywhere else you like--a certain man, who made love to Miss Havisham.
<p/>I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) -LRB-for this happened five-and-twenty years ago, before you and I were, Handel-RRB-, but I have heard my father mention that he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) was a showy man, and the kind of man for the purpose.
<p/>But that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a gentleman, my father most strongly asseverates; because it is a principle of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever was, since the world began, a true gentleman in manner.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) says, no varnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish you put on, the more the grain will express itself.
<p/>I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not shown much susceptibility up to that time; but all the susceptibility she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) possessed certainly came out then, and she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passionately loved him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).
<p/>'' Well! This man pursued Miss Havisham closely, and professed to be devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>). There is no doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) perfectly idolized him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) practised on her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) affection in that systematic way, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got great sums of money from her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) to buy her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) brother out of a share in the brewery -LRB-which had been weakly left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father-RRB- at an immense price, on the plea that when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) husband he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must hold and manage it all.
<p/>Your guardian was not at that time in Miss Havisham's counsels, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was too haughty and too much in love to be advised by any one.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) relations were poor and scheming, with the exception of my father; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was poor enough, but not time-serving or jealous.
<p/>The only independent one among them, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) warned her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was doing too much for this man, and was placing herself too unreservedly in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) took the first opportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house, in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) presence, and my father has never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) since.
<p/>I thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) having said, <div class="bookquote">``Matthew will come and see me at last when I am laid dead upon that table;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and I asked Herbert whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) father was so inveterate against her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)?
<p/>It's not that,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) charged him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), in the presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) intended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own advancement, and, if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) were to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) now, it would look true--even to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)--and even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>).
<p/>The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were bought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests were invited.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' To return to the man and make an end of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The day came, but not the bridegroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) a letter--'' <div class="bookquote">``Which she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) received,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>I struck in, <div class="bookquote">``when she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was dressing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) marriage?

(<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``At the hour and minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, nodding, <div class="bookquote">``at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) afterwards stopped all the clocks.
<p/>What was in it, further than that it most heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can't tell you, because I don't know.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) recovered from a bad illness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) laid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) has never since looked upon the light of day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>All I know of it; and indeed I only know so much, through piecing it out for myself; for my father always avoids it, and, even when Miss Havisham invited me to go there, told me no more of it than it was absolutely requisite I should understand.
<p/>It has been supposed that the man to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) misplaced confidence acted throughout in concert with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) half-brother; that it was a conspiracy between them; and that they shared the profits.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is that all the story? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, after considering it. '' But I have forgotten one thing. <div class="bookquote">``I wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>half-brother</b></font>) didn't marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) and get all the property,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>half-brother</b></font>) may have been married already, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) cruel mortification may have been a part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) half-brother's scheme,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Herbert.
<p/>'' Mind! I don't know that.'' '' What became of the two men? '' I asked, after again considering the subject. ''
<p/>They fell into deeper shame and degradation--if there can be deeper--and ruin.'' <div class="bookquote">``Are they alive now?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>You said just now that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham, but adopted. When adopted?'' Herbert shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) shoulders. ''
<p/>And now, Handel,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>), finally throwing off the story as it were, <div class="bookquote">``there is a perfectly open understanding between us.
<p/>There has always been an Estella, since I have heard of a Miss Havisham. I know no more. All that I know about Miss Havisham, you know.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' And all that I know,'' I retorted, <div class="bookquote">``you know.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I fully believe it. So there can be no competition or perplexity between you and me.
<p/>And as to the condition on which you hold your advancement in life,--namely, that you are not to inquire or discuss to whom you owe it,--you may be very sure that it will never be encroached upon, or even approached, by me, or by any one belonging to me.
<p/>In truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subject done with, even though I should be under his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) father's roof for years and years to come.
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said it with so much meaning, too, that I felt he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, as I understood the fact myself.
<p/>It had not occurred to me before, that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had led up to the theme for the purpose of clearing it out of our way; but we were so much the lighter and easier for having broached it, that I now perceived this to be the case.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), in the course of conversation, what he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was? He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) replied, ``A capitalist,--an Insurer of Ships.
<p/>I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) saw me glancing about the room in search of some tokens of Shipping, or capital, for he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``In the City.
<p/>I had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in the City, and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insurer on his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) back, blackened his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) enterprising eye, and cut his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) responsible head open.
<p/>But again there came upon me, for my relief, that odd impression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' I shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring ships. I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and cut into the Direction.
<p/>I shall also do a little in the mining way. None of these things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own account.
<p/>I think I shall trade,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>), leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) chair, <div class="bookquote">``to the East Indies, for silks, shawls, spices, dyes, drugs, and precious woods.
<p/>It's an interesting trade.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' And the profits are large?'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``Tremendous!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>). I wavered again, and began to think here were greater expectations than my own.
<p/>I think I shall trade, also,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>), putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) thumbs in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) waist-coat pockets, <div class="bookquote">``to the West Indies, for sugar, tobacco, and rum.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Also to Ceylon, specially for elephants' tusks. '' <div class="bookquote">``You will want a good many ships,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``A perfect fleet,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>).
<p/>Quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions, I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) where the ships he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) insured mostly traded to at present?
<p/>'' I haven't begun insuring yet,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) replied. '' I am looking about me. '' Somehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard's Inn.
<p/>I said -LRB-in a tone of conviction-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``Ah-h!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. I am in a counting-house, and looking about me.'' <div class="bookquote">``Is a counting-house profitable?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. '' To--do you mean to the young fellow who's in it?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) asked, in reply. <div class="bookquote">``Yes; to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, n-no; not to me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said this with the air of one carefully reckoning up and striking a balance.
<p/>This certainly had not a profitable appearance, and I shook my head as if I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative capital from such a source of income.
<p/>'' Not directly profitable. That is, it doesn't pay me anything, and I have to--keep myself. '' '' But the thing is,'' said Herbert Pocket, <div class="bookquote">``that you look about you.
<p/>It struck me as a singular implication that you couldn't be out of a counting-house, you know, and look about you; but I silently deferred to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) experience.
<p/>That's the grand thing. You are in a counting-house, you know, and you look about you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>'' Then the time comes,'' said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``when you see your opening.
<p/>And you go in, and you swoop upon it and you make your capital, and then there you are! When you have once made your capital, you have nothing to do but employ it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>This was very like his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) way of conducting that encounter in the garden; very like. His (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) manner of bearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) poverty, too, exactly corresponded to his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) manner of bearing that defeat.
<p/>It seemed to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) took all blows and buffets now with just the same air as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had taken mine then.
<p/>It was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had nothing around him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) but the simplest necessaries, for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have been sent in on my account from the coffee-house or somewhere else.
<p/>Yet, having already made his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) fortune in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) own mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was so unassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) for not being puffed up.
<p/>In the evening we went out for a walk in the streets, and went half-price to the Theatre; and next day we went to church at Westminster Abbey, and in the afternoon we walked in the Parks; and I wondered who shod all the horses there, and wished Joe did.
<p/>It was a pleasant addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) naturally pleasant ways, and we got on famously. On a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday, since I had left Joe and Biddy.
<p/>That I could have been at our old church in my old church-going clothes, on the very last Sunday that ever was, seemed a combination of impossibilities, geographical and social, solar and lunar.
<p/>Yet in the London streets so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening, there were depressing hints of reproaches for that I had put the poor old kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead of night, the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about Barnard's Inn, under pretence of watching it, fell hollow on my heart.
<p/>On the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Herbert went to the counting-house to report himself,--to look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), too,
<p/>The space interposed between myself and them partook of that expansion, and our marshes were any distance off. I suppose,--and I bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) company.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was to come away in an hour or two to attend me to Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).
<p/>It appeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched were incubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judging from the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday morning.
<p/>Nor did the counting-house where Herbert assisted, show in my eyes as at all a good Observatory; being a back second floor up a yard, of a grimy presence in all particulars, and with a look into another back second floor, rather than a look out.
<p/>I waited about until it was noon, and I went upon `Change, and I saw fluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I took to be great merchants, though I couldn't understand why they should all be out of spirits.
<p/>When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at a celebrated house which I then quite venerated, but now believe to have been the most abject superstition in Europe, and where I could not help noticing, even then, that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives and waiters' clothes, than in the steaks.
<p/>This collation disposed of at a moderate price -LRB-considering the grease, which was not charged for-RRB-, we went back to Barnard's Inn and got my little portmanteau, and then took coach for Hammersmith.
<p/>We arrived there at two or three o'clock in the afternoon, and had very little way to walk to Mr. Pocket's house.
<p/>Lifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct into a little garden overlooking the river, where Mr. Pocket's children were playing about.
<p/>And unless I deceive myself on a point where my interests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr. and Mrs. Pocket's children were not growing up or being brought up, but were tumbling up.
<p/>Mrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket's two nurse-maids were looking about them while the children played.
<p/>'' Mamma,'' said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``this is young Mr. Pip. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me with an appearance of amiable dignity.
<p/>Master Alick and Miss Jane,'' cried one of the nurses to two of the children, ``if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you'll fall over into the river and be drownded, and what'll your pa say then?
<p/>At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket's handkerchief, and said, <div class="bookquote">``If that don't make six times you've dropped it, Mum!''
 (<font color='red'><b>this nurse</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' Upon which Mrs. Pocket laughed and said, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Flopson,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and settling herself in one chair only, resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) book.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) countenance immediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) had been reading for a week, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) could have read half a dozen lines, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) eyes upon me, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I hope your mamma is quite well?
<p/>This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I began saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such person I had no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) would have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and would have sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) compliments, when the nurse came to my rescue.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Well!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, ``if that don't make seven times! What ARE you a doing of this afternoon, Mum!
<p/>Mrs. Pocket received her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) property, at first with a look of unutterable surprise as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had never seen it before, and then with a laugh of recognition, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Flopson,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and forgot me, and went on reading.
<p/>I found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than six little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up.
<p/>'' I had scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the region of air, wailing dolefully.
<p/>Millers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by degrees the child's wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a young ventriloquist with something in its mouth.
<p/>'' If there ain't Baby! '' said Flopson, appearing to think it most surprising. <div class="bookquote">``Make haste up, Millers. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Pocket read all the time, and I was curious to know what the book could be.
<p/>We were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us; at any rate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed near Mrs. Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up and tumbled over her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>),--always very much to her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) momentary astonishment, and their own more enduring lamentation.
<p/>I was at a loss to account for this surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to speculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby, which baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs. Pocket, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby and all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.
<p/>'' Gracious me, Flopson! '' said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) book for a moment, <div class="bookquote">``everybody's tumbling!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pocket</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Gracious you, indeed, Mum!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Flopson</b></font>)</div>returned Flopson, very red in the face; <div class="bookquote">``what have you got there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Flopson</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I got here, Flopson?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Pocket. ''
<p/>Why, if it ain't your footstool!'' cried Flopson. '' And if you keep it under your skirts like that, who's to help tumbling?
<p/>Mrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a little in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mum</b></font>) lap, while the other children played about it.
<p/>This had lasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap.
<p/>Thus I made the second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the little Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.
<p/>Under these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the children into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocket came out of it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to find that Mr. Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) very gray hair disordered on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) head, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) didn't quite see his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) way to putting anything straight.
<p/>Here! Take the baby, Mum, and give me your book. '' Chapter XXIII Mr. Pocket said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) was glad to see me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) hoped I was not sorry to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) was a young-looking man, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) perplexities and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) very gray hair, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) manner seemed quite natural.
<p/>I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected; there was something comic in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) distraught way, as though it would have been downright ludicrous but for his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) own perception that it was very near being so.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had talked with me a little, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) said to Mrs. Pocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) eyebrows, which were black and handsome, <div class="bookquote">``Belinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>For, I really am not,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) added, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) son's smile, <div class="bookquote">``an alarming personage. ''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>'' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) looked up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) book, and said, ``Yes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) then smiled upon me in an absent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste of orange-flower water?
<p/>As the question had no bearing, near or remote, on any foregone or subsequent transaction, I consider it to have been thrown out, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>) previous approaches, in general conversational condescension.
<p/>I found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that Mrs. Pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased Knight, who had invented for himself a conviction that his (<font color='blue'><b>Knight</b></font>) deceased father would have been made a Baronet but for somebody's determined opposition arising out of entirely personal motives,--I forget whose, if I ever knew,--the
<p/>Sovereign's, the Prime Minister's, the Lord Chancellor's, the Archbishop of Canterbury's, anybody's,--and had tacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite supposititious fact.
<p/>I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) had been knighted himself for storming the English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperate address engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of some building or other, and for handing some Royal Personage either the trowel or the mortar.
<p/>Be that as it may, he (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) had directed Mrs. Pocket to be brought up from her (<font color='blue'><b>anybody</b></font>) cradle as one who in the nature of things must marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge.
<p/>So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady by this judicious parent, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had grown up highly ornamental, but perfectly helpless and useless.
<p/>With her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) character thus happily formed, in the first bloom of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) youth she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had encountered Mr. Pocket: who was also in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to mount to the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre.
<p/>As his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) doing the one or the other was a mere question of time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) and Mrs. Pocket had taken Time by the forelock -LRB-when, to judge from its length, it would seem to have wanted cutting-RRB-, and had married without the knowledge of the judicious parent.
<p/>The judicious parent, having nothing to bestow or withhold but his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) blessing, had handsomely settled that dower upon them after a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket that his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) wife was ``a treasure for a Prince.
<p/>Mr. Pocket had invested the Prince's treasure in the ways of the world ever since, and it was supposed to have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) in but indifferent interest.
<p/>Still, Mrs. Pocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity, because she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had not married a title; while Mr. Pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving reproach, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had never got one.
<p/>Mr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was a pleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for my own private sitting-room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) then knocked at the doors of two other similar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummle and Startop.
<p/>Startop, younger in years and appearance, was reading and holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) head, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) thought himself in danger of exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge.
<p/>Both Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody else's hands, that I wondered who really was in possession of the house and let them live there, until I found this unknown power to be the servants.
<p/>It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect of saving trouble; but it had the appearance of being expensive, for the servants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and drinking, and to keep a deal of company downstairs.
<p/>They allowed a very liberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket, yet it always appeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been the kitchen,--always supposing the boarder capable of self-defence, for, before I had been there a week, a neighboring lady with whom the family were personally unacquainted, wrote in to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had seen Millers slapping the baby.
<p/>This greatly distressed Mrs. Pocket, who burst into tears on receiving the note, and said that it was an extraordinary thing that the neighbors couldn't mind their own business.
<p/>By degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had been educated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had distinguished himself; but that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket very early in life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had impaired his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) prospects and taken up the calling of a Grinder.
<p/>After grinding a number of dull blades,--of whom it was remarkable that their fathers, when influential, were always going to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) to preferment, but always forgot to do it when the blades had left the Grindstone,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had wearied of that poor work and had come to London.
<p/>Here, after gradually failing in loftier hopes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``read''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them, and had refurbished divers others for special occasions, and had turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction, and on such means, added to some very moderate private resources, still maintained the house I saw.
<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbor; a widow lady of that highly sympathetic nature that she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) agreed with everybody, blessed everybody, and shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances.
<p/>This lady's name was Mrs. Coiler, and I had the honor of taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) down to dinner on the day of my installation.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) gave me to understand on the stairs, that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr. Pocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>).
<p/>That did not extend to me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) told me in a gush of love and confidence -LRB-at that time, I had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) something less than five minutes-RRB-; if they were all like Me, it would be quite another thing.
<p/>But dear Mrs. Pocket,'' said Mrs. Coiler, <div class="bookquote">``after her (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) early disappointment -LRB-not that dear Mr. Pocket was to blame in that-RRB-, requires so much luxury and elegance--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Coiler</b></font>)</div>'' Drummle, an old-looking young man of a heavy order of architecture, was whistling. '' '' '' Yes, ma'am,'' I said, to stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>), for I was afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) was going to cry.
<p/>'' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) is of so aristocratic a disposition-- '' '' Yes, ma'am,'' I said again, with the same object as before.
<p/>'' --That it is hard,'' said Mrs. Coiler, <div class="bookquote">``to have dear Mr. Pocket's time and attention diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket.
<p/>I could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher's time and attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket; but I said nothing, and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company manners.
<p/>It came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and Drummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and other instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Christian name was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy.
<p/>It further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the garden was all about titles, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bentley</b></font>) knew the exact date at which her (<font color='blue'><b>Bentley</b></font>) grandpapa would have come into the book, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) ever had come at all.
<p/>Drummle didn't say much, but in his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) limited way -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) struck me as a sulky kind of fellow-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) spoke as one of the elect, and recognized Mrs. Pocket as a woman and a sister.
<p/>No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler the toady neighbor showed any interest in this part of the conversation, and it appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; but it promised to last a long time, when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic affliction.
<p/>To my unutterable amazement, I now, for the first time, saw Mr. Pocket relieve his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) mind by going through a performance that struck me as very extraordinary, but which made no impression on anybody else, and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) laid down the carving-knife and fork,--being engaged in carving, at the moment,--put his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) two hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) disturbed hair, and appeared to make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had done this, and had not lifted himself up at all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) quietly went on with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) was about.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Coiler</b></font>)</div>It was, in effect, that the cook had mislaid the beef. Mrs. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) had a serpentine way of coming close at me when she (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and localities I had left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) made an occasional bounce upon Startop -LRB-who said very little to her (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>)-RRB-, or upon Drummle -LRB-who said less-RRB-, I rather envied them for being on the opposite side of the table.
<p/>After dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler made admiring comments on their eyes, noses, and legs,--a sagacious way of improving their minds.
<p/>There were four little girls, and two little boys, besides the baby who might have been either, and the baby's next successor who was as yet neither.
<p/>They were brought in by Flopson and Millers, much as though those two non-commissioned officers had been recruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these, while Mrs. Pocket looked at the young Nobles that ought to have been as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) rather thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) had had the pleasure of inspecting them before, but didn't quite know what to make of them.
<p/>I liked it for a few moments, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Coiler</b></font>) flattered me so very grossly that the pleasure was soon over. ''
<p/>Here! Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby,'' said Flopson. '' Don't take it that way, or you'll get its head under the table.
<p/>Thus advised, Mrs. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head upon the table; which was announced to all present by a prodigious concussion.
<p/>'' '' Dear, dear! Give it me back, Mum,'' said Flopson; <div class="bookquote">``and Miss Jane, come and dance to baby, do! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Flopson</b></font>)</div><p/>One of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely taken upon herself some charge of the others, stepped out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) place by me, and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying, and laughed.
<p/>Then, all the children laughed, and Mr. Pocket -LRB-who in the meantime had twice endeavored to lift himself up by the hair-RRB- laughed, and we all laughed and were glad.
<p/>Flopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll, then got it safely into Mrs. Pocket's lap, and gave it the nut-crackers to play with; at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take notice that the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its eyes, and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same.
<p/>Then, the two nurses left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with a dissipated page who had waited at dinner, and who had clearly lost half his (<font color='blue'><b>baby</b></font>) buttons at the gaming-table.
<p/>I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket's falling into a discussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) ate a sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about the baby on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) lap, who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers.
<p/>At length little Jane, perceiving its young brains to be imperilled, softly left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) place, and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous weapon away.
<p/>Mrs. Pocket finishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) orange at about the same time, and not approving of this, said to Jane,-- <div class="bookquote">``You naughty child, how dare you?
<p/>Go and sit down this instant!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Miss Jane</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mamma dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl ood</b></font>)</div>lisped the little girl, <div class="bookquote">``baby ood have put hith eyeth out. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl ood</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How dare you tell me so?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>retorted Mrs. Pocket.
<p/>Mrs. Pocket's dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed, as if I myself had done something to rouse it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go and sit down in your chair this moment!''  (<font color='red'><b>Belinda</b></font>)</div>'' Belinda,'' remonstrated Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the table, <div class="bookquote">``how can you be so unreasonable?
<p/>Jane only interfered for the protection of baby.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pocket/Matthew/Mr. Matthew Pocket</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will not allow anybody to interfere,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pocket. '' I am surprised, Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront of interference.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pocket/Matthew/Mr. Matthew Pocket</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation. <div class="bookquote">``Are infants to be nut-crackered into their tombs, and is nobody to save them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will not be interfered with by Jane,''  (<font color='red'><b>that offender</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pocket, with a majestic glance at that innocent little offender. ''
<p/>Mr. Pocket got his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) hair again, and this time really did lift himself some inches out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) chair.
<p/>I hope I know my poor grandpapa's position. Jane, indeed! '' <div class="bookquote">``Hear this!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) helplessly exclaimed to the elements. '' Babies are to be nut-crackered dead, for people's poor grandpapa's positions!
<p/>'' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) let himself down again, and became silent. We all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on.
<p/>A pause succeeded, during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a series of leaps and crows at little Jane, who appeared to me to be the only member of the family -LRB-irrespective of servants-RRB- with whom it had any decided acquaintance.
<p/>'' Mr. Drummle,'' said Mrs. Pocket, <div class="bookquote">``will you ring for Flopson? Jane, you undutiful little thing, go and lie down. Now, baby darling, come with ma!
<p/>It doubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket's arm, exhibited a pair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft face, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny.
<p/>And it gained its point after all, for I saw it through the window within a few minutes, being nursed by little Jane.
<p/>It happened that the other five children were left behind at the dinner-table, through Flopson's having some private engagement, and their not being anybody else's business.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pocket</b></font>)</div>The baby was the soul of honor, and protested with all its might. I thus became aware of the mutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket, which were exemplified in the following manner.
<p/>Mr. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) face heightened and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) couldn't make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that establishment, and why they hadn't been billeted by Nature on somebody else.
<p/>Then, in a distant Missionary way he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) asked them certain questions,--as why little Joe had that hole in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) frill, who said, Pa, Flopson was going to mend it when she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had time,--and
<p/>Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) melted into parental tenderness, and gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play; and then as they went out, with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the hair he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) dismissed the hopeless subject.
<p/>how little Fanny came by that whitlow, who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice it when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) didn't forget. In the evening there was rowing on the river.
<p/>I was pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts, but as I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames,--not to say for other waters,--I at once engaged to place myself under the tuition of the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs, and to whom I was introduced by my new allies.
<p/>As Drummle and Startop had each a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out. This practical authority confused me very much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) could have known how nearly the compliment lost him (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) pupil, I doubt if he (<font color='blue'><b>blacksmith</b></font>) would have paid it.
<p/>There was a supper-tray after we got home at night, and I think we should all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable domestic occurrence.
<p/>Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid came in, and said, <div class="bookquote">``If you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a housemaid</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Speak to your master?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pocket, whose dignity was roused again. '' How can you think of such a thing?
<p/>Go and speak to Flopson. Or speak to me--at some other time.'' <div class="bookquote">``Begging your pardon, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>the housemaid</b></font>)</div>returned the housemaid, <div class="bookquote">``I should wish to speak at once, and to speak to master.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the housemaid</b></font>)</div>Hereupon, Mr. Pocket went out of the room, and we made the best of ourselves until he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) came back. ''
<p/>Here's the cook lying insensibly drunk on the kitchen floor, with a large bundle of fresh butter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease!
<p/>This is a pretty thing, Belinda!'' said Mr. Pocket, returning with a countenance expressive of grief and despair. '' '' Mrs. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion, and said, <div class="bookquote">``This is that odious Sophia's doing!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Did I not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) with my own eyes and hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) with my own ears, come into the room just now and ask to speak to you?''
<p/>'' What do you mean, Belinda?'' demanded Mr. Pocket. '' Sophia has told you,'' said Mrs. Pocket. '' '' But has she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) not taken me downstairs, Belinda,'' returned Mr. Pocket, <div class="bookquote">``and shown me the woman, and the bundle too?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pocket/Matthew/Mr. Matthew Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And do you defend her (<font color='blue'><b>Belinda</b></font>), Matthew,'' said Mrs. Pocket, <div class="bookquote">``for making mischief? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pocket</b></font>)</div>Mr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan. ''
<p/>Besides, the cook has always been a very nice respectful woman, and said in the most natural manner when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came to look after the situation, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt I was born to be a Duchess.
<p/>Am I, grandpapa's granddaughter, to be nothing in the house?'' said Mrs. Pocket. '' '' There was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) dropped upon it in the attitude of the Dying Gladiator.
<p/>Still in that attitude he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) said, with a hollow voice, <div class="bookquote">``Good night, Mr. Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>when I deemed it advisable to go to bed and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>).
<p/>After two or three days, when I had established myself in my room and had gone backwards and forwards to London several times, and had ordered all I wanted of my tradesmen, Mr. Pocket and I had a long talk together.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) knew more of my intended career than I knew myself, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) referred to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designed for any profession, and that I should be well enough educated for my destiny if I could <div class="bookquote">``hold my own''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>with the average of young men in prosperous circumstances.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisition of such mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) with the functions of explainer and director of all my studies.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) hoped that with intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me, and should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>).
<p/>Through his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) way of saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) placed himself on confidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may state at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) was always so zealous and honorable in fulfilling his (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) compact with me, that he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) made me zealous and honorable in fulfilling mine with him (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>).
<p/>Chapter XXIV I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to the contrary. If he (<font color='blue'><b>director</b></font>) had shown indifference as a master, I have no doubt
<p/>I should have returned the compliment as a pupil; he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) gave me no such excuse, and each of us did the other justice.
<p/>Nor did I ever regard him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) as having anything ludicrous about him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>)--or anything but what was serious, honest, and good--in his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) tutor communication with me.
<p/>When these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I had begun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain my bedroom in Barnard's Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while my manners would be none the worse for Herbert's society.
<p/>Mr. Pocket did not object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could possibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian.
<p/>I felt that this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would save Herbert some expense, so I went off to Little Britain and imparted my wish to Mr. Jaggers.
<p/>If I could buy the furniture now hired for me,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``and one or two other little things, I should be quite at home there.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Go it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, with a short laugh. '' I told you you'd get on. Well! How much do you want?
<p/>'' I said I didn't know how much. <div class="bookquote">``Come! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>retorted Mr. Jaggers. '' How much? Fifty pounds?'' <div class="bookquote">``O, not nearly so much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``More than that, eh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>retorted Mr. Jaggers, lying in wait for me, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) pockets, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head on one side, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) eyes on the wall behind me; <div class="bookquote">``how much more?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Five pounds?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers. This was such a great fall, that I said in discomfiture, ``O, more than that. <div class="bookquote">``It is so difficult to fix a sum,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, hesitating.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers. '' Let's get at it. Twice five; will that do? Three times five; will that do? Four times five; will that do?
<p/>'' I said I thought that would do handsomely. '' Four times five will do handsomely, will it?'' said Mr. Jaggers, knitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) brows.
<p/>'' Now, what do you make of four times five?'' '' What do I make of it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers; <div class="bookquote">``how much?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you make it twenty pounds,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, smiling. '' Never mind what I make it, my friend,'' observed Mr. Jaggers, with a knowing and contradictory toss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head.
<p/>'' I want to know what you make it.'' '' Twenty pounds, of course.'' <div class="bookquote">``Wemmick!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) office door.
<p/>This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked impression on me, and that not of an agreeable kind.
<p/>Mr. Jaggers never laughed; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) wore great bright creaking boots, and, in poising himself on these boots, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) large head bent down and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) eyebrows joined together, awaiting an answer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) sometimes caused the boots to creak, as if they laughed in a dry and suspicious way.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) happened to go out now, and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative, I said to Wemmick that I hardly knew what to make of Mr. Jaggers's manner.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) that, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)'ll take it as a compliment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>answered Wemmick; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) don't mean that you should know what to make of it.--Oh!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>Take Mr. Pip's written order, and pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) twenty pounds. '' '' for I looked surprised, <div class="bookquote">``it's not personal; it's professional: only professional.
<p/>Wemmick was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) desk, lunching--and crunching--on a dry hard biscuit; pieces of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) threw from time to time into his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) slit of a mouth, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) were posting them.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Always seems to me,'' said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had set a man-trap and was watching it. Suddenly-click-- you're caught!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>Without remarking that man-traps were not among the amenities of life, I said I supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was very skilful? '' Deep,'' said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``as Australia.
<p/>Pointing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) pen at the office floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the purposes of the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>'' If there was anything deeper,'' added Wemmick, bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) pen to paper, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)'d be it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>Then, I said I supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had a fine business, and Wemmick said, <div class="bookquote">``Ca-pi-tal!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>Then I asked if there were many clerks? to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) replied,-- <div class="bookquote">``We don't run much into clerks, because there's only one Jaggers, and people won't have him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) at second hand.
<p/>There are only four of us. Would you like to see 'em? You are one of us, as I may say.
<p/>When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the post, and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe, the key of which safe he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) kept somewhere down his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) back and produced from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) coat-collar like an iron-pigtail, we went upstairs.
<p/>The house was dark and shabby, and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr. Jaggers's room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase for years.
<p/>In the front first floor, a clerk who looked something between a publican and a rat-catcher--a large pale, puffed, swollen man--was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby appearance, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to be treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggers's coffers.
<p/>In the room over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he (<font color='blue'><b>terrier</b></font>) was a puppy-RRB- was similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr. Wemmick presented to me as a smelter who kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) pot always boiling, and who would melt me anything
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I accepted the offer. '' Getting evidence together,'' said Mr. Wemmick, as we came out, <div class="bookquote">``for the Bailey. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>I pleased,--and who was in an excessive white-perspiration, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had been trying his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) art on himself.
<p/>In a back room, a high-shouldered man with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel, who was dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been waxed, was stooping over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work of making fair copies of the notes of the other two gentlemen, for Mr. Jaggers's own use.
<p/>This was all the establishment. When we went downstairs again, Wemmick led me into my guardian's room, and said, <div class="bookquote">``This you've seen already.''
 (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them caught my sight again, <div class="bookquote">``whose likenesses are those?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``These?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the dust off the horrible heads before bringing them down. '' These are two celebrated ones.
<p/>This chap -LRB-why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the inkstand, to get this blot upon your eyebrow, you old rascal!-RRB-
<p/>Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit. murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) master, and, considering that he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) wasn't brought up to evidence, didn't plan it badly.''
<p/>'' I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick spat upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) eyebrow and gave it a rub with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) sleeve.
<p/>``Is it like him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)? ``Like him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)? It's himself, you know. The cast was made in Newgate, directly after he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was taken down.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) then explained this affectionate apostrophe, by touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) brooch representing the lady and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, and saying, <div class="bookquote">``Had it made for me, express!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady willow</b></font>)</div><p/>You had a particular fancy for me, hadn't you, Old Artful?'' said Wemmick. <div class="bookquote">``Is the lady anybody?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned Wemmick.
<p/>No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip, except one,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wasn't of this slender lady-like sort, and you wouldn't have caught her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looking after this urn, unless there was something to drink in it.
<p/>'' Only his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) game. -LRB-You liked your bit of game, didn't you?-RRB- '' Wemmick's attention being thus directed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) brooch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) put down the cast, and polished the brooch with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief.
<p/>'' Did that other creature come to the same end? '' I asked. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) has the same look. '' ''
<p/>You're right,'' said Wemmick; <div class="bookquote">``it's the genuine look. Much as if one nostril was caught up with a horse-hair and a little fish-hook.
<p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) came to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) forged wills, this blade did, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) didn't also put the supposed testators to sleep too.
<p/>You were a gentlemanly Cove, though ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Mr. Wemmick was again apostrophizing-RRB-, ``and you said you could write Greek. Yah, Bounceable!
<p/>Before putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) late friend on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) shelf again, Wemmick touched the largest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) mourning rings and said, <div class="bookquote">``Sent out to buy it for me, only the day before.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair, the thought crossed my mind that all his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) personal jewelry was derived from like sources.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had shown no diffidence on the subject, I ventured on the liberty of asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) the question, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) stood before me, dusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hands.
<p/>What a liar you were! I never met such a liar as you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>'' '' O yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) returned, ``these are all gifts of that kind.
<p/>One brings another, you see; that's the way of it. I always take 'em. They're curiosities. And they're property. They may not be worth much, but, after all, they're property and portable.
<p/>It don't signify to you with your brilliant lookout, but as to myself, my guiding-star always is, `Get hold of portable property'.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If at any odd time when you have nothing better to do, you wouldn't mind coming over to see me at Walworth, I could offer you a bed, and I should consider it an honor.
<p/>I have not much to show you; but such two or three curiosities as I have got you might like to look over; and I am fond of a bit of garden and a summer-house.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>When I had rendered homage to this light, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) went on to say, in a friendly manner:-- '' I said I should be delighted to accept his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hospitality.
<p/>'' Thankee,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``then we'll consider that it's to come off, when convenient to you. Have you dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet.

I'll give you punch, and not bad punch.
<p/>And now I'll tell you something. When you go to dine with Mr. Jaggers, look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) housekeeper.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>'' Shall I see something very uncommon?''
<p/>'' Well,'' said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``you'll see a wild beast tamed. Not so very uncommon, you'll tell me. I reply, that depends on the original wildness of the beast, and the amount of taming.
<p/>It won't lower your opinion of Mr. Jaggers's powers. Keep your eye on it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) I would do so, with all the interest and curiosity that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) preparation awakened.
<p/>As I was taking my departure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) asked me if I would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers ``at it?
<p/>For several reasons, and not least because I didn't clearly know what Mr. Jaggers would be found to be <div class="bookquote">``at,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>I replied in the affirmative.
<p/>We dived into the City, and came up in a crowded police-court, where a blood-relation -LRB-in the murderous sense-RRB- of the deceased, with the fanciful taste in brooches, was standing at the bar, uncomfortably chewing something; while my guardian had a woman under examination or cross-examination,--I don't know which,--and was striking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and the bench, and everybody present, with awe.
<p/>If anybody, of whatsoever degree, said a word that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) didn't approve of, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) instantly required to have it ``taken down.
<p/>If anybody wouldn't make an admission, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll have it out of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and if anybody made an admission, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Now I have got you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) words, and shrank when a hair of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyebrows turned in their direction.
<p/>I couldn't make out, for he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) seemed to me to be grinding the whole place in a mill; I only know that when I stole out on tiptoe, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was not on the side of the bench; for, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was making the legs of the old gentleman who presided, quite convulsive under the table, by his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) denunciations of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) conduct as the representative of British law and justice in that chair that day.
<p/>Chapter XXV Bentley Drummle, who was so sulky a fellow that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) even took up a book as if its writer had done him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) an injury, did not take up an acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit.
<p/>Heavy in figure, movement, and comprehension,--in the sluggish complexion of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) face, and in the large, awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) mouth as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) himself lolled about in
<p/>'' '' The magistrates shivered under a single bite of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) finger. Which side he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was on a room,--he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was idle, proud, niggardly, reserved, and suspicious.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) came of rich people down in Somersetshire, who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead.
<p/>Thus, Bentley Drummle had come to Mr. Pocket when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) was a head taller than that gentleman, and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen.
<p/>Startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) ought to have been at school, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) was devotedly attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and admired her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) beyond measure.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) had a woman's delicacy of feature, and was--<div class="bookquote">``as you may see, though you never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>said Herbert to me--<div class="bookquote">``exactly like his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) mother.
<p/>It was but natural that I should take to him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) much more kindly than to Drummle, and that, even in the earliest evenings of our boating, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) and I should pull homeward abreast of one another, conversing from boat to boat, while Bentley Drummle came up in our wake alone, under the overhanging banks and among the rushes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) would always creep in-shore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature, even when the tide would have sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) fast upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) way; and I always think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) as coming after us in the dark or by the back-water, when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in mid-stream.
<p/>I presented him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) with a half-share in my boat, which was the occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) often coming down to Hammersmith; and my possession of a half-share in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) chambers often took me up to London.
<p/>I have an affection for the road yet -LRB-though it is not so pleasant a road as it was then-RRB-, formed in the impressibility of untried youth and hope.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Herbert was my intimate companion and friend. We used to walk between the two places at all hours. When I had been in Mr. Pocket's family a month or two, Mr. and Mrs. Camilla turned up.
<p/>Camilla was Mr. Pocket's sister. Georgiana, whom I had seen at Miss Havisham's on the same occasion, also turned up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) was a cousin,--an indigestive single woman, who called her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) rigidity religion, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) liver love.
<p/>These people hated me with the hatred of cupidity and disappointment. As a matter of course, they fawned upon me in my prosperity with the basest meanness.
<p/>Towards Mr. Pocket, as a grown-up infant with no notion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) own interests, they showed the complacent forbearance I had heard them express.
<p/>Mrs. Pocket they held in contempt; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily disappointed in life, because that shed a feeble reflected light upon themselves.
<p/>I soon contracted expensive habits, and began to spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should have thought almost fabulous; but through good and evil I stuck to my books.
<p/>These were the surroundings among which I settled down, and applied myself to my education. There was no other merit in this, than my having sense enough to feel my deficiencies.
<p/>I got on fast; and, with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I wanted, and clear obstructions out of my road, I must have been as great a dolt as Drummle if I had done less.
<p/>I had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would write him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) a note and propose to go home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) on a certain evening.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) replied that it would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) much pleasure, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) would expect me at the office at six o'clock.
<p/>Thither I went, and there I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), putting the key of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) safe down his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) back as the clock struck.
<p/>Between Mr. Pocket and Herbert '' Did you think of walking down to Walworth?'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>). '' Certainly,'' said I, ``if you approve.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>was Wemmick's reply, <div class="bookquote">``for I have had my legs under the desk all day, and shall be glad to stretch them.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>Now, I'll tell you what I have got for supper, Mr. Pip. I have got a stewed steak,--which is of home
<p/>I think it's tender, because the master of the shop was a Juryman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) down easy.
<p/>I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) of it when I bought the fowl, and I said, <div class="bookquote">``Pick us out a good one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep you in the box another day or two, we could easily have done it.
<p/>preparation,--and a cold roast fowl,--which is from the cook's-shop. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) said to that, <div class="bookquote">``Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>I let him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>), of course. As far as it goes, it's property and portable. You don't object to an aged parent, I hope?
<p/>I really thought he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) was still speaking of the fowl, until he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Because I have got an aged parent at my place.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' I then said what politeness required. '' So, you haven't dined with Mr. Jaggers yet? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) pursued, as we walked along.
<p/>'' Not yet. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) told me so this afternoon when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) heard you were coming. I expect you'll have an invitation to-morrow.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)'s going to ask your pals, too. Three of 'em; ain't there? '' Although I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my intimate associates, I answered, <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>)'s going to ask the whole gang,''--I hardly felt complimented by the word,--<div class="bookquote">``and whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) gives you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>)'ll give you good.
<p/>And there's another rum thing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) house,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>proceeded Wemmick, after a moment's pause, as if the remark followed on the housekeeper understood; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) never lets a door or window be fastened at night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Don't look forward to variety, but you'll have excellence. '' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) never robbed?'' '' That's it! '' returned Wemmick.
<p/>I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), a hundred times, if I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) once, say to regular cracksmen in our front office, <div class="bookquote">``You know where I live; now, no bolt is ever drawn there; why don't you do a stroke of business with me?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) says, and gives it out publicly, <div class="bookquote">``I want to see the man who'll rob me.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Lord bless you, Come;
<p/>can't I tempt you? '' Not a man of them, sir, would be bold enough to try it on, for love or money.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They dread him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so much?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Dread him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick. '' I believe you they dread him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>). Not but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)'s artful, even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) defiance of them.
<p/>No silver, sir. Britannia metal, every spoon. '' '' So they wouldn't have much,'' I observed, <div class="bookquote">``even if they-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) would have much,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, cutting me short, <div class="bookquote">``and they know it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)'d have their lives, and the lives of scores of 'em.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)'d have all he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) could get. And it's impossible to say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) couldn't get, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) mind to it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I was falling into meditation on my guardian's greatness, when Wemmick remarked:-- <div class="bookquote">``As to the absence of plate, that's only his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) natural depth, you know.
<p/>A river's its natural depth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)'s his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) natural depth. Look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) watch-chain. That's real enough. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>'' It's very massive,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``Massive?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>repeated Wemmick. '' I think so. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) watch is a gold repeater, and worth a hundred pound if it's worth a penny.
<p/>Mr. Pip, there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about that watch; there's not a man, a woman, or a child, among them, who wouldn't identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if it was red hot, if inveigled into touching it.
<p/>At first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of a more general nature, did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the road, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of Walworth.
<p/>It appeared to be a collection of back lanes, ditches, and little gardens, and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement.
<p/>Wemmick's house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of garden, and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted with guns.
<p/>I highly commended it, I think it was the smallest house I ever saw; with the queerest gothic windows -LRB-by far the greater part of them sham-RRB-, and a gothic door almost too small to get in at.
<p/>'' '' My own doing,'' said Wemmick. '' Looks pretty; don't it? '' '' That's a real flagstaff, you see,'' said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``and on Sundays I run up a real flag.
<p/>Then look here. After I have crossed this bridge, I hoist it up--so--and cut off the communication. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>The bridge was a plank, and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide and two deep.
<p/>But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hoisted it up and made it fast; smiling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) did so, with a relish and not merely mechanically.
<p/>'' At nine o'clock every night, Greenwich time,'' said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``the gun fires. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) is, you see! And when you hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) go, I think you'll say he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)'s a Stinger.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>The piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress, constructed of lattice-work. It was protected from the weather by an ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella.
<p/>it's a principle with me, if you have an idea, carry it out and keep it up,--I don't know whether that's your opinion--'' I said, decidedly.
<p/>'' Then, at the back,'' said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``out of sight, so as not to impede the idea of fortifications,--for ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>--At
<p/>; then, I knock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers; and you'll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise.
<p/>So, sir,'' said Wemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``if you can suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil of a time in point of provisions.
<p/>Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off, but which was approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long time to get at; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth.
<p/>the back, there's a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose margin the bower was raised.
<p/>This piece of water -LRB-with an island in the middle which might have been the salad for supper-RRB- was of a circular form, and he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had constructed a fountain in it, which, when you set a little mill going and took a cork out of a pipe, played to that powerful extent that it made the back of your hand quite wet.
<p/>I am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and my own gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades,'' said Wemmick, in acknowledging my compliments.
<p/>'' '' Well; it's a good thing, you know. It brushes the Newgate cobwebs away, and pleases the Aged. You wouldn't mind being at once introduced to the Aged, would you?
<p/>There we found, sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel coat: clean, cheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf.
<p/>It wouldn't put you out? '' I expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the castle. '' Well aged parent,'' said Wemmick, shaking hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) in a cordial and jocose way, <div class="bookquote">``how am you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' All right, John; all right! '' replied the old man. '' Here's Mr. Pip, aged parent,'' said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``and I wish you could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) name.
<p/>This is a fine place of my son's, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>cried the old man, while I nodded as hard as I possibly could.
<p/>Nod away at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Mr. Pip; that's what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) likes. Nod away at him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), if you please, like winking!'' '' ''
<p/>This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept together by the Nation, after my son's time, for the people's enjoyment.''
<p/>'' said Wemmick, contemplating the old man, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hard face really softened; <div class="bookquote">``there's a nod for you;''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) a tremendous one; <div class="bookquote">``there's another for you;''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) a still more tremendous one; ``you like that, don't you?
<p/>This is a pretty pleasure-ground, sir. <div class="bookquote">``You're as proud of it as Punch; ain't you, Aged? If you're not tired, Mr. Pip--though I know it's tiring to strangers--will you tip him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) one more?
<p/>We left him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) bestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch in the arbor; where Wemmick told me, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) smoked a pipe, that it had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of perfection.
<p/>You can't think how it pleases him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I tipped him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) several more, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was in great spirits. '' Is it your own, Mr. Wemmick?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``I have got hold of it, a bit at a time. It's a freehold, by George!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is it indeed?
<p/>I hope Mr. Jaggers admires it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never seen it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick. '' Never heard of it. Never seen the Aged. Never heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>).
<p/>When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and when I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me.
<p/>No; the office is one thing, and private life is another. If it's not in any way disagreeable to you, you'll oblige me by doing the same.
<p/>I don't wish it professionally spoken about. '' Of course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) request.
<p/>The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and talking, until it was almost nine o'clock. '' Getting near gun-fire,'' said Wemmick then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) pipe; ``it's the Aged's treat.
<p/>Proceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker, with expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great nightly ceremony.
<p/>Wemmick stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) watch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hand until the moment was come for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and repair to the battery.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) took it, and went out, and presently the Stinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a cottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacup in it ring.
<p/>Upon this, the Aged--who I believe would have been blown out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows--cried out exultingly, ``He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)'s fired!
<p/>and I nodded at the old gentleman until it is no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>).
<p/>They were mostly of a felonious character; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been committed, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and several manuscript confessions written under condemnation,--upon which Mr. Wemmick set particular value as being, to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) own words, <div class="bookquote">``every one of 'em Lies, sir.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>I heerd him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)!'' The interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing me his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) collection of curiosities. ''
<p/>These were agreeably dispersed among small specimens of china and glass, various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the museum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged.
<p/>They were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had been first inducted, and which served, not only as the general sitting-room but as the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepan on the hob, and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a roasting-jack.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was lowered to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) means of egress, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) withdrew for the night.
<p/>The supper was excellent; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rot insomuch that it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig might have been farther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment.
<p/>Nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond there being such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that when I lay down on my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance that pole on my forehead all night.
<p/>There was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the Aged in the day. Wemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) cleaning my boots.
<p/>After that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) fell to gardening, and I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) from my gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) in a most devoted manner.
<p/>Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and at half-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain. By degrees, Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) mouth tightened into a post-office again.
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) key from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) coat-collar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) looked as unconscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) Walworth property as if the Castle and the drawbridge and the arbor and the lake and the fountain and the Aged, had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the Stinger.
<p/>It fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an early opportunity of comparing my guardian's establishment with that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) cashier and clerk.
<p/>My guardian was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) room, washing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hands with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) called me to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), and gave me the invitation for myself and friends which Wemmick had prepared me to receive.
<p/>At last, when we got to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) place of business Chapter XXVI '' No ceremony,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) stipulated, ``and no dinner dress, and say to-morrow.
<p/>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) where we should come to -LRB-for I had no idea where he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) lived-RRB-, and I believe it was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) general objection to make anything like an admission, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``Come here, and
<p/>I embrace this opportunity of remarking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) washed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) clients off, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) were a surgeon or a dentist.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had a closet in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) room, fitted up for the purpose, which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer's shop.
<p/>It had an unusually large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) would wash his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) room.
<p/>When I and my friends repaired to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) at six o'clock next day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) seemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual, for we found him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) head butted into this closet, not only washing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hands, but laving his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) face and gargling his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) throat.
<p/>And even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) penknife and scraped the case out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) nails before he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) coat on.
<p/>There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into the street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>); but there was something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) presence, that they gave it up for that day.
<p/>As we walked along westward, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was recognized ever and again by some face in the crowd of the streets, and whenever that happened he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) talked louder to me; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) never otherwise recognized anybody, or took notice that anybody recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I'll take you home with me. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south side of that street.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) key and opened the door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and little used.
<p/>Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in want of painting, and with dirty windows. So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on the first floor.
<p/>There were carved garlands on the panelled walls, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) stood among them giving us welcome, I know what kind of loops I thought they looked like.
<p/>Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) dressing-room; the third, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) bedroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) told us that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) held the whole house, but rarely used more of it than we saw.
<p/>The table was comfortably laid--no silver in the service, of course--and at the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) chair was a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and decanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert.
<p/>There was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books, that they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography, trials, acts of Parliament, and such things.
<p/>I noticed throughout, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) kept everything under his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) own hand, and distributed everything himself. The furniture was all very solid and good, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) watch-chain.
<p/>In a corner was a little table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) seemed to bring the office home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an evening and fall to work.
<p/>It had an official look, however, and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had scarcely seen my three companions until now,--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) and I had walked
<p/>together,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell, and took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) seemed at once to be principally if not solely interested in Drummle. ''
<p/>Pip,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) large hand on my shoulder and moving me to the window, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know one from the other.
<p/>Who's the Spider?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The spider?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>'' That's Bentley Drummle,'' I replied; <div class="bookquote">``the one with the delicate face is Startop.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Not making the least account of <div class="bookquote">``the one with the delicate face,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``Bentley Drummle is his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) name, is it?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) replying in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to screw discourse out of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).
<p/>I was looking at the two, when there came between me and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.
<p/>I like the look of that fellow. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was a woman of about forty, I supposed,--but I may have thought her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) younger than she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was.
<p/>I cannot say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) lips to be parted as if she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) were panting, and her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) face to bear a curious expression of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see Macbeth at the theatre, a night or two before, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) face looked to me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had seen rise out of the Witches' caldron.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a finger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished.
<p/>We took our seats at the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>), while Startop sat on the other.
<p/>It was a noble dish of fish that the housekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice mutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird.
<p/>Sauces, wines, all the accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our host from his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) always put them back again.
<p/>Similarly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) dealt us clean plates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just disused into two baskets on the ground by his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) chair.
<p/>Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely pale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. No other attendant than the housekeeper appeared.
<p/>Years afterwards, I made a dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.
<p/>Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) own striking appearance and by Wemmick's preparation, I observed that whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was in the room she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) eyes attentively on my guardian, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) would remove her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) hands from any dish she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) put before him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), hesitatingly, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) dreaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) calling her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) back, and wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) to speak when she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was nigh, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had anything to say.
<p/>I fancied that I could detect in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) manner a consciousness of this, and a purpose of always holding her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) in suspense.
<p/>Dinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow rather than originate subjects, I knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) wrenched the weakest part of our dispositions out of us.
<p/>For myself, I found that I was expressing my tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronize Herbert, and to boast of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my lips.
<p/>It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious way at the rest, was screwed out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) before the fish was taken off.
<p/>It was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our conversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>).
<p/>Drummle upon this, informed our host that he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) much preferred our room to our company, and that as to skill he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) was more than our master, and that as to strength he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) could scatter us like chaff.
<p/>By some invisible agency, my guardian wound him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this trifle; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) fell to baring and spanning his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) arm to show how muscular it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous manner.
<p/>Now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian, taking no heed of her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), but with the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) face turned from her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), was leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) chair biting the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) forefinger and showing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) set on every dish; and I always saw in her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) face, a face rising out of the caldron. Suddenly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) large hand on the housekeeper's, like a trap, as she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) stretched it across the table.
<p/>So suddenly and smartly did he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) do this, that we all stopped in our foolish contention. '' If you talk of strength,'' said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``I'll show you a wrist.
<p/>Molly, let them see your wrist. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) entrapped hand was on the table, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) had already put her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) other hand behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) waist.
<p/>'' Master,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) said, in a low voice, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>). '' Don't. '' <div class="bookquote">``I'll show you a wrist,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovable determination to show it.
<p/>Molly,'' said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), but obstinately looking at the opposite side of the room, <div class="bookquote">``let them see both your wrists.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Molly, let them see your wrist.'' <div class="bookquote">``Master,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) again murmured. <div class="bookquote">``Please!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Show them. Come!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) other hand from behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and held the two out side by side. The last wrist was much disfigured,--deeply scarred and scarred across and across.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hands out she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) eyes from Mr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us in succession.
<p/>'' There's power here,'' said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) forefinger. '' Very few men have the power of wrist that this woman has.
<p/>I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw stronger in that respect, man's or woman's, than these.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said these words in a leisurely, critical style, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) continued to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat.
<p/>It's remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these hands. '' The moment he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ceased, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands and went out of the room, and Mr. Jaggers, putting the decanters on from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) dumb-waiter, filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) glass and passed round the wine.
<p/>'' That'll do, Molly,'' said Mr. Jaggers, giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) a slight nod; <div class="bookquote">``you have been admired, and can go. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>At half-past nine, gentlemen,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we must break up. Pray make the best use of your time. I am glad to see you all.
<p/>Mr. Drummle, I drink to you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>If his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) object in singling out Drummle were to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) out still more, it perfectly succeeded.
<p/>In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) morose depreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) became downright intolerable.
<p/>Through all his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) stages, Mr. Jaggers followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) with the same strange interest. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) actually seemed to serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers's wine.
<p/>In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink, and I know we talked too much.
<p/>We became particularly hot upon some boorish sneer of Drummle's, to the effect that we were too free with our money.
<p/>It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that it came with a bad grace from him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), to whom Startop had lent money in my presence but a week or so before.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mean to imply that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, ``but it might make you hold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I went on, meaning to be very severe, <div class="bookquote">``that you wouldn't lend money to any of us if we wanted it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well,'' retorted Drummle; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>)'ll be paid. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Mr. Drummle</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``You should think!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>retorted Drummle. '' Oh Lord!'' <div class="bookquote">``You are right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Mr. Drummle</b></font>)</div>said Drummle.
<p/>'' I wouldn't lend one of you a sixpence. I wouldn't lend anybody a sixpence.'' '' Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.
<p/>This was so very aggravating--the more especially as I found myself making no way against his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) surly obtuseness--that I said, disregarding Herbert's efforts to check me,--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I'll tell you what passed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You should say,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated Drummle. '' Oh Lord! '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Mr. Drummle</b></font>)</div>growled Drummle.
<p/>And I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) added in a lower growl, that we might both go to the devil and shake ourselves. ''
<p/>We said that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed to be immensely amused at his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) being so weak as to lend it.
<p/>Drummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) pockets and his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) round shoulders raised; plainly signifying that it was quite true, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) despised us as asses all.
<p/>Hereupon Startop took him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) in hand, though with a much better grace than I had shown, and exhorted him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) to be a little more agreeable.
<p/>Startop, being a lively, bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact opposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) as a direct personal affront.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startop tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made us all laugh.
<p/>Resenting this little success more than anything, Drummle, without any threat or warning, pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) hands out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) pockets, dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and would have flung it at his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) adversary's head, but for our entertainer's dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that purpose.
<p/>Gentlemen,'' said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and hauling out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) gold repeater by its massive chain, <div class="bookquote">``I am exceedingly sorry to announce that it's half past nine.
<p/>I'll tell you, however,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``whether you want to know or not. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' On this hint we all rose to depart.
<p/>But the old boy was so far from responding, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would not even walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so Herbert and I, who remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides; Startop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the houses, much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was wont to follow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) boat.
<p/>As the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert there for a moment, and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian.
<p/>I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) dressing-room surrounded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) stock of boots, already hard at it, washing his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) hands of us.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything disagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) would not blame me much.
<p/>Before we got to the street door, Startop was cheerily calling Drummle <div class="bookquote">``old boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Mr. Drummle</b></font>)</div>as if nothing had happened. <div class="bookquote">``Pooh! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>), sluicing his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) face, and speaking through the water-drops; <div class="bookquote">``it's nothing, Pip.
<p/>I like that Spider though. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) had turned towards me now, and was shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) head, and blowing, and towelling himself.
<p/>'' I am glad you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>), sir,'' said I--<div class="bookquote">``but I don't. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' No, no,'' my guardian assented; <div class="bookquote">``don't have too much to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>).
<p/>Keep as clear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) as you can. But I like the fellow, Pip; he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) is one of the true sort.
<p/>But I am not a fortune-teller,''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) said, letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) head drop into a festoon of towel, and towelling away at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) two ears.
<p/>Why, if I was a fortune-teller--'' Looking out of the towel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) caught my eye. '' '' You know what I am, don't you?

<p/>I have read him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) all, excepting only the last little sentence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wishes me most particular to write again what larks.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) says you will understand. '' I received this letter by the post on Monday morning, and therefore its appointment was for next day.
<p/>Not with pleasure, though I was bound to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) by so many ties; no; with considerable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense of incongruity.
<p/>Let me confess exactly with what feelings I looked forward to Joe's coming. If I could have kept him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) away by paying money, I certainly would have paid money.
<p/>My greatest reassurance was that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was coming to Barnard's Inn, not to Hammersmith, and consequently would not fall in Bentley Drummle's way.
<p/>I had little objection to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) being seen by Herbert or his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) father, for both of whom I had a respect; but I had the sharpest sensitiveness as to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) being seen by Drummle, whom I held in contempt.
<p/>So, throughout life, our worst weaknesses and meannesses are usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.
<p/>I had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite unnecessary and inappropriate way or other, and very expensive those wrestles with Barnard proved to be.
<p/>By this time, the rooms were vastly different from what I had found them, and I enjoyed the honor of occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighboring upholsterer.
<p/>I had got on so fast of late, that I had even started a boy in boots,--top boots,--in bondage and slavery to whom I might have been said to pass my days.
<p/>For, after I had made the monster -LRB-out of the refuse of my washerwoman's family-RRB-, and had clothed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with a blue coat, canary waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the boots already mentioned, I had to find him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a little to do and a great deal to eat; and with both of those horrible requirements he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) haunted my existence.
<p/>This avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesday morning in the hall, -LRB-it was two feet square, as charged for floorcloth,-RRB- and Herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) thought Joe would like.
<p/>While I felt sincerely obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) for being so interested and considerate, I had an odd half-provoked sense of suspicion upon me, that if Joe had been coming to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) wouldn't have been quite so brisk about it.
<p/>However, I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe, and I got up early in the morning, and caused the sitting-room and breakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance.
<p/>Unfortunately the morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have concealed the fact that Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window, like some weak giant of a Sweep.
<p/>As the time approached I should have liked to run away, but the Avenger pursuant to orders was in the hall, and presently I heard Joe on the staircase.
<p/>I knew it was Joe, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) clumsy manner of coming upstairs, --his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) state boots being always too big for him (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>),--and by the time it took him (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) to read the names on the other floors in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) ascent.
<p/>When at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) stopped outside our door, I could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) finger tracing over the painted letters of my name, and I afterwards distinctly heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) breathing in at the keyhole.
<p/>I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) never would have done wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) feet, and that I must have gone out to lift him (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) off the mat, but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) came in.
<p/>Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) gave a faint single rap, and Pepper--such was the compromising name of the avenging boy--announced <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Gargery! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>'' With his (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) good honest face all glowing and shining, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) hat put down on the floor between us, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) caught both my hands and worked them straight up and down, as if I had been the last-patented Pump.
<p/>Joe, how are you, Joe?'' <div class="bookquote">``Pip, how AIR you, Pip? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am glad to see you, Joe. Give me your hat.
<p/>But Joe, taking it up carefully with both hands, like a bird's-nest with eggs in it, wouldn't hear of parting with that piece of property, and persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way.
<p/>'' Joe considered a little before he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) discovered this word; <div class="bookquote">``as to be sure you are a honor to your king and country.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' Which you have that growed,'' said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``and that swelled, and that gentle-folked; ''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>And you, Joe, look wonderfully well.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``I'm ekerval to most. And your sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'s no worse than she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) were. And Biddy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)'s ever right and ready.
<p/>All this time -LRB-still with both hands taking great care of the bird's-nest-RRB-, Joe was rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes round and round the room, and round and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown.
<p/>And all friends is no backerder, if not no forarder. ' Ceptin Wopsle; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s had a drop. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>'' Had a drop, Joe?''
<p/>'' Why yes,'' said Joe, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s left the Church and went into the playacting. Which the playacting have likeways brought him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to London along with me.
<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wish were,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, getting the bird's-nest under his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) left arm for the moment, and groping in it for an egg with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) right; ``if no offence, as I would `and you that.
<p/>I took what Joe gave me, and found it to be the crumpled play-bill of a small metropolitan theatre, announcing the first appearance, in that very week, of <div class="bookquote">``the celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian renown, whose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our National Bard has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic circles.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Were you at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bard</b></font>) performance, Joe? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired. '' I were,'' said Joe, with emphasis and solemnity. '' Was there a great sensation?''
<p/>Though I put it to yourself, sir, whether it were calc`lated to keep a man up to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work with a good hart, to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and the Ghost with <div class="bookquote">``Amen!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Ghost</b></font>)</div><p/>A man may have had a misfortun' and been in the Church,'' said Joe, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice to an argumentative and feeling tone, ``but that is no reason why you should put him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out at such a time.
<p/>Which I meantersay, if the ghost of a man's own father cannot be allowed to claim his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) attention, what can, Sir?
<p/>Still more, when his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mourning `at is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers brings it off, try to keep it on how you may.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``yes, there certainly were a peck of orange-peel. Partickler when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) see the ghost. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>A ghost-seeing effect in Joe's own countenance informed me that Herbert had entered the room.
<p/>So, I presented Joe to Herbert, who held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) hand; but Joe backed from it, and held on by the bird's-nest.
<p/>Your servant, Sir,'' said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``which I hope as you and Pip'' (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>--here his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) eye fell on the Avenger, who was putting some toast on table, and so plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the family, that I frowned it down and confused him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) more--<div class="bookquote">``I meantersay, you two gentlemen,--which
<p/>For the present may be a werry good inn, according to London opinions,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Joe, confidentially, <div class="bookquote">``and I believe its character do stand it; but I wouldn't keep a pig in it
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>I hope as you get your elths in this close spot? myself,--not in the case that I wished him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) to fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavor on him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).
<p/>Having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our dwelling-place, and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me <div class="bookquote">``sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Joe, being invited to sit down to table, looked all round the room for a suitable spot on which to deposit his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) hat,--as if it were only on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a resting place,--and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the chimney-piece, from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals.
<p/>'' '' Do you take tea, or coffee, Mr. Gargery? '' asked Herbert, who always presided of a morning. '' Thankee, Sir,'' said Joe, stiff from head to foot, ``I'll take whichever is most agreeable to yourself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thankee, Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal, <div class="bookquote">``since you are so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not run contrairy to your own opinions.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>'' What do you say to coffee?'' But don't you never find it a little `eating?'' <div class="bookquote">``Say tea then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, pouring it out.
<p/>Here Joe's hat tumbled off the mantel-piece, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) started out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) chair and picked it up, and fitted it to the same exact spot.
<p/>As if it were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again soon. '' When did you come to town, Mr. Gargery?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Were it yesterday afternoon?''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, after coughing behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) hand, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) had had time to catch the whooping-cough since he (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) came.
<p/>'' No it were not. Yes it were. Yes. It were yesterday afternoon'' -LRB-with an appearance of mingled wisdom, relief, and strict impartiality-RRB-.
<p/>'' Have you seen anything of London yet?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, yes, Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``me and Wopsle went off straight to look at the Blacking Ware'us.
<p/>But we didn't find that it come up to its likeness in the red bills at the shop doors; which I meantersay,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>added Joe, in an explanatory manner, <div class="bookquote">``as it is there drawd too architectooralooral.
<p/>I really believe Joe would have prolonged this word -LRB-mightily expressive to my mind of some architecture that I know-RRB- into a perfect Chorus, but for his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) attention being providentially attracted by his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) hat, which was toppling.
<p/>Indeed, it demanded from him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) a constant attention, and a quickness of eye and hand, very like that exacted by wicket-keeping.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) made extraordinary play with it, and showed the greatest skill; now, rushing at it and catching it neatly as it dropped; now, merely stopping it midway, beating it up, and humoring it in various parts of the room and against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on the wall, before he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) felt it safe to close with it; finally splashing it into the slop-basin, where I took the liberty of laying hands upon it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>As to his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) shirt-collar, and his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) coat-collar, they were perplexing to reflect upon,--insoluble mysteries both. Why should a man scrape himself to that extent, before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could consider himself full dressed?
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell into such unaccountable fits of meditation, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fork midway between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plate and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth; had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes attracted in such strange directions; was afflicted with such remarkable coughs; sat so far from the table, and dropped so much more than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ate, and pretended that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hadn't dropped it; that I was heartily glad when Herbert left us for the City.
<p/>I had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was all my fault, and that if I had been easier with Joe, Joe would have been easier with me.
<p/>I felt impatient of him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) and out of temper with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>); in which condition he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) heaped coals of fire on my head.
<p/>Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) holiday clothes? '' Us two being now alone, sir,''--began Joe.
<p/>'' Joe,'' I interrupted, pettishly, <div class="bookquote">``how can you call me, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Joe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like reproach.
<p/>Utterly preposterous as his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) cravat was, and as his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) collars were, I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look.
<p/>Us two being now alone,'' resumed Joe, <div class="bookquote">``and me having the intentions and abilities to stay not many minutes more, I will now conclude--leastways begin--to mention what have led to my having had the present honor.
<p/>For was it not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) old air of lucid exposition, <div class="bookquote">``that my only wish were to be useful to you, I should not have had the honor of breaking wittles in the company and abode of gentlemen.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>'' I was so unwilling to see the look again, that I made no remonstrance against this tone. '' Well, sir,'' pursued Joe, <div class="bookquote">``this is how it were.
<p/>I were at the Bargemen t`other night, Pip;'' (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>--whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) subsided into affection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) called me Pip, and whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) relapsed into politeness he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) called me sir; <div class="bookquote">``when there come up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) shay-cart, Pumblechook.
<p/>Which that same identical,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said Joe, going down a new track, <div class="bookquote">``do comb my `air the wrong way sometimes, awful, by giving out up and down town as it were him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) which ever had your infant companionation and were looked upon as a playfellow by yourself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense. It was you, Joe.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Which I fully believed it were, Pip,'' said Joe, slightly tossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``though it signify little now, sir.
<p/>a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to the workingman, sir, and do not over stimilate-RRB-, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) word were, `Joseph, Miss Havisham she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wish to speak to you.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, Pip; this same identical, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) manners is given to blusterous, come to me at the Bargemen -LRB-wot <div class="bookquote">``Miss Havisham, Joe?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>''`She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wish,' were Pumblechook's word, `to speak to you.' '' Joe sat and rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) eyes at the ceiling. '' Yes, Joe?
<p/>Go on, please.'' '' Next day, sir,'' said Joe, looking at me as if I were a long way off, <div class="bookquote">``having cleaned myself, I go and I see Miss A.
<p/>Which I say, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>replied Joe, with an air of legal formality, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) were making his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) will, <div class="bookquote">``Miss A., or otherways Havisham.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Miss A., Joe? Miss Havisham? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) expression air then as follering: `Mr. Gargery. You air in correspondence with Mr. Pip?'
<p/>-LRB-When I married your sister, sir, I said 'I will;' and when I answered your friend, Pip, I said 'I am.'-RRB- `Would you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), then,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), `that which Estella has come home and would be glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>).'
<p/>Having had a letter from you, I were able to say 'I am.' '' I felt my face fire up as I looked at Joe.
<p/>I hope one remote cause of its firing may have been my consciousness that if I had known his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) errand, I should have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) more encouragement.
<p/>Biddy,'' pursued Joe, <div class="bookquote">``when I got home and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) fur to write the message to you, a little hung back.
<p/>Biddy says, 'I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) will be very glad to have it by word of mouth, it is holiday time, you want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), go!'
<p/>I have now concluded, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) chair, <div class="bookquote">``and, Pip, I wish you ever well and ever prospering to a greater and a greater height.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' But you are not going now, Joe?'' '' Yes I am,'' said Joe. '' But you are coming back to dinner, Joe?''
<p/>'' No I am not,'' said Joe. Our eyes met, and all the <div class="bookquote">``Sir''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>melted out of that manly heart as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) gave me his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) hand. ''
<p/>Pip, dear old chap, life is made of ever so many partings welded together, as I may say, and one man's a blacksmith, and one's a whitesmith, and one's a goldsmith, and one's a coppersmith.
<p/>Diwisions among such must come, and must be met as they come. If there's been any fault at all to-day, it's mine.
<p/>You and me is not two figures to be together in London; nor yet anywheres else but what is private, and beknown, and understood among friends.
<p/>It ain't that I am proud, but that I want to be right, as you shall never see me no more in these clothes.
<p/>You won't find half so much fault in me if you think of me in my forge dress, with my hammer in my hand, or even my pipe.
<p/>You won't find half so much fault in me if, supposing as you should ever wish to see me, you come and put your head in at the forge window and see Joe the blacksmith, there, at the old anvil, in the old burnt apron, sticking to the old work.
<p/>I'm wrong in these clothes. I'm wrong out of the forge, the kitchen, or off th' meshes. I'm awful dull, but I hope I've beat out something nigh the rights of this at last.
<p/>And so GOD bless you, dear old Pip, old chap , GOD bless you! '' I had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity in him (<font color='blue'><b>GOD</b></font>).
<p/>The fashion of his (<font color='blue'><b>GOD</b></font>) dress could no more come in its way when he (<font color='blue'><b>GOD</b></font>) spoke these words than it could come in its way in Heaven.
<p/>As soon as I could recover myself sufficiently, I hurried out after him (<font color='blue'><b>GOD</b></font>) and looked for him (<font color='blue'><b>GOD</b></font>) in the neighboring streets; but he (<font color='blue'><b>GOD</b></font>) was gone.
<p/>Chapter XXVIII It was clear that I must repair to our town next day, and in the first flow of my repentance, it was equally clear that I must stay at Joe's.
<p/>But, when I had secured my box-place by to-morrow's coach, and had been down to Mr. Pocket's and back, I was not by any means convinced on the last point, and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting up at the Blue Boar.
<p/>I should be an inconvenience at Joe's; I was not expected, and my bed would not be ready; I should be too far from Miss Havisham's, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was exacting and mightn't like it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) touched me gently on the forehead, and went out. All other swindlers upon earth are nothing to the self-swindlers, and with such pretences did I cheat myself.
<p/>That I should innocently take a bad half-crown of somebody else's manufacture is reasonable enough; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin of my own make as good money!
<p/>An obliging stranger, under pretence of compactly folding up my bank-notes for security's sake, abstracts the notes and gives me nutshells; but what is his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) sleight of hand to mine, when I fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes!
<p/>Having settled that I must go to the Blue Boar, my mind was much disturbed by indecision whether or not to take the Avenger.
<p/>It was tempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) boots in the archway of the Blue Boar's posting-yard; it was almost solemn to imagine him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) casually produced in the tailor's shop, and confounding the disrespectful senses of Trabb's boy.
<p/>On the other hand, Trabb's boy might worm himself into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) intimacy and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) things; or, reckless and desperate wretch as I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could be, might hoot him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in the High Street.
<p/>Surely a curious thing. My patroness, too, might hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and not approve. On the whole, I resolved to leave the Avenger behind.
<p/>It was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, as winter had now come round, I should not arrive at my destination until two or three hours after dark.
<p/>Our time of starting from the Cross Keys was two o'clock. I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare, attended by the Avenger,--if
<p/>I may connect that expression with one who never attended on me if he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) could possibly help it. At that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock-yards by stage-coach.
<p/>As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside passengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling their ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprised when Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there were two convicts going down with me.
<p/>But I had a reason that was an old reason now for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word <div class="bookquote">``convict. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mind them, Handel?''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert. '' O no!'' <div class="bookquote">``I thought you seemed as if you didn't like them?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't pretend that I do like them, and I suppose you don't particularly.
<p/>But I don't mind them.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``See! There they are,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``coming out of the Tap. What a degraded and vile sight it is!
<p/>They had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaoler with them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>The two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their legs,--irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore the dress that I likewise knew well.
<p/>Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried a thick-knobbed bludgeon under his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) arm; but he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) was on terms of good understanding with them, and stood with them beside him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>), looking on at the putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convicts were an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) the Curator.
<p/>One was a taller and stouter man than the other, and appeared as a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of the world, both convict and free, to have had allotted to him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) the smaller suit of clothes.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes, and his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) attire disguised him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) absurdly; but I knew his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) half-closed eye at one glance.
<p/>There stood the man whom I had seen on the settle at the Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had brought me down with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) invisible gun!
<p/>It was easy to make sure that as yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) knew me no more than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) had never seen me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) looked across at me, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) eye appraised my watch-chain, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) incidentally spat and said something to the other convict, and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink of their coupling manacle, and looked at something else.
<p/>The great numbers on their backs, as if they were street doors; their coarse mangy ungainly outer surface, as if they were lower animals; their ironed legs, apologetically garlanded with pocket-handkerchiefs; and the way in which all present looked at them and kept from them; made them -LRB-as Herbert had said-RRB- a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle.
<p/>It came out that the whole of the back of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and that there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front behind the coachman.
<p/>Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had taken the fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion, and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) up with such villainous company, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, and infamous, and shameful, and I don't know what else.
<p/>At this time the coach was ready and the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing to get up, and the prisoners had come over with their keeper,--bringing with them that curious flavor of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and hearthstone, which attends the convict presence.
<p/>But this was not the worst of it. '' Don't take it so much amiss, sir,'' pleaded the keeper to the angry passenger; <div class="bookquote">``I'll sit next you myself.
<p/>I'll put 'em on the outside of the row. They won't interfere with you, sir. You needn't know they're there.''  (<font color='red'><b>the passenger</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>And don't blame me,'' growled the convict I had recognized. '' I don't want to go. I am quite ready to stay behind.
<p/>As fur as I am concerned any one's welcome to my place. '' <div class="bookquote">``Or mine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said the other, gruffly. '' I wouldn't have incommoded none of you, if I'd had my way.
<p/>'' Then they both laughed, and began cracking nuts, and spitting the shells about.--As I really think I should have liked to do myself, if I had been in their place and so despised.
<p/>At length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) must either go in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chance company or remain behind.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) got into his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) place, still making complaints, and the keeper got into the place next him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>), and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they could, and the convict I had recognized sat behind me with his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) breath on the hair of my head.
<p/>'' Good-bye, Handel!'' Herbert called out as we started. I thought what a blessed fortune it was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had found another name for me than Pip.
<p/>It is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict's breathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine.
<p/>The sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and searching acid, it set my very teeth on edge.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) seemed to have more breathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise in doing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side, in my shrinking endeavors to fend him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) off.
<p/>It made us all lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Half-way House behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent.
<p/>I dozed off, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore a couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and how it could best be done.
<p/>In the act of dipping forward as if I were going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took the question up again.
<p/>But I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although I could recognize nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and shadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that blew at us.
<p/>Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against the wind, the convicts were closer to me than before.
<p/>The very first words I heard them interchange as I became conscious, were the words of my own thought, <div class="bookquote">``Two One Pound notes.
<p/>The weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How did he (<font color='blue'><b>convicts</b></font>) get 'em?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said the convict I had never seen.
<p/>'' How should I know? '' returned the other. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>convicts</b></font>) had 'em stowed away somehows. Giv him (<font color='blue'><b>convicts</b></font>) by friends, I expect.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, <div class="bookquote">``that I had 'em here. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Two one pound notes, or friends?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Two one pound notes. I'd sell all the friends I ever had for one, and think it a blessed good bargain.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>convicts</b></font>) says,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>resumed the convict I had recognized,--<div class="bookquote">``it was all said and done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the Dock-yard,--`You're
<p/>Would I find out that boy that had fed him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and kep his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) secret, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) them two one pound notes?
<p/>Well? So he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) says--? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' a going to be discharged?' Yes, I was. Yes, I would. And I did.'' ''
<p/>More fool you,'' growled the other. '' I'd have spent 'em on a Man, in wittles and drink. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) must have been a green one.
<p/>Mean to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) knowed nothing of you?'' <div class="bookquote">``Not a ha`porth. Different gangs and different ships. He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) was tried again for prison breaking, and got made a Lifer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And was that--Honor!--the only time you worked out, in this part of the country?'' '' The only time. '' <div class="bookquote">``What might have been your opinion of the place?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp, mist, and mudbank. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually growled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.
<p/>After overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity.
<p/>Indeed, I was not only so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed and so differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could have known me without accidental help.
<p/>Still, the coincidence of our being together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with a dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, in his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) hearing, with my name.
<p/>For this reason, I resolved to alight as soon as we touched the town, and put myself out of his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) hearing.
<p/>My little portmanteau was in the boot under my feet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out; I threw it down before me, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on the first stones of the town pavement.
<p/>As to the convicts, they went their way with the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited off to the river.
<p/>In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for them at the slime-washed stairs,--again heard the gruff <div class="bookquote">``Give way, you!
<p/>This device I executed successfully. ''  (<font color='red'><b>crew</b></font>)</div>like and order to dogs,--again saw the wicked Noah's Ark lying out on the black water.
<p/>I could not have said what I was afraid of, for my fear was altogether undefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me.
<p/>As I walked on to the hotel, I felt that a dread, much exceeding the mere apprehension of a painful or disagreeable recognition, made me tremble.
<p/>I am confident that it took no distinctness of shape, and that it was the revival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood.
<p/>The coffee-room at the Blue Boar was empty, and I had not only ordered my dinner there, but had sat down to it, before the waiter knew me.
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) had apologized for the remissness of his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) memory, he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) asked me if he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) should send Boots for Mr. Pumblechook?
<p/>The waiter -LRB-it was he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) who had brought up the Great Remonstrance from the Commercials, on the day when I was bound-RRB- appeared surprised, and took the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local newspaper so directly in my way, that I took it up and read this paragraph:-- Our readers will learn, not altogether without interest, in reference to the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of this neighborhood -LRB-what a theme, by the way, for the magic pen of our as yet not universally acknowledged townsman TOOBY, the poet of our columns!-RRB- that the youth's earliest patron, companion, and friend, was a highly respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed trade, and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises are situate within a hundred miles of the High Street.
<p/>It is not wholly irrespective of our personal feelings that we record HIM as the Mentor of our young Telemachus, for it is good to know that our town produced the founder of the latter's fortunes.
<p/>'' No,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``certainly not. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Does the thought-contracted brow of the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local Beauty inquire whose fortunes?
<p/>I entertain a conviction, based upon large experience, that if in the days of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole, I should have met somebody there, wandering Esquimaux or civilized man, who would have told me that Pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my fortunes.
<p/>We believe that Quintin Matsys was the BLACKSMITH of Antwerp. VERB. SAP. Chapter XXIX Betimes in the morning I was up and out.
<p/>It was too early yet to go to Miss Havisham's, so I loitered into the country on Miss Havisham's side of town,--which
<p/>was not Joe's side; I could go there to-morrow,--thinking about my patroness, and painting brilliant pictures of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) plans for me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had adopted Estella, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had as good as adopted me, and it could not fail to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) intention to bring us together.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) reserved it for me to restore the desolate house, admit the sunshine into the dark rooms, set the clocks a-going and the cold hearths
<p/>a-blazing, tear down the cobwebs, destroy the vermin,--in short, do all the shining deeds of the young Knight of romance, and marry the Princess.
<p/>I had stopped to look at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick walls, blocked windows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with its twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a rich attractive mystery, of which I was the hero.
<p/>But, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) had taken such strong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were so set upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>), though her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) influence on my boyish life and character had been all-powerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest her (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) with any attributes save those she (<font color='blue'><b>Princess</b></font>) possessed.
<p/>I mention this in this place, of a fixed purpose, because it is the clew by which I am to be followed into my poor labyrinth.
<p/>Estella was the inspiration of it, and the heart of it, of course. According to my experience, the conventional notion of a lover cannot be always true.
<p/>The unqualified truth is, that when I loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) simply because I found her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) irresistible.
<p/>Once for all; I knew to my sorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) against reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against happiness, against all discouragement that could be.
<p/>Once for all; I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) none the less because I knew it, and it had no more influence in restraining me than if I had devoutly believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) to be human perfection.
<p/>When I had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand, I turned my back upon the gate, while I tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart moderately quiet.
<p/>I heard the side-door open, and steps come across the courtyard; but I pretended not to hear, even when the gate swung on its rusty hinges.
<p/>I so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time. Being at last touched on the shoulder, I started and turned.
<p/>I started much more naturally then, to find myself confronted by a man in a sober gray dress. The last man I should have expected to see in that place of porter at Miss Havisham's door.
<p/>'' Orlick!'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, young master, there's more changes than yours. But come in, come in. It's opposed to my orders to hold the gate open.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I entered and he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) swung it, and locked it, and took the key out. '' Yes! '' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), facing round, after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards the house.
<p/>'' Here I am! '' <div class="bookquote">``How did you come here?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I come her (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) retorted, <div class="bookquote">``on my legs. I had my box brought alongside me in a barrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you here for good?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I ain't here for harm, young master, I suppose? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was not so sure of that.
<p/>I had leisure to entertain the retort in my mind, while he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) slowly lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) heavy glance from the pavement, up my legs and arms, to my face.
<p/>'' Then you have left the forge? '' I said. '' Do this look like a forge? '' replied Orlick, sending his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) glance all round him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) with an air of injury.
<p/>'' Now, do it look like it? '' I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had left Gargery's forge? '' One day is so like another here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``that I don't know without casting it up.
<p/>However, I come here some time since you left. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I could have told you that, Orlick.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), dryly.
<p/>By this time we had come to the house, where I found his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) room to be one just within the side-door, with a little window in it looking on the courtyard.
<p/>'' But then you've got to be a scholar. '' In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind of place usually assigned to a gate-porter in Paris.
<p/>Certain keys were hanging on the wall, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) now added the gate key; and his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) patchwork-covered bed was in a little inner division or recess.
<p/>The whole had a slovenly, confined, and sleepy look, like a cage for a human dormouse; while he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>), looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a corner by the window, looked like the human dormouse for whom it was fitted up,--as indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) was.
<p/>No,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``not till it got about that there was no protection on the premises, and it come to be considered dangerous, with convicts and Tag and Rag and Bobtail going up and down.
<p/>And then I was recommended to the place as a man who could give another man as good as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought, and I took it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I never saw this room before,'' I remarked; <div class="bookquote">``but there used to be no Porter here.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' It's easier than bellowsing and hammering.--That's loaded, that is.
<p/>My eye had been caught by a gun with a brass-bound stock over the chimney-piece, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Porter</b></font>) eye had followed mine.
<p/>'' '' Well,'' said I, not desirous of more conversation, <div class="bookquote">``shall I go up to Miss Havisham?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Burn me, if I know!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I give this here bell a rap with this here hammer, and you go on along the passage till you meet somebody.''
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Porter</b></font>) retorted, first stretching himself and then shaking himself; ``my orders ends here, young master. <div class="bookquote">``I am expected, I believe?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Burn me twice over, if I can say!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).
<p/>Upon that, I turned down the long passage which I had first trodden in my thick boots, and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) bell sound.
<p/>At the end of the passage, while the bell was still reverberating, I found Sarah Pocket, who appeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason of me.
<p/>'' Oh!'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>). '' You, is it, Mr. Pip?'' <div class="bookquote">``It is, Miss Pocket. I am glad to tell you that Mr. Pocket and family are all well.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are they any wiser?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah Pocket/Sarah/Miss Sarah Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Sarah, with a dismal shake of the head; <div class="bookquote">``they had better be wiser, than well.
<p/>Ah, Matthew, Matthew! You know your way, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah Pocket/Sarah/Miss Sarah Pocket</b></font>)</div>Tolerably, for I had gone up the staircase in the dark, many a time.
<p/>I ascended it now, in lighter boots than of yore, and tapped in my old way at the door of Miss Havisham's room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) chair near the old table, in the old dress, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) two hands crossed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) stick, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) chin resting on them, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) eyes on the fire.
<p/>Sitting near her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), with the white shoe, that had never been worn, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) hand, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) head bent as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) looked at it, was an elegant lady whom I had never seen.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come in, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without looking round or up; <div class="bookquote">``come in, Pip, how do you do, Pip?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>Pip's rap,'' I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) say, immediately; <div class="bookquote">``come in, Pip. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>so you kiss my hand as if I were a queen, eh?--Well?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard, Miss Havisham,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, rather at a loss, <div class="bookquote">``that you were so kind as to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) looked up at me suddenly, only moving her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) eyes, and repeated in a grimly playful manner,-- <div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Well?''
 (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div><p/>The lady whom I had never seen before, lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes and looked archly at me, and then I saw that the eyes were Estella's eyes.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was so much changed, was so much more beautiful, so much more womanly, in all things winning admiration, had made such wonderful advance, that I seemed to have made none.
<p/>I fancied, as I looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), that I slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again. O the sense of distance and disparity that came upon me, and the inaccessibility that came about her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)!
<p/>I stammered something about the pleasure I felt in seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) again, and about my having looked forward to it, for a long, long time.
<p/>Do you find her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) much changed, Pip?'' asked Miss Havisham, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) greedy look, and striking her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stick upon a chair that stood between them, as a sign to me to sit down there.
<p/>When I came in, Miss Havisham, I thought there was nothing of Estella in the face or figure; but now it all settles down so curiously into the old--
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) gave me her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand. '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``What? You are not going to say into the old Estella?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>Miss Havisham interrupted.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was proud and insulting, and you wanted to go away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>). Don't you remember? '' I said confusedly that that was long ago, and that I knew no better then, and the like.
<p/>Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had no doubt of my having been quite right, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) having been very disagreeable.
<p/>'' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) changed? '' Miss Havisham asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>). '' Very much,'' said Estella, looking at me. '' Less coarse and common?'' said Miss Havisham, playing with Estella's hair.
<p/>Estella laughed, and looked at the shoe in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand, and laughed again, and looked at me, and put the shoe down.
<p/>We sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had so wrought upon me, and I learnt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had but just come home from France, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was going to London.
<p/>Proud and wilful as of old, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had brought those qualities into such subjection to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) beauty that it was impossible and out of nature--or I thought so--to separate them from her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) beauty.
<p/>Truly it was impossible to dissociate her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) presence from all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had disturbed my boyhood,--from all those ill-regulated aspirations that had first made me ashamed of home and Joe,--from all those visions that had raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) face in the glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on the anvil, extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden window of the forge, and flit away.
<p/>In a word, it was impossible for me to separate her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), in the past or in the present, from the innermost life of my life.
<p/>It was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, and return to the hotel at night, and to London to-morrow.
<p/>When we had conversed for a while, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the neglected garden: on our coming in by and by, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) said, I should wheel her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) about a little, as in times of yore.
<p/>So, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I had strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert;
<p/>I, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) dress; she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) treated me as a boy still, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) lured me on. As we drew near to the place of encounter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) stopped and said,--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight that day; but I did, and I enjoyed it very much.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I remember I entertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it ill that he (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) should be brought here to pester me with his (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) company.''
<p/>'' You rewarded me very much.'' <div class="bookquote">``Did I? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) and I are great friends now.
<p/>I made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyish look, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) already treated me more than enough like a boy.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Are you? I think I recollect though, that you read with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes. ''  (<font color='red'><b>prospects</b></font>)</div>'' Since your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed your companions,'' said Estella.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And necessarily,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) added, in a haughty tone; <div class="bookquote">``what was fit company for you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.
<p/>In my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering intention left of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation put it to flight.
<p/>You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Estella, with a slight wave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand, signifying in the fighting times.
<p/>The air of completeness and superiority with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) walked at my side, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at hers, made a contrast that I strongly felt.
<p/>It would have rankled in me more than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being so set apart for her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) and assigned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>).
<p/>The garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and after we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again into the brewery yard.
<p/>I showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) to a nicety where I had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) walking on the casks, that first old day, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said, with a cold and careless look in that direction, ``Did I?
<p/>I reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had come out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I don't remember.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Naturally,'' said I. '' '' '' Not the least. '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Not remember that you made me cry?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) head and looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>).
<p/>I verily believe that her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry again, inwardly,--and that is the sharpest crying of all.
<p/>You must know,'' said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and beautiful woman might, <div class="bookquote">``that I have no heart,--if that has anything to do with my memory.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>'' I got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of doubting that. That I knew better.
<p/>That there could be no such beauty without it. '' Oh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in
<p/>, I have no doubt,'' said Estella, <div class="bookquote">``and of course if it ceased to beat I should cease to be. But you know what I mean.
<p/>I have no softness there, no--sympathy--sentiment--nonsense. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>What was it that was borne in upon my mind when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) stood still and looked attentively at me?
<p/>In some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looks and gestures there was that tinge of resemblance to Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have been acquired by children, from grown person with whom they have been much associated and secluded, and which, when childhood is passed, will produce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between faces that are otherwise quite different.
<p/>Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham? No. And yet I could not trace this to Miss Havisham. I looked again, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was still looking at me, the suggestion was gone.
<p/>I am serious,'' said Estella, not so much with a frown -LRB-for her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) brow was smooth-RRB- as with a darkening of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) face; <div class="bookquote">``if we are to be thrown much together, you had better believe it at once.
<p/>What was it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>No!'' imperiously stopping me as I opened my lips. '' I have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere.
<p/>In another moment we were in the brewery, so long disused, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) pointed to the high gallery where I had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) going out on that same first day, and told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) remembered to have been up there, and to have seen me standing scared below.
<p/>I have never had any such thing. '' As my eyes followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) white hand, again the same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossed me.
<p/>My involuntary start occasioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) to lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand upon my arm. Instantly the ghost passed once more and was gone.
<p/>What was it? '' What is the matter?'' asked Estella. '' Are you scared again?'' <div class="bookquote">``I should be, if I believed what you said just now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied, to turn it off.
<p/>Miss Havisham will soon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might be laid aside now, with other old belongings.
<p/>'' Then you don't? Very well. It is said, at any rate. Let us make one more round of the garden, and then go in.
<p/>Come! You shall not shed tears for my cruelty to-day; you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder. ''
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) handsome dress had trailed upon the ground. She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) held it in one hand now, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked.
<p/>If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of the old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, it could not have been more cherished in my remembrance.
<p/>There was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) far from me; we were of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for more in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) beauty and her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) manner gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), tormented me in the midst of my delight, and at the height of the assurance I felt that our patroness had chosen us for one another.
<p/>At last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise, that my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business, and would come back to dinner.
<p/>The old wintry branches of chandeliers in the room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while we were out, and Miss Havisham was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) chair and waiting for me.
<p/>It was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we began the old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast.
<p/>But, in the funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in the chair fixing its eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), Estella looked more bright and beautiful than before, and I was under stronger enchantment.
<p/>We walked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more, and it was all in bloom for me. Wretched boy! The time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand, and Estella left us to prepare herself.
<p/>We had stopped near the centre of the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) withered arms stretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow cloth.
<p/>As Estella looked back over her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) shoulder before going out at the door, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), with a ravenous intensity that was of its kind quite dreadful.
<p/>Then, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) turned to me, and said in a whisper,-- <div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) beautiful, graceful, well-grown?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to hers as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) sat in the chair.
<p/>Do you admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Everybody must who sees her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), Miss Havisham.

How does she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) use you?''
<p/>Before I could answer -LRB-if I could have answered so difficult a question at all-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``Love her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), love her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), love her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)!

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) favors you, love her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) wounds you, love her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>). Never had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) utterance of these words.
<p/>I could feel the muscles of the thin arm round my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>). '' Hear me, Pip!
<p/>I adopted her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), to be loved. I bred her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) and educated her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), to be loved. I developed her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) into what she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) is, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) might be loved.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) meant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of love--despair--revenge--
<p/>Love her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)!'' dire death--it could not have sounded from her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) lips more like a curse. '' I'll tell you,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), in the same hurried passionate whisper, <div class="bookquote">``what real love is.
<p/>It is blind devotion, unquestioning self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiter--as I did!
<p/>For she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) rose up in the chair, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) shroud of a dress, and struck at the air as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would as soon have struck herself against the wall and fallen dead.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) round the waist. All this passed in a few seconds.
<p/>As I drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) down into her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) chair, I was conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian in the room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) always carried -LRB-I have not yet mentioned it, I think-RRB- a pocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was of great value to him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) profession.
<p/>I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) so terrify a client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief as if he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) were immediately going to blow his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) nose, and then pausing, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) should not have time to do it before such client or witness committed himself, that the self-committal has followed directly, quite as a matter of course.
<p/>When I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) in the room he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) had this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and was looking at us. On meeting my eye, he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) said plainly, by a momentary and silent pause in that attitude, <div class="bookquote">``Indeed?
<p/>Singular!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then put the handkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect. Miss Havisham had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) as soon as I, and was -LRB-like everybody else-RRB- afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) made a strong attempt to compose herself, and stammered that he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) was as punctual as ever. '' As punctual as ever,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>client</b></font>) repeated, coming up to us.
<p/>'' -LRB-How do you do, Pip? Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham? Once round?-RRB- And so you are here, Pip?
<p/>'' I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) when I had arrived, and how Miss Havisham had wished me to come and see Estella. To which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) pushed Miss Havisham in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) chair before him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) large hands, and put the other in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) trousers-pocket as if the pocket were full of secrets.
<p/>Very fine young lady! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Well, Pip! How often have you seen Miss Estella before?'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) came to a stop.
<p/>'' How often?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! How many times? Ten thousand times?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! Certainly not so many. '' <div class="bookquote">``Twice?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jaggers,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief, <div class="bookquote">``leave my Pip alone, and go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) to your dinner.
<p/>While we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved yard at the back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eat and drink; offering me a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundred times and once.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together. I considered, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Never.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' And never will, Pip,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) retorted, with a frowning smile.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) has never allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) lived this present life of hers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``may I ask you a question?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' You may,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and I may decline to answer it.
<p/>Put your question.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Estella's name. Is it Havisham or--? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had nothing to add. '' Or what?'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Is it Havisham?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is Havisham. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This brought us to the dinner-table, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) and Sarah Pocket awaited us. Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), I faced my green and yellow friend.
<p/>We dined very well, and were waited on by a maid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, but who, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the whole time.
<p/>After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my guardian -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was evidently well acquainted with the vintage-RRB-, and the two ladies left us.
<p/>Anything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under that roof I never saw elsewhere, even in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) very looks to himself, and scarcely directed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) eyes to Estella's face once during dinner.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) listened, and in due course answered, but never looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), that I could see.
<p/>On the other hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) often looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) face never showed the least consciousness.
<p/>Throughout dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) took a dry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often referring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here, again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) extorted--and even did extort, though I don't know how--those references out of my innocent self.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) and I were left alone together, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) sat with an air upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) of general lying by in consequence of information he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) possessed, that really was too much for me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) held it between himself and the candle, tasted the port, rolled it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) mouth, swallowed it, looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) glass again, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, and cross-examined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I had known the wine to be telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) something to my disadvantage.
<p/>Three or four times I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) saw me going to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) anything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) looked at me with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) glass in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hand, and rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) wine about in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) mouth, as if requesting me to take notice that it was of no use, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) couldn't answer.
<p/>I think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) in the danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) cap,--which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop,--and strewing the ground with her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) cross-examined his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) very wine when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had nothing else in hand. hair,--which assuredly had never grown on her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) head. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss Havisham's room, and we four played at whist.
<p/>In the interval, Miss Havisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels from her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) dressing-table into Estella's hair, and about her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) bosom and arms; and I saw even my guardian look at her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) thick eyebrows, and raise them a little, when her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) loveliness was before him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), with those rich flushes of glitter and color in it.
<p/>Of the manner and extent to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) took our trumps into custody, and came out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which the glory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor, of the feeling that I had, respecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) looking upon us personally in the light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had found out long ago.
<p/>It was not that I knew I could never bear to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) about her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>), that I knew I could never bear to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) creak his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) boots at her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>), that I knew I could never bear to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) wash his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hands of her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>)
<p/>; it was, that my admiration should be within a foot or two of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>),--it was, that my feelings should be in the same place with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>),--that, was the agonizing circumstance.
<p/>We played until nine o'clock, and then it was arranged that when Estella came to London I should be forewarned of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) coming and should meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) at the coach; and then I took leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), and touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>).
<p/>What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) cold presence and my feelings towards Estella. My guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine.
<p/>I adapted them for my own repetition, and said to my pillow, ``I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)!
<p/>Far into the night, Miss Havisham's words, <div class="bookquote">``Love her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), love her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), love her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>sounded in my ears. '' hundreds of times.
<p/>Then I thought if she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) were, as I feared, by no means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet, when would she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) begin to be interested in me?
<p/>Then, a burst of gratitude came upon me, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) should be destined for me, once the blacksmith's boy. When should I awaken the heart within her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) that was mute and sleeping now?
<p/>But I never thought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe, because I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) would be contemptuous of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>It was but a day gone, and Joe had brought the tears into my eyes; they had soon dried, God forgive me! soon dried.
<p/>After well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Boar in the morning, I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlick's being the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss Havisham's.
<p/>Why of course he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not the right sort of man, Pip,'' said my guardian, comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head, <div class="bookquote">``because the man who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man.
<p/>It seemed quite to put him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into spirits to find that this particular post was not exceptionally held by the right sort of man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) listened in a satisfied manner while I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) what knowledge I had of Orlick.
<p/>Ah me! I thought those were high and great emotions. Chapter XXX ''  (<font color='red'><b>guardian man</b></font>)</div>'' '' Very good, Pip,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) observed, when I had concluded, <div class="bookquote">``I'll go round presently, and pay our friend off.
<p/>Rather alarmed by this summary action, I was for a little delay, and even hinted that our friend himself might be difficult to deal with.
<p/>Oh no he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said my guardian, making his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief-point, with perfect confidence; ``I should like to see him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) argue the question with me.
<p/>As we were going back together to London by the midday coach, and as I breakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcely hold my cup, this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted a walk, and that I would go on along the London road while Mr. Jaggers was occupied, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) would let the coachman know that I would get into my place when overtaken.
<p/>By then making a loop of about a couple of miles into the open country at the back of Pumblechook's premises, I got round into the High Street again, a little beyond that pitfall, and felt myself in comparative security.
<p/>It was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more, and it was not disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after.
<p/>One or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went a little way down the street before me, that they might turn, as if they had forgotten something, and pass me face to face,--on which occasions I don't know whether they or I made the worse pretence; they of not doing it, or I of not seeing it.
<p/>Still my position was a distinguished one, and I was not at all dissatisfied with it, until Fate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant, Trabb's boy.
<p/>Casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress, I beheld Trabb's boy approaching, lashing himself with an empty blue bag.
<p/>Deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would best beseem me, and would be most likely to quell his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) evil mind, I advanced with that expression of countenance, and was rather congratulating myself on my success, when suddenly the knees of Trabb's boy smote together, his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) hair uprose, his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) cap fell off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) trembled violently in every limb, staggered out into the road, and crying to the populace, <div class="bookquote">``Hold me!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the populace</b></font>)</div>'' '' I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boar immediately after breakfast. I'm so frightened! '' feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and contrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance.
<p/>As I passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) teeth loudly chattered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) head, and with every mark of extreme humiliation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) prostrated himself in the dust.
<p/>I had not advanced another two hundred yards when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement, and indignation, I again beheld Trabb's boy approaching.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) blue bag was slung over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shoulder, honest industry beamed in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb's with cheerful briskness was indicated in his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) gait.
<p/>With a shock he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) became aware of me, and was severely visited as before; but this time his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) motion was rotatory, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) staggered round and round me with knees more afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy.
<p/>This was a hard thing to bear, but this was nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) was coming round a narrow corner. His (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators, and I felt utterly confounded.
<p/>I had not got as much further down the street as the post-office, when I again beheld Trabb's boy shooting round by a back way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) wore the blue bag in the manner of my great-coat, and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of the street, attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) from time to time exclaimed, with a wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``Don't know yah!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Words cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon me by Trabb's boy, when passing abreast of me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) pulled up his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) shirt-collar, twined his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) side-hair, stuck an arm akimbo, and smirked extravagantly by, wriggling his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) elbows and body, and drawling to his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) attendants, <div class="bookquote">``Don't know yah, don't know yah, `pon
<p/>The disgrace attendant on his (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) immediately afterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows, as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was a blacksmith, culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and was, so to speak, ejected by it into the open country.
<p/>But unless I had taken the life of Trabb's boy on that occasion, I really do not even now see what I could have done save endure.
<p/>To have struggled with him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) in the street, or to have exacted any lower recompense from him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) than his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) heart's best blood, would have been futile and degrading.
<p/>Moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) was a boy whom no man could hurt; an invulnerable and dodging serpent who, when chased into a corner, flew out again between his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) captor's legs, scornfully yelping.
<p/>I wrote, however, to Mr. Trabb by next day's post, to say that Mr. Pip must decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) owed to the best interests of society, as to employ a boy who excited Loathing in every respectable mind.
<p/>The coach, with Mr. Jaggers inside, came up in due time, and I took my box-seat again, and arrived in London safe,--but not sound, for my heart was gone.
<p/>As soon as I arrived, I sent a penitential codfish and barrel of oysters to Joe -LRB-as reparation for not having gone myself-RRB-, and then went on to Barnard's Inn.

<p/>Having despatched The Avenger to the coffee-house for an addition to the dinner, I felt that I must open my breast that very evening to my friend and chum.
<p/>As confidence was out of the question with The Avenger in the hall, which could merely be regarded in the light of an antechamber to the keyhole, I sent him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to the Play.
<p/>A better proof of the severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded, than the degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven to find him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) employment.
<p/>Dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender, I said to Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``My dear Herbert, I have something very particular to tell you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>So mean is extremity, that I sometimes sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) to Hyde Park corner to see what o'clock it was.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>I stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture in my character. On the whole, I by no means recognized the analysis, but thought it not worth disputing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) makes tremendous rows,--roars, and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument. '' In looking at me and then laughing heartily, Herbert for the time recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) usual lively manner.

<p/>So, when I had pledged myself to comfort and abet Herbert in the affair of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) heart by all practicable and impracticable means, and when Herbert had told me that his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) affianced already knew me by reputation and that I should be presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), and when we had warmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence, we blew out our candles, made up our fire, locked our door, and issued forth in quest of Mr. Wopsle and Denmark.
<p/>On our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that country elevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court.
<p/>The whole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble boy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life, and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance.
<p/>My gifted townsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could have wished that his (<font color='blue'><b>Peer</b></font>) curls and forehead had been more probable.
<p/>The late king of the country not only appeared to have been troubled with a cough at the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) decease, but to have taken it with him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) to the tomb, and to have brought it back.
<p/>The royal phantom also carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had the appearance of occasionally referring, and that too, with an air of anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state of mortality.
<p/>It was this, I conceive, which led to the Shade's being advised by the gallery to <div class="bookquote">``turn over!'' (<font color='red'><b>the Shade</b></font>)</div>--a recommendation which it took extremely ill.
<p/>It was likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit, that whereas it always appeared with an air of having been out a long time and walked an immense distance, it perceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall.
<p/>The Queen of Denmark, a very buxom lady, though no doubt historically brazen, was considered by the public to have too much brass about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chin being attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) diadem by a broad band of that metal -LRB-as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had a gorgeous toothache-RRB-, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) waist being encircled by another, and each of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arms by another, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was openly mentioned as <div class="bookquote">``the kettle-drum.
<p/>The noble boy in the ancestral boots was inconsistent, representing himself, as it were in one breath, as an able seaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, a clergyman, and a person of the utmost importance at a Court fencing-match, on the authority of whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were judged.
<p/>This gradually led to a want of toleration for him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>), and even--on his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) being detected in holy orders, and declining to perform the funeral service--to the general indignation taking the form of nuts.
<p/>Lastly, Ophelia was a prey to such slow musical madness, that when, in course of time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried it, a sulky man who had been long cooling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) impatient nose against an iron bar in the front row of the gallery, growled,

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Which, to say the least of it, was out of keeping. Upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with playful effect.
<p/>As for example; on the question whether 'twas nobler in the mind to suffer, some roared yes, and some no, and some inclining to both opinions said <div class="bookquote">``Toss up for it;''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and quite a Debating Society arose.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) asked what should such fellows as he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) do crawling between earth and heaven, he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was encouraged with loud cries of <div class="bookquote">``Hear, hear!

<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) taking the recorders,--very like a little black flute that had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the door,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) was called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) recommended the player not to saw the air thus, the sulky man said, <div class="bookquote">``And don't you do it, neither; you're a deal worse than him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) greatest trials were in the churchyard, which had the appearance of a primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiastical wash-house on one side, and a turnpike gate on the other.
<p/>Mr. Wopsle in a comprehensive black cloak, being descried entering at the turnpike, the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way, ``Look out!
<p/>And I grieve to add that peals of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle on every one of these occasions. Here's the undertaker a coming, to see how you're a getting on with your work!
<p/>I believe it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr. Wopsle could not possibly have returned the skull, after moralizing over it, without dusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) fingers on a white napkin taken from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) breast; but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the comment, <div class="bookquote">``Wai-ter!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div><p/>The arrival of the body for interment -LRB-in an empty black box with the lid tumbling open-RRB-, was the signal for a general joy, which was much enhanced by the discovery, among the bearers, of an individual obnoxious to identification.
<p/>The joy attended Mr. Wopsle through his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) struggle with Laertes on the brink of the orchestra and the grave, and slackened no more until he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) had tumbled the king off the kitchen-table, and had died by inches from the ankles upward.
<p/>We had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr. Wopsle; but they were too hopeless to be persisted in.
<p/>I laughed in spite of myself all the time, the whole thing was so droll; and yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly fine in Mr. Wopsle's elocution,--not for old associations' sake, I am afraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary, very uphill and downhill, and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything.
<p/>When the tragedy was over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been called for and hooted, I said to Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``Let us go at once, or perhaps we shall meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>Therefore we had sat, feeling keenly for him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear. '' We made all the haste we could downstairs, but we were not quick enough either.
<p/>Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy smear of eyebrow, who caught my eyes as we advanced, and said, when we came up with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),-- <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Pip and friend?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Identity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed. '' Mr. Waldengarver,'' said the man, <div class="bookquote">``would be glad to have the honor.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Waldengarver? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated--when Herbert murmured in my ear, <div class="bookquote">``Probably Wopsle.''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Yes. Shall we follow you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>'' A few steps, please.
<p/>'' When we were in a side alley, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) turned and asked, <div class="bookquote">``How did you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) looked?--I dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>). ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had looked like, except a funeral; with the addition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) neck by a blue ribbon, that had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) the appearance of being insured in some extraordinary Fire Office.
<p/>But I said he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had looked very nice. '' When he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) come to the grave,'' said our conductor, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) showed his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) cloak beautiful.
<p/>But, judging from the wing, it looked to me that when he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) see the ghost in the queen's apartment, he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) might have made more of his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) stockings.
<p/>I modestly assented, and we all fell through a little dirty swing door, into a sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it.
<p/>Here Mr. Wopsle was divesting himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) Danish garments, and here there was just room for us to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) over one another's shoulders, by keeping the packing-case door, or lid, wide open.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>conductor</b></font>)</div>'' Gentlemen,'' said Mr. Wopsle, <div class="bookquote">``I am proud to see you. I hope, Mr. Pip, you will excuse my sending round.
<p/>I had the happiness to know you in former times, and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been acknowledged, on the noble and the affluent.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>Meanwhile, Mr. Waldengarver, in a frightful perspiration, was trying to get himself out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) princely sables. '' Skin the stockings off Mr. Waldengarver,'' said the owner of that property, <div class="bookquote">``or you'll bust 'em.
<p/>Bust 'em, and you'll bust five-and-thirty shillings. Shakspeare never was complimented with a finer pair. Keep quiet in your chair now, and leave 'em to me.
<p/>With that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) went upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) knees, and began to flay his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) victim; who, on the first stocking coming off, would certainly have fallen over backward with his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) chair, but for there being no room to fall anyhow.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the owner</b></font>)</div>I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play. But then, Mr. Waldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said,--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen, how did it seem to you, to go, in front?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Waldengarver</b></font>)</div>Herbert said from behind -LRB-at the same time poking me-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``Capitally.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>So I said <div class="bookquote">``Capitally.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Waldengarver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Waldengarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage.
<p/>Herbert said from behind -LRB-again poking me-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``Massive and concrete. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>So I said boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to insist upon it, <div class="bookquote">``Massive and concrete.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Waldengarver</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Waldengarver, with an air of dignity, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) being ground against the wall at the time, and holding on by the seat of the chair.
<p/>But I'll tell you one thing, Mr. Waldengarver,'' said the man who was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) knees, <div class="bookquote">``in which you're out in your reading.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Now mind! I don't care who says contrairy; I tell you so. You're out in your reading of Hamlet when you get your legs in profile.
<p/>The last Hamlet as I dressed, made the same mistakes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) reading at rehearsal, till I got him (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) to put a large red wafer on each of his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) shins, and then at that rehearsal -LRB-which was the last-RRB-
<p/>I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, and whenever his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) reading brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) into profile, I called out <div class="bookquote">``I don't see no wafers!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And at night his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) reading was lovely. '' Mr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say <div class="bookquote">``a faithful Dependent--I overlook his (<font color='blue'><b>Waldengarver</b></font>) folly;''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and then said aloud,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My view is a little classic and thoughtful for them here; but they will improve, they will improve.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Herbert and I said together, O, no doubt they would improve.
<p/>Did you observe, gentlemen,'' said Mr. Waldengarver, <div class="bookquote">``that there was a man in the gallery who endeavored to cast derision on the service,--I
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Waldengarver</b></font>)</div>mean, the representation? '' We basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man. I added, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was drunk, no doubt.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O dear no, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wopsle, <div class="bookquote">``not drunk. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) employer would see to that, sir. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) employer would not allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) to be drunk.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) employer?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I. Mr. Wopsle shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) eyes, and opened them again; performing both ceremonies very slowly.
<p/>You must have observed, gentlemen,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``an ignorant and a blatant ass, with a rasping throat and a countenance expressive of low malignity, who went through--I will not say sustained--the rôle -LRB-if I may use a French expression-RRB- of Claudius, King of Denmark.
<p/>Without distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry for Mr. Wopsle if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) had been in despair, I was so sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) as it was, that I took the opportunity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) turning round to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) braces put on,--which
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That is his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) employer, gentlemen. Such is the profession!'' jostled us out at the doorway,--to ask Herbert what he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) thought of having him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) home to supper?
<p/>; therefore I invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) went to Barnard's with us, wrapped up to the eyes, and we did our best for him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) sat until two o'clock in the morning, reviewing his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) success and developing his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) plans.
<p/>I forget in detail what they were, but I have a general recollection that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was to begin with reviving the Drama, and to end with crushing it; inasmuch as his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) decease would leave it utterly bereft and without a chance or hope.
<p/>Miserably I went to bed after all, and miserably thought of Estella, and miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled, and that I had to give my hand in marriage to Herbert's Clara, or play Hamlet to Miss Havisham's Ghost, before twenty thousand people, without knowing twenty words of it.
<p/>One day when I was busy with my books and Mr. Pocket, I received a note by the post, the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter; for, though I had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed, I divined whose hand it was.
<p/>It had no set beginning, as Dear Mr. Pip, or Dear Pip, or Dear Sir, or Dear Anything, but ran thus:--
<p/>Herbert said he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) thought it would be kind to do so Chapter XXXII <div class="bookquote">``I am to come to London the day after to-morrow by the midday coach.
<p/>I believe it was settled you should meet me? At all events Miss Havisham has that impression, and I write in obedience to it.
<p/>If there had been time, I should probably have ordered several suits of clothes for this occasion; but as there was not, I was fain to be content with those I had.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) sends you her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) regard. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Yours, ESTELLA. '' My appetite vanished instantly, and I knew no peace or rest until the day arrived.
<p/>Not that its arrival brought me either; for, then I was worse than ever, and began haunting the coach-office in Wood Street, Cheapside, before the coach had left the Blue Boar in our town.
<p/>, I still felt as if it were not safe to let the coach-office be out of my sight longer than five minutes at a time; and in this condition of unreason I had performed the first half-hour of a watch of four or five hours, when Wemmick ran against me.
<p/>For all that I knew this perfectly well '' Halloa, Mr. Pip,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``how do you do? I should hardly have thought this was your beat.
<p/>I explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by coach, and I inquired after the Castle and the Aged.
<p/>I have a notion of firing eighty-two times, if the neighborhood shouldn't complain, and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Both flourishing thankye,'' said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``and particularly the Aged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)'s in wonderful feather. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)'ll be eighty-two next birthday. However, this is not London talk.
<p/>Where do you think I am going to?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To the office?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was tending in that direction. ''
<p/>We are in a banker's-parcel case just at present, and I have been down the road taking a squint at the scene of action, and thereupon must have a word or two with our client.''
<p/>Next thing to it,'' returned Wemmick, ``I am going to Newgate. <div class="bookquote">``Did your client commit the robbery? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. ''
<p/>Bless your soul and body, no,'' answered Wemmick, very drily. '' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) is accused of it. So might you or I be.
<p/>Either of us might be accused of it, you know. '' <div class="bookquote">``Only neither of us is,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked. '' Yah!'' said Wemmick, touching me on the breast with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) forefinger; <div class="bookquote">``you're a deep one, Mr. Pip!
<p/>I had so much time to spare, that the proposal came as a relief, notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my eye on the coach-office.
<p/>Muttering that I would make the inquiry whether I had time to walk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), I went into the office, and ascertained from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) temper, the earliest moment at which the coach could be expected,--which
<p/>Would you like to have a look at Newgate? Have you time to spare? ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I knew beforehand, quite as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>).
<p/>I then rejoined Mr. Wemmick, and affecting to consult my watch, and to be surprised by the information I had received, accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) offer.
<p/>We were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed through the lodge where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison rules, into the interior of the jail.
<p/>At that time jails were much neglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all public wrongdoing--and which is always its heaviest and longest punishment--was still far off.
<p/>So, felons were not lodged and fed better than soldiers -LRB-to say nothing of paupers-RRB-, and seldom set fire to their prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavor of their soup.
<p/>It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in, and a potman was going his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) rounds with beer; and the prisoners, behind bars in yards, were buying beer, and talking to friends; and a frowzy, ugly, disorderly, depressing scene it was.
<p/>This was first put into my head by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) seeing a shoot that had come up in the night, and saying, <div class="bookquote">``What, Captain Tom?
<p/>It struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener might walk among his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) plants. Are you there?
<p/>Ah, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and also, <div class="bookquote">``Is that Black Bill behind the cistern? Why I didn't look for you these two months; how do you find yourself?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>Equally in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) stopping at the bars and attending to anxious whisperers,--always singly,--Wemmick with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) post-office in an immovable state, looked at them while in conference, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) were taking particular notice of the advance they had made, since last observed, towards coming out in full blow at their trial.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was highly popular, and I found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) took the familiar department of Mr. Jaggers's business; though something of the state of Mr. Jaggers hung about him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) settling his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hat a little easier on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head with both hands, and then tightening the post-office, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) pockets.
<p/>In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the raising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick, backing as far as possible from the insufficient money produced, said, ``it's no use, my boy.
<p/>If you are unable to make up your quantum, my boy, you had better address yourself to a principal; there are plenty of principals in the profession, you know, and what is not worth the while of one, may be worth the while of another
<p/>I'm only a subordinate. I can't take it. Don't go on in that way with a subordinate. ; that's my recommendation to you, speaking as a subordinate.
<p/>Thus, we walked through Wemmick's greenhouse, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) turned to me and said, <div class="bookquote">``Notice the man I shall shake hands with.
<p/>Don't try on useless measures. Why should you? Now, who's next? ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' I should have done so, without the preparation, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had shaken hands with no one yet.
<p/>Almost as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had spoken, a portly upright man -LRB-whom I can see now, as I write-RRB- in a well-worn olive-colored frock-coat, with a peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) complexion, and eyes that went wandering about when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried to fix them, came up to a corner of the bars, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat--which had a greasy and fatty surface like cold broth--with a half-serious and half-jocose military salute.
<p/>'' Colonel, to you! '' said Wemmick; <div class="bookquote">``how are you, Colonel?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>'' All right, Mr. Wemmick. '' '' Everything was done that could be done, but the evidence was too strong for us, Colonel.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, it was too strong, sir,--but I don't care. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, coolly, <div class="bookquote">``you don't care. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>Then, turning to me, <div class="bookquote">``Served His (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) Majesty this man.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and the man's eyes looked at me, and then looked over my head, and then looked all round me, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) lips and laughed.
<p/>Was a soldier in the line and bought his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) discharge. '' I said, <div class="bookquote">``Indeed? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) said to Wemmick.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to have the chance of bidding you good-bye, Mr. Wemmick,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hand between two bars.
<p/>'' Perhaps,'' returned my friend, <div class="bookquote">``but there's no knowing. ''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>'' Thankye,'' said Wemmick, shaking hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>). '' Same to you, Colonel.''
<p/>If what I had upon me when taken had been real, Mr. Wemmick,'' said the man, unwilling to let his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hand go, <div class="bookquote">``I should have asked the favor of your wearing another ring--in acknowledgment of your attentions.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``I'll accept the will for the deed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick. '' By the by; you were quite a pigeon-fancier. ''
<p/>The man looked up at the sky. '' I am told you had a remarkable breed of tumblers. Could you commission any friend of yours to bring me a pair, if you've no further use for 'em?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It shall be done, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>'' All right,'' said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``they shall be taken care of. Good afternoon, Colonel. Good-bye! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>They shook hands again, and as we walked away Wemmick said to me, <div class="bookquote">``A Coiner, a very good workman. The Recorder's report is made to-day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) is sure to be executed on Monday.
<p/>With that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) looked back, and nodded at this dead plant, and then cast his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) eyes about him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) in walking out of the yard, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) were considering what other pot would go best in its place.
<p/>As we came out of the prison through the lodge, I found that the great importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys, no less than by those whom they held in charge.
<p/>Well, Mr. Wemmick,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said the turnkey, who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates, and who carefully locked one before he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) unlocked the other, <div class="bookquote">``what's Mr. Jaggers going to do with that water-side murder?
<p/>Still you see, as far as it goes, a pair of pigeons are portable property all the same. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) going to make it manslaughter, or what's he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) going to make of it?
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Wemmick. '' O yes, I dare say!'' said the turnkey. '' Now, that's the way with them here, Mr. Pip,'' remarked Wemmick, turning to me with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) post-office elongated.
<p/>They don't mind what they ask of me, the subordinate; but you'll never catch 'em asking any questions of my principal.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this young gentleman one of the `prentices or articled ones of your office?''  (<font color='red'><b>the turnkey</b></font>)</div>asked the turnkey, with a grin at Mr. Wemmick's humor.
<p/>'' '' There he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) goes again, you see!'' cried Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``I told you so! Asks another question of the subordinate before his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) first is dry!
<p/>Well, supposing Mr. Pip is one of them?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why then,''  (<font color='red'><b>the turnkey</b></font>)</div>said the turnkey, grinning again, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) knows what Mr. Jaggers is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the turnkey</b></font>)</div><p/>'' cried Wemmick, suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious way, ``you're dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my principal, you know you are.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yah! Let us out, you old fox, or I'll get him (<font color='blue'><b>fox</b></font>) to bring an action against you for false imprisonment. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>The turnkey</b></font>)</div><p/>The turnkey laughed, and gave us good day, and stood laughing at us over the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street.
<p/>Mind you, Mr. Pip,'' said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) took my arm to be more confidential; <div class="bookquote">``I don't know that Mr. Jaggers does a better thing than the way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) keeps himself so high.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)'s always so high. His (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) constant height is of a piece with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) immense abilities. That Colonel durst no more take leave of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), than that turnkey durst ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) intentions respecting a case.
<p/>Then, between his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) height and them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) slips in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) subordinate,--don't you see?--and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) has 'em, soul and body. ''
<p/>To confess the truth, I very heartily wished, and not for the first time, that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities.
<p/>Mr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where suppliants for Mr. Jaggers's notice were lingering about as usual, and I returned to my watch in the street of the coach-office, with some three hours on hand.
<p/>I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime; that, in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening, I should have first encountered it; that, it should have reappeared on two occasions, starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone; that, it should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement.
<p/>While my mind was thus engaged, I thought of the beautiful young Estella, proud and refined, coming towards me, and I thought with absolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>).
<p/>I wished that Wemmick had not met me, or that I had not yielded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) and gone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), so that, of all days in the year on this day, I might not have had Newgate in my breath and on my clothes.
<p/>I beat the prison dust off my feet as I sauntered to and fro, and I shook it out of my dress, and I exhaled its air from my lungs.
<p/>So contaminated did I feel, remembering who was coming, that the coach came quickly after all, and I was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmick's conservatory, when I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) face at the coach window and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hand waving to me.
<p/>I was very much impressed, and not for the first time, by my guardian's subtlety. What was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed?
<p/>Chapter XXXIII In her (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) furred travelling-dress, Estella seemed more delicately beautiful than she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had ever seemed yet, even in my eyes.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) manner was more winning than she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had cared to let it be to me before, and I thought I saw Miss Havisham's influence in the change.
<p/>We stood in the Inn Yard while she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) pointed out her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) luggage to me, and when it was all collected I remembered--having forgotten everything but herself in the meanwhile--that I knew nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) destination.
<p/>Our lesson is, that there are two Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is the Surrey Richmond.
<p/>'' I am going to Richmond,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) told me. '' The distance is ten miles. I am to have a carriage, and you are to take me.
<p/>This is my purse, and you are to pay my charges out of it. O, you must take the purse! We have no choice, you and I, but to obey our instructions.
<p/>We are not free to follow our own devices, you and I.'' As she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looked at me in giving me the purse, I hoped there was an inner meaning in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) words.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said them slightingly, but not with displeasure. '' A carriage will have to be sent for, Estella. Will you rest here a little?''
<p/>``Yes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you are to take care of me the while.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) arm through mine, as if it must be done, and I requested a waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen such a thing in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life, to show us a private sitting-room.
<p/>Upon that, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clew without which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't find the way upstairs, and led us to the black hole of the establishment, fitted up with a diminishing mirror -LRB-quite a superfluous article, considering the hole's proportions-RRB-, an anchovy sauce-cruet, and somebody's pattens.
<p/>On my objecting to this retreat, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took us into another room with a dinner-table for thirty, and in the grate a scorched leaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust.
<p/>which, proving to be merely, <div class="bookquote">``Some tea for the lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>sent him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out of the room in a very low state of mind.
<p/>I was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strong combination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer that the coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department.
<p/>'' Having looked at this extinct conflagration and shaken his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) took my order; Yet the room was all in all to me, Estella being in it.
<p/>I thought that with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) I could have been happy there for life. -LRB-I was not at all happy there at the time, observe, and I knew it well.-RRB-
<p/>I am going to live,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``at a great expense, with a lady there, who has the power--or says she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) has--of taking me about, and introducing me, and showing people to me and showing me to people.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Where are you going to, at Richmond? '' I asked Estella. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I suppose so. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) answered so carelessly, that I said, <div class="bookquote">``You speak of yourself as if you were some one else.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Come, come,'' said Estella, smiling delightfully, ``you must not expect me to go to school to you; I must talk in my own way.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where did you learn how I speak of others? How do you thrive with Mr. Pocket?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I live quite pleasantly there; at least--''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>It appeared to me that I was losing a chance.
<p/>'' At least?'' repeated Estella. '' As pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you. '' <div class="bookquote">``You silly boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, quite composedly, <div class="bookquote">``how can you talk such nonsense?
<p/>Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) family?''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very superior indeed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) is nobody's enemy--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't add but his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>interposed Estella, <div class="bookquote">``for I hate that class of man. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and spite, I have heard?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/>You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) people,'' said Estella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once grave and rallying, ``for they beset Miss Havisham with reports and insinuations to your disadvantage.
<p/>They watch you, misrepresent you, write letters about you -LRB-anonymous sometimes-RRB-, and you are the torment and the occupation of their lives.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure I have every reason to say so. ''  (<font color='red'><b>those people</b></font>)</div>'' You can scarcely realize to yourself the hatred those people feel for you.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They do me no harm, I hope? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>Instead of answering, Estella burst out laughing. This was very singular to me, and I looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) in considerable perplexity.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) left off--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had not laughed languidly, but with real enjoyment--I said, in my diffident way with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>),-- ''
<p/>I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any harm. '' '' No, no you may be sure of that,'' said Estella.
<p/>'' You may be certain that I laugh because they fail. O, those people with Miss Havisham, and the tortures they undergo!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) laughed again, and even now when she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had told me why, her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) laughter was very singular to me, for I could not doubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too much for the occasion.
<p/>I thought there must really be something more here than I knew; she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) saw the thought in my mind, and answered it.
<p/>It is not easy for even you.'' said Estella, <div class="bookquote">``to know what satisfaction it gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense of the ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous.
<p/>You had not your little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressed and defenceless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that is soft and soothing.
<p/>You did not gradually open your round childish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a woman who calculates her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stores of peace of mind for when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wakes up in the night.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>'' For you were not brought up in that strange house from a mere baby. I was. I had. I did.
<p/>'' It was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) summoning these remembrances from any shallow place. I would not have been the cause of that look of hers for all my expectations in a heap.
<p/>First, notwithstanding the proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set your mind at rest that these people never will--never would, in hundred years--impair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, great or small.
<p/>Second, I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so busy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand upon it.
<p/>'' Two things I can tell you,'' said Estella. '' '' As she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) gave it to me playfully,--for her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) darker mood had been but Momentary,--I held it and put it to my lips.
<p/>'' You ridiculous boy,'' said Estella, <div class="bookquote">``will you never take warning? Or do you kiss my hand in the same spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What spirit was that?'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``I must think a moment. A spirit of contempt for the fawners and plotters.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>'' If I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?'' <div class="bookquote">``You should have asked before you touched the hand.
<p/>Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, gliding away the instant I touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) cheek, <div class="bookquote">``you are to take care that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us, and we were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in our intercourse did give me pain.
<p/>Whatever her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) tone with me happened to be, I could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I went on against trust and against hope.
<p/>But, yes, if you like. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I leaned down, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) calm face was like a statue's. '' '' Why repeat it a thousand times?
<p/>I rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) magic clew, brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment, but of tea not a glimpse.
<p/>A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives and forks -LRB-including carvers-RRB-, spoons -LRB-various-RRB-, saltcellars, a meek little muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover, Moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a quantity of parsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proof impressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of bread, and ultimately a fat family urn; which the waiter staggered in with, expressing in his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) countenance burden and suffering.
<p/>After a prolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment, he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) at length came back with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs.
<p/>These I steeped in hot water, and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of I don't know what for Estella.
<p/>The bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not forgotten, and the chambermaid taken into consideration,--in a word, the whole house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Estella's purse much lightened,--we got into our post-coach and drove away.
<p/>So it always was. Turning into Cheapside and rattling up Newgate Street, we were soon under the walls of which I was so ashamed.
<p/>'' What place is that?'' Estella asked me. I made a foolish pretence of not at first recognizing it, and then told her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>).
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looked at it, and drew in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) head again, murmuring, <div class="bookquote">``Wretches! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I would not have confessed to my visit for any consideration.
<p/>Mr. Jaggers,'' said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else, <div class="bookquote">``has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place than any man in London.''
 (<font color='red'><b>somebody</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is more in the secrets of every place, I think,'' said Estella, in a low voice. '' You have been accustomed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) often, I suppose?
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I have been accustomed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at uncertain intervals, ever since I can remember. But I know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no better now, than I did before I could speak plainly.
<p/>What is your own experience of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Do you advance with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Once habituated to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) distrustful manner,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``I have done very well.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you intimate?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have dined with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) private house.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I fancy,'' said Estella, shrinking <div class="bookquote">``that must be a curious place.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/>I should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>); but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe the dinner in Gerrard Street, if we had not then come into a sudden glare of gas.
<p/>It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alive with that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were out of it, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in lightning.
<p/>So we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by which we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on this side of it, and what on that.
<p/>The great city was almost new to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) told me, for she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had never left Miss Havisham's neighborhood until she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had gone to France, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had merely passed through London then in going and returning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a curious place. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) if my guardian had any charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) remained here?
<p/>It was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cared to attract me; that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) made herself winning, and would have won me even if the task had needed pains.
<p/>Yet this made me none the happier, for even if she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I should have felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) held my heart in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hand because she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wilfully chose to do it, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to crush it and throw it away.
<p/>When we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) where Mr. Matthew Pocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that I hoped I should see her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sometimes.
<p/>O yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think proper; you are to be mentioned to the family; indeed you are already mentioned.
<p/>To that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) emphatically said <div class="bookquote">``God forbid!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and no more. '' '' I inquired was it a large household she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was going to be a member of?
<p/>'' No; there are only two; mother and daughter. The mother is a lady of some station, though not averse to increasing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) income.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a part of Miss Havisham's plans for me, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, with a sigh, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) were tired; <div class="bookquote">``I am to write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) constantly and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) regularly and report how I go on,--I and the jewels,--for
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>they are nearly all mine now. '' It was the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had ever called me by my name.
<p/>We came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there was a house by the green,--a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches, embroidered coats, rolled stockings, ruffles and swords, had had their court days many a time.
<p/>Some ancient trees before the house were still cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and stiff skirts; but their own allotted places in the great procession of the dead were not far off, and they would soon drop into them and go the silent way of the rest.
<p/>A bell with an old voice--which I dare say in its time had often said to the house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamond-hilted sword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire--sounded gravely in the moonlight, and two cherry-colored maids came fluttering out to receive Estella.
<p/>The doorway soon absorbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) boxes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) gave me her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand and a smile, and said good night, and was absorbed likewise.
<p/>And still I stood looking at the house, thinking how happy I should be if I lived there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), and knowing that I never was happy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), but always miserable.
<p/>I got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith, and I got in with a bad heart-ache, and I got out with a worse heart-ache.
<p/>At our own door, I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little party escorted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) little lover; and I envied her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) little lover, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) being subject to Flopson.
<p/>Mr. Pocket was out lecturing; for, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) was a most delightful lecturer on domestic economy, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) treatises on the management of children and servants were considered the very best text-books on those themes.
<p/>But Mrs. Pocket was at home, and was in a little difficulty, on account of the baby's having been accommodated with a needle-case to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) quiet during the unaccountable absence -LRB-with a relative in the Foot Guards-RRB- of Millers.
<p/>And more needles were missing than it could be regarded as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either to apply externally or to take as a tonic.
<p/>Mr. Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical advice, and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a highly judicious mind, I had some notion in my heart-ache of begging him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) to accept my confidence.
<p/>But happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) sat reading her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) book of dignities after prescribing Bed as a sovereign remedy for baby, I thought--
<p/>As I had grown accustomed to my expectations, I had insensibly begun to notice their effect upon myself and those around me.
<p/>Their influence on my own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible, but I knew very well that it was not all good.
<p/>Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) did so purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up. Well--No, I wouldn't. Chapter XXXIV I lived in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to Joe.
<p/>When I woke up in the night,--like Camilla,--I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits, that I should have been happier and better if I had never seen Miss Havisham's face, and had risen to manhood content to be partners with Joe in the honest old forge.
<p/>Many a time of an evening, when I sat alone looking at the fire, I thought, after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the kitchen fire at home.
<p/>Yet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of mind, that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part in its production.
<p/>That is to say, supposing I had had no expectations, and yet had had Estella to think of, I could not make out to my satisfaction that I should have done much better.
<p/>Now, concerning the influence of my position on others, I was in no such difficulty, and so I perceived--though dimly enough perhaps--that it was not beneficial to anybody, and, above all, that it was not beneficial to Herbert.
<p/>My lavish habits led his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) easy nature into expenses that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) could not afford, corrupted the simplicity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) life, and disturbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) peace with anxieties and regrets.
<p/>I was not at all remorseful for having unwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor arts they practised; because such littlenesses were their natural bent, and would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left them slumbering.
<p/>But Herbert's was a very different case, and it often caused me a twinge to think that I had done him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) evil service in crowding his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work, and placing the Canary-breasted Avenger at his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) disposal.
<p/>My conscience was not by any means comfortable about Biddy. So now, as an infallible way of making little ease great ease, I began to contract a quantity of debt.
<p/>At Startop's suggestion, we put ourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the Grove: the object of which institution I have never divined, if it were not that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, to quarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to cause six waiters to get drunk on the stairs.
<p/>I know that these gratifying social ends were so invariably accomplished, that Herbert and I understood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the society: which ran <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen, may the present promotion of good feeling ever reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove.
<p/>The Finches spent their money foolishly -LRB-the Hotel we dined at was in Covent Garden-RRB-, and the first Finch I saw when I had the honor of joining the Grove was Bentley Drummle, at that time floundering about town in a cab of his (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>) own, and doing a great deal of damage to the posts at the street corners.
<p/>Occasionally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>) shot himself out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>) equipage headforemost over the apron; and I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>) on one occasion deliver himself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way--like coals.
<p/>But here I anticipate a little, for I was not a Finch, and could not be, according to the sacred laws of the society, until I came of age.
<p/>In my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have taken Herbert's expenses on myself; but Herbert was proud, and I could make no such proposal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).
<p/>I could hardly begin but Herbert must begin too, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) soon followed. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) got into difficulties in every direction, and continued to look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).
<p/>When we gradually fell into keeping late hours and late company, I noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) with a desponding eye at breakfast-time; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) began to look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) more hopefully about mid-day; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) drooped when he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) came into dinner; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) seemed to descry Capital in the distance, rather clearly, after dinner; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) all but realized Capital towards midnight; and that at about two o'clock in the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) became so deeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to America, with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) fortune.
<p/>I was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I was at Hammersmith I haunted Richmond, whereof separately by and by.
<p/>Herbert would often come to Hammersmith when I was there, and I think at those seasons his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) father would occasionally have some passing perception that the opening he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was looking for, had not appeared yet.
<p/>But in the general tumbling up of the family, his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) tumbling out in life somewhere, was a thing to transact itself somehow.
<p/>While Mrs. Pocket tripped up the family with her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) footstool, read her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) book of dignities, lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief, told us about her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) grandpapa, and taught the young idea how to shoot, by shooting it into bed whenever it attracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) notice.
<p/>As I am now generalizing a period of my life with the object of clearing my way before me, I can scarcely do so better than by at once completing the description of our usual manners and customs at Barnard's Inn.
<p/>We spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as people could make up their minds to give us.
<p/>In the meantime Mr. Pocket grew grayer, and tried oftener to lift himself out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) perplexities by the hair. We were always more or less miserable, and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition.
<p/>There was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying ourselves, and a skeleton truth that we never did.
<p/>To the best of my belief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common one. Every morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City to look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).
<p/>I often paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) a visit in the dark back-room in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) consorted with an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, an almanac, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that I ever saw him (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>) do anything else but look about him (<font color='blue'><b>ruler</b></font>).
<p/>If we all did what we undertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in a Republic of the Virtues.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had nothing else to do, poor fellow, except at a certain hour of every afternoon to <div class="bookquote">``go to Lloyd's'' (<font color='red'><b>fellow</b></font>)</div>--in observance of a ceremony of seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) principal, I think.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) case unusually serious, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) positively must find an opening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) would go on `Change at a busy time, and walk in and out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among the assembled magnates.
<p/>For,'' says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner on one of those special occasions, <div class="bookquote">``I find the truth to be, Handel, that an opening won't come to one, but one must go to it,--so
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) never did anything else in connection with Lloyd's that I could find out, except come back again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I have been.
<p/>'' If we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated one another regularly every morning.
<p/>I detested the chambers beyond expression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the sight of the Avenger's livery; which had a more expensive and a less remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the four-and-twenty hours.
<p/>As we got more and more into debt, breakfast became a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion at breakfast-time threatened -LRB-by letter-RRB- with legal proceedings, <div class="bookquote">``not unwholly unconnected,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>as my local paper might put it, <div class="bookquote">``with jewelery,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I went so far as to seize the Avenger by his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) blue collar and shake him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) off his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) feet,--so that he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was actually in the air, like a booted Cupid,--for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll.
<p/>At certain times--meaning at uncertain times, for they depended on our humor--I would say to Herbert, as if it were a remarkable discovery,--
<p/>My dear Handel,'' Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, <div class="bookquote">``if you will believe me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange coincidence.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>'' My dear Herbert, we are getting on badly. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Then, Herbert,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I would respond, <div class="bookquote">``let us look into our affairs.
<p/>I always thought this was business, this was the way to confront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat.
<p/>We ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of something similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds might be fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the mark.
<p/>Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of ink, and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>We always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for this purpose. And I know Herbert thought so too. For there was something very comfortable in having plenty of stationery.
<p/>I would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in a neat hand, the heading, <div class="bookquote">``Memorandum of Pip's debts'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>; with Barnard's Inn and the date very carefully added.
<p/>Each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnard</b></font>) side, which had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half burnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, and otherwise damaged.
<p/>The sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly, insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually paying the money.
<p/>Herbert would also take a sheet of paper, and write across it with similar formalities, <div class="bookquote">``Memorandum of Herbert's debts. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>In point of meritorious character, the two things seemed about equal.
<p/>When we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) got on? Herbert probably would have been scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) head in a most rueful manner at the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) accumulating figures.
<p/>'' They are mounting up, Handel,'' Herbert would say; <div class="bookquote">``upon my life, they are mounting up.''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Be firm, Herbert,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I would retort, plying my own pen with great assiduity.
<p/>'' Look the thing in the face. Look into your affairs. Stare them out of countenance.'' '' So I would, Handel, only they are staring me out of countenance.
<p/>After a time he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) would give up once more, on the plea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) had not got Cobbs's bill, or Lobbs's, or Nobbs's, as the case might be.
<p/>'' However, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert would fall to work again. '' Then, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put it down.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What a fellow of resource you are! ''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>my friend would reply, with admiration. '' Really your business powers are very remarkable.
<p/>'' I thought so too. I established with myself, on these occasions, the reputation of a first-rate man of business,--prompt, decisive, energetic, clear, cool-headed.
<p/>When I had got all my responsibilities down upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off.
<p/>When I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly, docketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical bundle.
<p/>Then I did the same for Herbert -LRB-who modestly said he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had not my administrative genius-RRB-, and felt that I had brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) affairs into a focus for him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).
<p/>My self-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation. My business habits had one other bright feature, which I called ``leaving a Margin.
<p/>For example; supposing Herbert's debts to be one hundred and sixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say, <div class="bookquote">``Leave a margin, and put them down at two hundred.
<p/>Or, supposing my own to be four times as much, I would leave a margin, and put them down at seven hundred.
<p/>I had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin, but I am bound to acknowledge that on looking back, I deem it to have been an expensive device.
<p/>For, we always ran into new debt immediately, to the full extent of the margin, and sometimes, in the sense of freedom and solvency it imparted, got pretty far on into another margin.
<p/>But there was a calm, a rest, a virtuous hush, consequent on these examinations of our affairs that gave me, for the time, an admirable opinion of myself.
<p/>Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herbert's compliments, I would sit with his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) symmetrical bundle and my own on the table before me among the stationary, and feel like a Bank of some sort, rather than a private individual.
<p/>I had fallen into my serene state one evening, when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door, and fall on the ground.
<p/>It's for you, Handel,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, going out and coming back with it, <div class="bookquote">``and I hope there is nothing the matter.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>'' We shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that we might not be interrupted. '' ''
<p/>The letter was signed Trabb & Co., and its contents were simply, that I was an honored sir, and that they begged to inform me that Mrs. J. Gargery had departed this life on Monday last at twenty minutes past six in the evening, and that my attendance was requested at the interment on Monday next at three o'clock in the afternoon.
<p/>It was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, and the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful.
<p/>This was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border. Chapter XXXV The figure of my sister in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day.
<p/>That the place could possibly be, without her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), was something my mind seemed unable to compass; and whereas she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had seldom or never been in my thoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was coming towards me in the street, or that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would presently knock at the door.
<p/>In my rooms too, with which she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had never been at all associated, there was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) voice or the turn of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) face or figure, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) were still alive and had been often there.
<p/>Whatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have recalled my sister with much tenderness. But I suppose there is a shock of regret which may exist without much tenderness.
<p/>Under its influence -LRB-and perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling-RRB- I was seized with a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had suffered so much; and I felt that on sufficient proof I could have revengefully pursued Orlick, or any one else, to the last extremity.
<p/>Having written to Joe, to offer him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) consolation, and to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) that I would come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in the curious state of mind I have glanced at.
<p/>I went down early in the morning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to the forge.
<p/>It was fine summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the times when I was a little helpless creature, and my sister did not spare me, vividly returned.
<p/>For now, the very breath of the beans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be softened as they thought of me.
<p/>At last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co. had put in a funereal execution and taken possession.
<p/>Two dismally absurd persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black bandage,--as if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort to anybody,--were posted at the front door; and in one of them I recognized a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young couple into a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence of intoxication rendering it necessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to ride his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) horse clasped round the neck with both arms.
<p/>All the children of the village, and most of the women, were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house and forge; and as I came up, one of the two warders -LRB-the postboy-RRB- knocked at the door,--implying that I was far too much exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.
<p/>Another sable warder -LRB-a carpenter, who had once eaten two geese for a wager-RRB- opened the door, and showed me into the best parlor.
<p/>Here, Mr. Trabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got all the leaves up, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantity of black pins.
<p/>At the moment of my arrival, he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) had just finished putting somebody's hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby; so he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) hand for mine.
<p/>But I, misled by the action, and confused by the occasion, shook hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) with every testimony of warm affection.
<p/>Poor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow under his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room; where, as chief mourner, he (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>) had evidently been stationed by Trabb.
<p/>But they returned with a gentle tone upon them that softened even the edge of Tickler. When I bent down and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>mourner</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Dear Joe, how are you?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Pip, old chap, you knowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) were a fine figure of a--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and clasped my hand and said no more.
<p/>When I had spoken to Biddy, as I thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, and there began to wonder in what part of the house it--
<p/>Biddy, looking very neat and modest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) black dress, went quietly here and there, and was very helpful. she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)--my sister--was.
<p/>, I looked about for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visible until one had got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plum cake upon it, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, and biscuits, and two decanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but had never seen used in all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry.
<p/>Standing at this table, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook in a black cloak and several yards of hatband, who was alternately stuffing himself, and making obsequious movements to catch my attention.
<p/>The moment he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) succeeded, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) came over to me -LRB-breathing sherry and crumbs-RRB-, and said in a subdued voice, <div class="bookquote">``May I, dear sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and did.
<p/>The air of the parlor being faint with the smell of sweet-cake I then descried Mr. and Mrs. Hubble; the last-named in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner.
<p/>We were all going to <div class="bookquote">``follow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Trabb/Mr. Trabb</b></font>)</div>and were all in course of being tied up separately -LRB-by Trabb-RRB- into ridiculous bundles.
<p/>Which I meantersay, Pip,'' Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr. Trabb called <div class="bookquote">``formed''  (<font color='red'><b>Trabb/Mr. Trabb</b></font>)</div>in the parlor, two and two,--and
<p/>it was dreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance; <div class="bookquote">``which I meantersay, sir, as I would in preference have carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) to the church myself, along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it with willing harts and arms, but it were considered wot the neighbors would look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in respect.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Trabb/Mr. Trabb</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Pocket-handkerchiefs out, all!''  (<font color='red'><b>Trabb/Mr. Trabb</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Trabb at this point, in a depressed business-like voice. '' Pocket-handkerchiefs out! We are ready!
<p/>So we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our noses were bleeding, and filed out two and two;
<p/>The remains of my poor sister had been brought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point of Undertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a horrible black velvet housing with a white border, the whole looked like a blind monster with twelve human legs, shuffling and blundering along, under the guidance of two keepers,--the postboy and his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) comrade.
<p/>The neighborhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and we were much admired as we went through the village; the more youthful and vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off, and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage.
<p/>At such times the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our emergence round some corner of expectancy, <div class="bookquote">``Here they come!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Joe and I; Biddy and Pumblechook; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. <div class="bookquote">``Here they are! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and we were all but cheered.
<p/>In this progress I was much annoyed by the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persisted all the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband, and smoothing my cloak.
<p/>My thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession.
<p/>And now the range of marshes lay clear before us, with the sails of the ships on the river growing out of it; and we went into the churchyard, close to the graves of my unknown parents, Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above.
<p/>And there, my sister was laid quietly in the earth, while the larks sang high above it, and the light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees.
<p/>Of the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing, I desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me; and that even when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought nothing into the world and can take nothing out, and
<p/>how it fleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay, I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cough a reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came unexpectedly into large property.
<p/>When we got back, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had the hardihood to tell me that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wished my sister could have known I had done her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) so much honor, and to hint that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would have considered it reasonably purchased at the price of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) death.
<p/>After that, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) drank all the rest of the sherry, and Mr. Hubble drank the port, and the two talked -LRB-which I have since observed to be customary in such cases-RRB- as if they were of quite another race from the deceased, and were notoriously immortal.
<p/>, I felt sure, and to tell the Jolly Bargemen that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bargemen</b></font>) was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest benefactor.
<p/>When they were all gone, and when Trabb and his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) men--but not his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) Boy; I looked for him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>)--had crammed their mummery into bags, and were gone too, the house felt wholesomer.
<p/>Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had a cold dinner together; but we dined in the best parlor, not in the old kitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) did with his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not, that there was great restraint upon us.
<p/>But after dinner, when I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) take his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) pipe, and when I had loitered with him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) about the forge, and when we sat down together on the great block of stone outside it, we got on better.
<p/>I noticed that after the funeral Joe changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) clothes so far, as to make a compromise between his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) Sunday dress and working dress; in which the dear fellow looked natural, and like the Man he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) was.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little room, and I was pleased too
<p/>Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) went away with Mr. and Mrs. Hubble,--to make an evening of it ; for I felt that I had done rather a great thing in making the request.
<p/>When the shadows of evening were closing in, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a little talk.
<p/>'' Biddy,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``I think you might have written to me about these sad matters. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you, Mr. Pip?''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I consider that you ought to have thought that.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), that I did not like the thought of making her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) cry again.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I should have written if I had thought that.'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Do you, Mr. Pip? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>After looking a little at her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) downcast eyes as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) walked beside me, I gave up that point.
<p/>'' I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddy dear?'' '' Oh! I can't do so, Mr. Pip,'' said Biddy, in a tone of regret but still of quiet conviction.
<p/>'' I have been speaking to Mrs. Hubble, and I am going to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) to-morrow. I hope we shall be able to take some care of Mr. Gargery, together, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) settles down.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``How are you going to live, Biddy? If you want any mo--''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How am I going to live? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>repeated Biddy, striking in, with a momentary flush upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hubble</b></font>) face.
<p/>'' I'll tell you, Mr. Pip. I am going to try to get the place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here.
<p/>I can be well recommended by all the neighbors, and I hope I can be industrious and patient, and teach myself while I teach others.
<p/>You know, Mr. Pip,'' pursued Biddy, with a smile, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) eyes to my face, <div class="bookquote">``the new schools are not like the old, but I learnt a good deal from you after that time, and have had time since then to improve.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Except in my bad side of human nature,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>murmured Biddy.
<p/>It was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud. Well! I thought I would give up that point too.
<p/>So, I walked a little further with Biddy, looking silently at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) downcast eyes. '' I have not heard the particulars of my sister's death, Biddy.''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had been in one of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bad states--though they had got better of late, rather than worse--for four days, when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) came out of it in the evening, just at tea-time, and said quite plainly, `Joe.'
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had never said any word for a long while, I ran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) made signs to me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) to sit down close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), and wanted me to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) neck.
<p/>'' They are very slight, poor thing. So I put them round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) neck, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gargery</b></font>) shoulder quite content and satisfied.
<p/>And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) never lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head up any more, and it was just an hour later when we laid it down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) own bed, because we found she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was gone.''
<p/>Biddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that were coming out, were blurred in my own sight.
<p/>And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) presently said `Joe' again, and once `Pardon,' and once `Pip.' '' Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy? '' <div class="bookquote">``Nothing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know what is become of Orlick?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I should think from the color of his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) clothes that he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) is working in the quarries.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course you have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) then?--Why are you looking at that dark tree in the lane?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) there, on the night she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) died.
<p/>No; I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) there, since we have been walking here.--It is of no use,''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) hand upon my arm, as I was for running out, <div class="bookquote">``you know I would not deceive you
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That was not the last time either, Biddy?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) was not there a minute, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) is gone.
<p/>It revived my utmost indignation to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was still pursued by this fellow, and I felt inveterate against him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).
<p/>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) so, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) out of that country.
<p/>By degrees she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) led me into more temperate talk, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) told me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>)
<p/>'' didn't say, of me; she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had no need; I knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) meant,--but ever did his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) duty in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a gentle heart.
<p/>Indeed, it would be hard to say too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>),'' said I; <div class="bookquote">``and Biddy, we must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be often down here now.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am not going to leave poor Joe alone.'' Biddy said never a single word. '' Biddy, don't you hear me?''
<p/>'' Yes, Mr. Pip. '' <div class="bookquote">``Not to mention your calling me Mr. Pip,--which appears to me to be in bad taste,
<p/>Biddy,--what do you mean? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' What do I mean?'' asked Biddy, timidly. '' Biddy,'' said I, in a virtuously self-asserting manner, <div class="bookquote">``I must request to know what you mean by this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' By this?'' said Biddy. '' Now, don't echo,'' I retorted. '' You used not to echo, Biddy.'' <div class="bookquote">``Used not!''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>said Biddy.
<p/>'' O Mr. Pip! Used! '' Well! I rather thought I would give up that point too. After another silent turn in the garden, I fell back on the main position.
<p/>Biddy,'' said I, ``I made a remark respecting my coming down here often, to see Joe, which you received with a marked silence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) often?''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>asked Biddy, stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking at me under the stars with a clear and honest eye.
<p/>'' Have the goodness, Biddy, to tell me why.'' '' O dear me!'' said I, as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in despair.
<p/>'' This really is a very bad side of human nature! Don't say any more, if you please, Biddy. This shocks me very much.
<p/>For which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, and when I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) as I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the churchyard and the event of the day.
<p/>As often as I was restless in the night, and that was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what an unkindness, what an injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me.
<p/>'' Early in the morning I was to go. Early in the morning I was out, and looking in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge.
<p/>There I stood, for minutes, looking at Joe, already at work with a glow of health and strength upon his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face that made it show as if the bright sun of the life in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) were shining on it.
<p/>'' Good-bye, dear Joe!--No, don't wipe it off--for God's sake, give me your blackened hand!--I shall be down soon and often.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Never too soon, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``and never too often, Pip!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milk and a crust of bread.
<p/>'' Biddy,'' said I, when I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) my hand at parting, <div class="bookquote">``I am not angry, but I am hurt. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, don't be hurt,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) pleaded quite pathetically; <div class="bookquote">``let only me be hurt, if I have been ungenerous. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Once more, the mists were rising as I walked away.
<p/>If they disclosed to me, as I suspect they did, that I should not come back, and that Biddy was quite right, all I can say is,--they were quite right too.
<p/>Chapter XXXVI Herbert and I went on from bad to worse, in the way of increasing our debts, looking into our affairs, leaving Margins, and the like exemplary transactions; and Time went on, whether or no, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) has a way of doing; and I came of age,--in fulfilment of Herbert's prediction, that I should do so before I knew where I was.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had nothing else than his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) majority to come into, the event did not make a profound sensation in Barnard's Inn.
<p/>But we had looked forward to my one-and-twentieth birthday, with a crowd of speculations and anticipations, for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly help saying something definite on that occasion.
<p/>Herbert himself had come of age eight months before me. I had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain when my birthday was.
<p/>On the day before it, I received an official note from Wemmick, informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would call upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day.
<p/>This convinced us that something great was to happen, and threw me into an unusual flutter when I repaired to my guardian's office, a model of punctuality.
<p/>In the outer office Wemmick offered me his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) congratulations, and incidentally rubbed the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) nose with a folded piece of tissue-paper that I liked the look of.
<p/>It was November, and my guardian was standing before his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) fire leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) back against the chimney-piece, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hands under his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) coattails.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) said nothing respecting it, and motioned me with a nod into my guardian's room. '' Well, Pip ,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I must call you Mr. Pip to-day.
<p/>Congratulations, Mr. Pip. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>We shook hands,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) was always a remarkably short shaker,--and I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>). '' Take a chair, Mr. Pip,'' said my guardian.
<p/>As I sat down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) preserved his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) attitude and bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) brows at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) boots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time when I had been put upon a tombstone.
<p/>The two ghastly casts on the shelf were not far from him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), and their expression was as if they were making a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.
<p/>Now my young friend,'' my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the box, <div class="bookquote">``I am going to have a word or two with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a witness</b></font>)</div><p/>What do you suppose,'' said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the ground, and then throwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head back to look at the ceiling,--<div class="bookquote">``what
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>'' If you please, sir. '' '' do you suppose you are living at the rate of?'' <div class="bookquote">``At the rate of, sir?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling, <div class="bookquote">``the--rate--of? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>And then looked all round the room, and paused with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hand, half-way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) nose.
<p/>I had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed any slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings.
<p/>This reply seemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, <div class="bookquote">``I thought so!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>and blew his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) nose with an air of satisfaction.
<p/>Reluctantly, I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question. '' Now, I have asked you a question, my friend,'' said Mr. Jaggers.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several questions, sir; but I remember your prohibition.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Have you anything to ask me?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ask one,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers. <div class="bookquote">``Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No. Ask another.'' <div class="bookquote">``Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Waive that, a moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``and ask another.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>I looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from the inquiry, ``Have-I--anything to receive, sir?
<p/>On that, Mr. Jaggers said, triumphantly, <div class="bookquote">``I thought we should come to it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>and called to Wemmick to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) that piece of paper.
<p/>You have been drawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick's cash-book; but you are in debt, of course?''
<p/>'' Wemmick appeared, handed it in, and disappeared. '' Now, Mr. Pip,'' said Mr. Jaggers, ``attend, if you please. <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I must say yes, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>``I don't ask you what you owe, because you don't know; and if you did know, you wouldn't tell me; you would say less.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know you must say yes; don't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers. '' Yes, sir.'' Yes, yes, my friend,'' cried Mr. Jaggers, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) forefinger to stop me as I made a show of protesting:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``it's likely enough that you think you wouldn't, but you would. You'll excuse me, but I know better than you. Now, take this piece of paper in your hand.
<p/>You have got it? Very good. Now, unfold it and tell me what it is.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' This is a bank-note,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``for five hundred pounds.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' That is a bank-note,'' repeated Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``for five hundred pounds. And a very handsome sum of money too, I think.
<p/>You consider it so? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How could I do otherwise!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! But answer the question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers. '' Undoubtedly.'' <div class="bookquote">``You consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money.
<p/>Now, that handsome sum of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on this day, in earnest of your expectations.
<p/>And at the rate of that handsome sum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until the donor of the whole appears.
<p/>That is to say, you will now take your money affairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw from Wemmick one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter, until you are in communication with the fountain-head, and no longer with the mere agent.
<p/>As I have told you before, I am the mere agent. I execute my instructions, and I am paid for doing so.
<p/>I was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great liberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me.
<p/>I am not paid, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), coolly, <div class="bookquote">``to carry your words to any one;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then gathered up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) coat-tails, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had gathered up the subject, and stood frowning at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) boots as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) suspected them of designs against him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>).
<p/>I think them injudicious, but I am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits. '' '' After a pause, I hinted,-- ''
<p/>There was a question just now, Mr. Jaggers, which you desired me to waive for a moment. I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again?
<p/>I might have known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) would never help me out; but it took me aback to have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new.
<p/>Is it likely,'' I said, after hesitating, <div class="bookquote">``that my patron, the fountain-head you have spoken of, Mr. Jaggers, will soon--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>there I delicately stopped.
<p/>'' '' What is it?'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>). '' '' Will soon what?'' asked Mr. Jaggers. '' That's no question as it stands, you know.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Will soon come to London,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, after casting about for a precise form of words, <div class="bookquote">``or summon me anywhere else?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) dark deep-set eyes, <div class="bookquote">``we must revert to the evening when we first encountered one another in your village.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>What did I tell you then, Pip?'' <div class="bookquote">``You told me, Mr. Jaggers, that it might be years hence when that person appeared.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>As we looked full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in my strong desire to get something out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>).
<p/>And as I felt that it came quicker, and as I felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) saw that it came quicker, I felt that I had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``that's my answer. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>'' Do you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr. Jaggers?
<p/>Mr. Jaggers shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head,--not in negativing the question, but in altogether negativing the notion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) could anyhow be got to answer it,--and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked, when my eyes strayed up to them, as if they had come to a crisis in their suspended attention, and were going to sneeze.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, warming the backs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) legs with the backs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) warmed hands, <div class="bookquote">``I'll be plain with you, my friend Pip.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>That's a question I must not be asked. You'll understand that better, when I tell you it's a question that might compromise me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) bent down so low to frown at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) boots, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) was able to rub the calves of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) legs in the pause he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) made.
<p/>Come! I'll go a little further with you; I'll say something more. '' '' When that person discloses,'' said Mr. Jaggers, straightening himself, <div class="bookquote">``you and that person will settle your own affairs.
<p/>When that person discloses, my part in this business will cease and determine. When that person discloses, it will not be necessary for me to know anything about it.
<p/>And that's all I have got to say. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>We looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes, and looked thoughtfully at the floor.
<p/>From this last speech I derived the notion that Miss Havisham, for some reason or no reason, had not taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) confidence as to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) designing me for Estella; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) resented this, and felt a jealousy about it; or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) really did object to that scheme, and would have nothing to do with it.
<p/>When I raised my eyes again, I found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had been shrewdly looking at me all the time, and was doing so still.
<p/>'' If that is all you have to say, sir,'' I remarked, <div class="bookquote">``there can be nothing left for me to say.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) nodded assent, and pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) thief-dreaded watch, and asked me where I was going to dine? I replied at my own chambers, with Herbert.
<p/>As a necessary sequence, I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) would favor us with his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) company, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) promptly accepted the invitation.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) insisted on walking home with me, in order that I might make no extra preparation for him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and first he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had a letter or two to write, and -LRB-of course-RRB- had his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) hands to wash.
<p/>The fact was, that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket, a thought had come into my head which had been often there before; and it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise with concerning such thought.
<p/>So I said I would go into the outer office and talk to Wemmick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had already locked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) safe, and made preparations for going home.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) desk, brought out his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) two greasy office candlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near the door, ready to be extinguished; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had raked his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) fire low, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hat and great-coat ready, and was beating himself all over the chest with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) safe-key, as an athletic exercise after business.
<p/>Wemmick tightened his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) post-office and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) head, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) opinion were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.
<p/>'' Mr. Wemmick,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``I want to ask your opinion. I am very desirous to serve a friend. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>This friend,'' I pursued, <div class="bookquote">``is trying to get on in commercial life, but has no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a beginning.
<p/>Now I want somehow to help him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to a beginning. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``With money down?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.
<p/>With some money down,'' I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot across me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home--<div class="bookquote">``with some money down, and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``I should like just to run over with you on my fingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high as Chelsea Reach.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) safe-key on the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Let's see; there's London, one; Southwark, two; Blackfriars, three; Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>'' There's as many as six, you see, to choose from.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Choose your bridge, Mr. Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``and take a walk upon your bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch of your bridge, and you know the end of it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>Serve a friend with it, and you may know the end of it too,--but it's a less pleasant and profitable end.
<p/>'' I could have posted a newspaper in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mouth, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) made it so wide after saying this. '' This is very discouraging,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``Meant to be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick.
<p/>Then is it your opinion,'' I inquired, with some little indignation, <div class="bookquote">``that a man should never--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''--Invest portable property in a friend?'' said Wemmick.
<p/>'' '' Certainly he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) should not. Unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) wants to get rid of the friend,--and then it becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>).''
<p/>'' And that,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``is your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' That,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``is my deliberate opinion in this office.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, pressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), for I thought I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) near a loophole here; <div class="bookquote">``but would that be your opinion at Walworth?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) replied, with gravity, <div class="bookquote">``Walworth is one place, and this office is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is another.
<p/>They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments must be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken in this office.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, much relieved, <div class="bookquote">``then I shall look you up at Walworth, you may depend upon it.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``you will be welcome there, in a private and personal capacity.
<p/>We had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my guardian's ears to be the sharpest of the sharp.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) now appeared in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) doorway, towelling his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) hands, Wemmick got on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) great-coat and stood by to snuff out the candles.
<p/>We all three went into the street together, and from the door-step Wemmick turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) way, and Mr. Jaggers and I turned ours.
<p/>I could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggers had had an Aged in Gerrard Street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or a Somebody, to unbend his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) brows a little.
<p/>It was an uncomfortable consideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at all seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) made of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than Wemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to dinner.
<p/>And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy, because, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) eyes fixed on the fire, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) must have committed a felony and forgotten the details of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) felt so dejected and guilty.
<p/>Chapter XXXVII Deeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmick's Walworth sentiments, I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage to the Castle.
<p/>On arriving before the battlements, I found the Union Jack flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show of defiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a most pacific manner by the Aged.
<p/>My son, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, <div class="bookquote">``rather had it in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind that you might happen to drop in, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left word that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would soon be home from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) afternoon's walk.
<p/>I nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, and we went in and sat down by the fireside.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) is very regular in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) walks, is my son. Very regular in everything, is my son. '' ''
<p/>You made acquaintance with my son, sir,'' said the old man, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chirping way, while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) warmed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands at the blaze, <div class="bookquote">``at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) office, I expect?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I nodded. '' Hah! I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand at his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) business, sir? '' I nodded hard.
<p/>Which makes it more surprising in my son,'' said the old man, ``for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not brought up to the Law, but to the Wine-Coopering.
<p/>Curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the reputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) threw me into the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very sprightly manner, ``No, to be sure; you're right.
<p/>And to this hour I have not the faintest notion what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) meant, or what joke he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) thought I had made.
<p/>As I could not sit there nodding at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) perpetually, without making some other attempt to interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), I shouted at inquiry whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) own calling in life had been <div class="bookquote">``the Wine-Coopering.
<p/>By dint of straining that term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on the chest to associate it with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), I at last succeeded in making my meaning understood.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Yes; so they tell me. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) business is the Law? '' I nodded harder. '' '' '' '' '' No,'' said the old gentleman; <div class="bookquote">``the warehousing, the warehousing.
<p/>First, over yonder;''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman warehousing</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) intended to refer me to Liverpool; <div class="bookquote">``and then in the City of London here.
<p/>--Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me, my son he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) went into the Law, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) took charge of me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) by little and little made out this elegant and beautiful property.
<p/>But returning to what you said, you know,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>pursued the old man, again laughing heartily, ``what I say is, No to be sure; you're right.
<p/>I was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled me to say anything that would have amused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) half as much as this imaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall on one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little wooden flap with <div class="bookquote">``JOHN''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>upon it.
<p/>However, having an infirmity--for I am hard of hearing, sir-- '' I expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment. '' '' The old man, following my eyes, cried with great triumph,
<p/>It was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the other side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it with the greatest ease.
<p/>The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge, that I made no offer to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but stood quiet until Wemmick had come across, and had presented me to Miss Skiffins; a lady by whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was accompanied.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My son's come home!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Skiffins</b></font>)</div>and we both went out to the drawbridge. Miss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) escort, in the post-office branch of the service.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) might have been some two or three years younger than Wemmick, and I judged her (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) to stand possessed of portable property.
<p/>The cut of her (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) dress from the waist upward, both before and behind, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) figure very like a boy's kite; and I might have pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) gown a little too decidedly orange, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) gloves a little too intensely green.
<p/>I was not long in discovering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) was a frequent visitor at the Castle; for, on our going in, and my complimenting Wemmick on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) ingenious contrivance for announcing himself to the Aged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) begged me to give my attention for a moment to the other side of the chimney, and disappeared.
<p/>Presently another click came, and another little door tumbled open with <div class="bookquote">``Miss Skiffins''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Skiffins</b></font>)</div>on it; then Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open; then Miss Skiffins and John both tumbled open together, and finally shut up together.
<p/>On Wemmick's return from working these mechanical appliances, I expressed the great admiration with which I regarded them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, you know, they're both pleasant and useful to the Aged.
<p/>And by George, sir, it's a thing worth mentioning, that of all the people who come to this gate, the secret of those pulls is only known to the Aged, Miss Skiffins, and me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) seemed to be a good sort of fellow, and showed a high regard for the Aged. '' And Mr. Wemmick made them,'' added Miss Skiffins, <div class="bookquote">``with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) own hands out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) own head.
<p/>While Miss Skiffins was taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) bonnet -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) retained her (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) green gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was company-RRB-, Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) round the property, and see how the island looked in wintertime.
<p/>Thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) did this to give me an opportunity of taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) Walworth sentiments, I seized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Skiffins</b></font>)</div>Having thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I had never hinted at it before.
<p/>I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in behalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) how we had first met, and how we had fought.
<p/>I glanced at Herbert's home, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) character, and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) having no means but such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was dependent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) father for; those, uncertain and unpunctual.
<p/>I alluded to the advantages I had derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) society, and I confessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) might have done better without me and my expectations.
<p/>Keeping Miss Havisham in the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the possibility of my having competed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) prospects, and at the certainty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) possessing a generous soul, and being far above any mean distrusts, retaliations, or designs.
<p/>For all these reasons -LRB-I told Wemmick-RRB-, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was my young companion and friend, and I had a great affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), I wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick's experience and knowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my resources to help Herbert to some present income,--say of a hundred a year, to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) in good hope and heart,--and gradually to buy him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) on to some small partnership.
<p/>I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to understand that my help must always be rendered without Herbert's knowledge or suspicion, and that there was no one else in the world with whom I could advise.
<p/>I wound up by laying my hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) shoulder, and saying, ``I can't help confiding in you, though I know it must be troublesome to you; but that is your fault, in having ever brought me here.
<p/>Wemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind of start, <div class="bookquote">``Well you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>This is devilish good of you.'' <div class="bookquote">``Say you'll help me to be good then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Ecod,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>replied Wemmick, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``that's not my trade.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Nor is this your trading-place,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``You are right,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) returned. '' You hit the nail on the head.
<p/>Mr. Pip, I'll put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do may be done by degrees. Skiffins -LRB-that's her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) brother-RRB- is an accountant and agent.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the contrary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I thank you, for though we are strictly in our private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there are Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away.
<p/>After a little further conversation to the same effect, we returned into the Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea.
<p/>The responsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, and that excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) seemed to me in some danger of melting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>I'll look him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) up and go to work for you.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I thank you ten thousand times.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' It was no nominal meal that we were going to make, but a vigorous reality.
<p/>The Aged prepared such a hay-stack of buttered toast, that I could scarcely see him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) over it as it simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top-bar; while Miss Skiffins brewed such a jorum of tea, that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited, and repeatedly expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) desire to participate in the entertainment.
<p/>The flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the right moment of time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep.
<p/>Nothing disturbed the tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open of John and Miss Skiffins: which little doors were a prey to some spasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I got used to it.
<p/>I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss Skiffins's arrangements that she (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) made tea there every Sunday night; and I rather suspected that a classic brooch she (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) wore, representing the profile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon, was a piece of portable property that had been given her (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) by Wemmick.
<p/>We ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it was delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it.
<p/>After a short pause of repose, Miss Skiffins--in the absence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the bosom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) family on Sunday afternoons--washed up the tea-things, in a trifling lady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us.
<p/>Then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) gloves again, and we drew round the fire, and Wemmick said, <div class="bookquote">``Now, Aged Parent, tip us the paper.
<p/>Wemmick explained to me while the Aged got his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) spectacles out, that this was according to custom, and that it gave the old gentleman infinite satisfaction to read the news aloud.
<p/>The Aged especially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage tribe, just oiled. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>'' I won't offer an apology,'' said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``for he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) isn't capable of many pleasures--are you, Aged P.?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>'' All right, John, all right,'' returned the old man, seeing himself spoken to. '' Only tip him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) a nod every now
<p/>and then when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) looks off his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) paper,'' said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)'ll be as happy as a king. We are all attention,
<p/>Aged One.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>'' All right, John, all right! '' returned the cheerful old man, so busy and so pleased, that it really was quite charming.
<p/>The Aged's reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle's great-aunt's, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come through a keyhole.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) wanted the candles close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>), and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) was always on the verge of putting either his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) head or the newspaper into them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) required as much watching as a powder-mill.
<p/>But Wemmick was equally untiring and gentle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) vigilance, and the Aged read on, quite unconscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) many rescues.
<p/>As Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a shadowy corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr. Wemmick's mouth, powerfully suggestive of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) slowly and gradually stealing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) arm round Miss Skiffins's waist.
<p/>In course of time I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment Miss Skiffins neatly stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) with the green glove, unwound his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) arm again as if it were an article of dress, and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the table before her (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>).
<p/>Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) looked at us, we all expressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) resumed again. Miss Skiffins's composure while she (<font color='blue'><b>Skiffins</b></font>) did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever seen, and
<p/>if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction of mind, I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it mechanically.
<p/>By and by, I noticed Wemmick's arm beginning to disappear again, and gradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) mouth began to widen again.
<p/>After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite enthralling and almost painful, I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins.
<p/>Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness of a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid it on the table.
<p/>Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am justified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged's reading, Wemmick's arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to it by Miss Skiffins.
<p/>This was the time for Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a black bottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect.
<p/>With the aid of these appliances we all had something warm to drink, including the Aged, who was soon awake again.
<p/>At last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber. Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) and Wemmick drank out of one glass.
<p/>Of course I knew better than to offer to see Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I had best go first; which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, and having passed a pleasant evening.
<p/>Before a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth, stating that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had made some advance in that matter appertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) would be glad if I could come and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) again upon it.
<p/>So, I went out to Walworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) by appointment in the City several times, but never held any communication with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) on the subject in or near Little Britain.
<p/>The upshot was, that we found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long established in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted capital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner.
<p/>Between him (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) and me, secret articles were signed of which Herbert was the subject, and I paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) half of my five hundred pounds down, and engaged for sundry other payments: some, to fall due at certain dates out of my income: some, contingent on my coming into my property.
<p/>Miss Skiffins's brother conducted the negotiation. Wemmick pervaded it throughout, but never appeared in it. The whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not the least suspicion of my hand being in it.
<p/>I never shall forget the radiant face with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) came home one afternoon, and told me, as a mighty piece of news, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) having fallen in with one Clarriker -LRB-the young merchant's name-RRB-, and of Clarriker's having shown an extraordinary inclination towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) belief that the opening had come at last.
<p/>Day by day as his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) hopes grew stronger and his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) face brighter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) must have thought me a more and more affectionate friend, for I had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph when I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) so happy.
<p/>At length, the thing being done, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) having that day entered Clarriker's House, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) having talked to me for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success, I did really cry in good earnest when I went to bed, to think that my expectations had done some good to somebody.
<p/>But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to all the changes it involved, I must give one chapter to Estella.
<p/>A great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on my view. It is not much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart.
<p/>If that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come to be haunted when I am dead, it will be haunted, surely, by my ghost.
<p/>O the many, many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within me haunted that house when Estella lived there!
<p/>The lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs. Brandley by name, was a widow, with one daughter several years older than Estella.
<p/>The mother looked young, and the daughter looked old; the mother's complexion was pink, and the daughter's was yellow; the mother set up for frivolity, and the daughter for theology.
<p/>Chapter XXXVIII Let my body be where it would, my spirit was always wandering, wandering, wandering, about that house. They were in what is called a good position, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of people.
<p/>Little, if any, community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella, but the understanding was established that they were necessary to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was necessary to them.
<p/>In Mrs. Brandley's house and out of Mrs. Brandley's house, I suffered every kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me.
<p/>The nature of my relations with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), which placed me on terms of familiarity without placing me on terms of favor, conduced to my distraction.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) made use of me to tease other admirers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) turned the very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a constant slight on my devotion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>).
<p/>Mrs. Brandley had been a friend of Miss Havisham's before the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>) seclusion. If I had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>) secretary, steward, half-brother, poor
<p/>I had been a younger brother of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>) appointed husband,--I could not have seemed to myself further from my hopes when I was nearest to her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>).
<p/>The privilege of calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>) name and hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>) call me by mine became, under the circumstances an aggravation of my trials; and while I think it likely that it almost maddened her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>) other lovers, I know too certainly that it almost maddened me.
<p/>No doubt my jealousy made an admirer of every one who went near her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>); but there were more than enough of them without that.
<p/>I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>) often at Richmond, I heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>) often in town, and I used often to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>) and the Brandleys on the water; there were picnics, fête days, plays, operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures, through which I pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>),--and they were all miseries to me.
<p/>I never had one hour's happiness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>) society, and yet my mind all round the four-and-twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>) with me unto death.
<p/>Throughout this part of our intercourse,--and it lasted, as will presently be seen, for what I then thought a long time,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>) habitually reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced upon us.
<p/>There were other times when she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>) would come to a sudden check in this tone and in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>) many tones, and would seem to pity me. ''
<p/>Pip, Pip,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>) said one evening, coming to such a check, when we sat apart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond; <div class="bookquote">``will you never take warning?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>relation,--if She (<font color='blue'><b>Brandley</b></font>) had admirers without end. '' Of what? '' <div class="bookquote">``Of me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Warning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Estella?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind, but for the reason that I always was restrained--and this was not the least of my miseries--by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) could not choose but obey Miss Havisham.
<p/>My dread always was, that this knowledge on her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) part laid me under a heavy disadvantage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) pride, and made me the subject of a rebellious struggle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) bosom.
<p/>At any rate,'' said I, ``I have no warning given me just now, for you wrote to me to come to you, this time.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do I mean! If you don't know what I mean, you are blind. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' That's true,'' said Estella, with a cold careless smile that always chilled me.
<p/>After looking at the twilight without, for a little while, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) went on to say:-- '' The time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a day at Satis.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would rather I did not travel alone, and objects to receiving my maid, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people.
<p/>You are to take me there, and bring me back, if you will. Can you take me?'' <div class="bookquote">``Can I take you, Estella!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You can then? The day after to-morrow, if you please. You are to pay all charges out of my purse, You hear the condition of your going?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And must obey,'' said I. This was all the preparation I received for that visit, or for others like it; Miss Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much as seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) handwriting.
<p/>We went down on the next day but one, and we found her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) in the room where I had first beheld her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), and it is needless to add that there was no change in Satis House.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had been when I last saw them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there was something positively dreadful in the energy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looks and embraces.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hung upon Estella's beauty, hung upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) words, hung upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) gestures, and sat mumbling her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) own trembling fingers while she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) were devouring the beautiful creature she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had reared.
<p/>From Estella she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed to pry into my heart and probe its wounds.
<p/>'' '' How does she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) use you, Pip; how does she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) use you? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) asked me again, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) witch-like eagerness, even in Estella's hearing.
<p/>But, when we sat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) flickering fire at night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was most weird; for then, keeping Estella's hand drawn through her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) arm and clutched in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) own hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) extorted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), by dint of referring back to what Estella had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) regular letters, the names and conditions of the men whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had fascinated; and as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a mind mortally hurt and diseased, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) other hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) crutch stick, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) chin on that, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) wan bright eyes glaring at me, a very spectre.
<p/>I saw in this, wretched though it made me, and bitter the sense of dependence and even of degradation that it awakened,--I saw in this that Estella was set to wreak Miss Havisham's revenge on men, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was not to be given to me until she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had gratified it for a term.
<p/>Sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) out to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) with the malicious assurance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was beyond the reach of all admirers, and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose.
<p/>I saw in this that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even while the prize was reserved for me.
<p/>I saw in this the reason for my being staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian's declining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme.
<p/>I saw in this, a reason for her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) being beforehand assigned to me. In a word, I saw in this Miss Havisham as I had her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) then
<p/>and there before my eyes, and always had had her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) before my eyes; and I saw in this, the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) life was hidden from the sun.
<p/>They were high from the ground, and they burnt with the steady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed.
<p/>As I looked round at them, and at the pale gloom they made, and at the stopped clock, and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the table and the ground, and at her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) own awful figure with its ghostly reflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall, I saw in everything the construction that my mind had come to, repeated and thrown back to me.
<p/>My thoughts passed into the great room across the landing where the table was spread, and I saw it written, as it were, in the falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece, in the crawlings of the spiders on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice as they betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels, and in the gropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor.
<p/>The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on the wall. It happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose between Estella and Miss Havisham.
<p/>We were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Miss Havisham still had Estella's arm drawn through her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) own, and still clutched Estella's hand in hers, when Estella gradually began to detach herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had shown a proud impatience more than once before, and had rather endured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it.
<p/>It was the first time I had ever seen them opposed. <div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham, flashing her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``are you tired of me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Only a little tired of myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>replied Estella, disengaging her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) arm, and moving to the great chimney-piece, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) stood looking down at the fire.
<p/>'' Speak the truth, you ingrate!'' cried Miss Havisham, passionately striking her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stick upon the floor; <div class="bookquote">``you are tired of me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>Estella looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) with perfect composure, and again looked down at the fire. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) graceful figure and her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) beautiful face expressed a self-possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other
<p/>'' said Estella, preserving her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) attitude of indifference as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) leaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) eyes; <div class="bookquote">``do you reproach me for being cold?
<p/>, that was almost cruel. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>You stock and stone! '' exclaimed Miss Havisham. '' You cold, cold heart!'' <div class="bookquote">``What? You?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you not? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the fierce retort. '' You should know,'' said Estella. '' I am what you have made me.
<p/>Take all the praise, take all the blame; take all the success, take all the failure; in short, take me.'' <div class="bookquote">``O, look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Havisham, bitterly;
<p/>Where I took her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its stabs, and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``At least I was no party to the compact,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, ``for if I could walk and speak, when it was made, it was as much as I could do.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) so hard and thankless, on the hearth where she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was reared! But what would you have? You have been very good to me, and I owe everything to you.
<p/>What would you have?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Love,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the other. '' You have it. '' '' I have not,'' said Miss Havisham. ''
<p/>Mother by adoption,'' retorted Estella, never departing from the easy grace of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) attitude, never raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) voice as the other did, never yielding either to anger or tenderness,--<div class="bookquote">``mother by adoption, I have said that I owe everything to you.
<p/>All I possess is freely yours. All that you have given me, is at your command to have again. Beyond that, I have nothing.
<p/>And if you ask me to give you, what you never gave me, my gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities.''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Did I never give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a burning love, inseparable from jealousy at all times, and from sharp pain, while she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) speaks thus to me!
<p/>Did I never give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) love!'' cried Miss Havisham, turning wildly to me. '' Let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) call me mad, let her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) call me mad!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why should I call you mad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>returned Estella, <div class="bookquote">``I, of all people? Does any one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I do?
<p/>I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool that is even now beside you there, learning your lessons and looking up into your face, when your face was strange and frightened me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/>Does any one live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half as well as I do? <div class="bookquote">``Soon forgotten!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>moaned Miss Havisham.
<p/>'' Times soon forgotten!'' '' No, not forgotten,'' retorted Estella,--<div class="bookquote">``not forgotten, but treasured up in my memory. When have you found me false to your teaching?
<p/>When have you found me unmindful of your lessons? When have you found me giving admission here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) bosom with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``to anything that you excluded?
<p/>Be just to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So proud, so proud! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>moaned Miss Havisham, pushing away her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) gray hair with both her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) hands.
<p/>'' Who taught me to be proud? '' returned Estella. '' Who praised me when I learnt my lesson?'' <div class="bookquote">``So hard, so hard!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>moaned Miss Havisham, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) former action. '' Who taught me to be hard? '' returned Estella. '' Who praised me when I learnt my lesson?''
<p/>'' But to be proud and hard to me! '' Miss Havisham quite shrieked, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) arms. ''
<p/>Estella looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but was not otherwise disturbed; when the moment was past, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looked down at the fire again.
<p/>I cannot think,'' said Estella, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) eyes after a silence <div class="bookquote">``why you should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a separation.
<p/>Estella, Estella, Estella, to be proud and hard to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>'' I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes. I have never been unfaithful to you or your schooling.
<p/>I have never shown any weakness that I can charge myself with.'' <div class="bookquote">``Would it be weakness to return my love?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Miss Havisham.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I begin to think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella, in a musing way, after another moment of calm wonder, <div class="bookquote">``that I almost understand how this comes about.
<p/>If you had brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of these rooms, and had never let her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) know that there was such a thing as the daylight by which she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had never once seen your face,--if
<p/>you had done that, and then, for a purpose had wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to understand the daylight and know all about it, you would have been disappointed and angry?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>Miss Havisham, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) head in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) hands, sat making a low moaning, and swaying herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) chair, but gave no answer.
<p/>Or,'' said Estella,--<div class="bookquote">``which is a nearer case,--if you had taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), from the dawn of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) intelligence, with your utmost energy and might, that there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) enemy and destroyer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) must always turn against it, for it had blighted you and would else blight her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>);--if you had done this, and then, for a purpose, had wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) to take naturally to the daylight and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) could not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>But yes, yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) would call it so!'' '' '' Miss Havisham sat listening -LRB-or it seemed so, for I could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) face-RRB-, but still made no answer.
<p/>'' So,'' said Estella, <div class="bookquote">``I must be taken as I have been made. The success is not mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me.
<p/>Miss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor, among the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn.
<p/>I took advantage of the moment--I had sought one from the first--to leave the room, after beseeching Estella's attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), with a movement of my hand.
<p/>Miss Havisham's gray hair was all adrift upon the ground, among the other bridal wrecks, and was a miserable sight to see.
<p/>It was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an hour and more, about the courtyard, and about the brewery, and about the ruined garden.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>When I left, Estella was yet standing by the great chimney-piece, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had stood throughout. When I at last took courage to return to the room
<p/>, I found Estella sitting at Miss Havisham's knee, taking up some stitches in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces, and of which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old banners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals.
<p/>Afterwards, Estella and I played at cards, as of yore,--only we were skilful now, and played French games,--and so the evening wore away, and I went to bed.
<p/>It was the first time I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused to come near me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was on this side of my pillow, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot, behind the half-opened door of the dressing-room, in the dressing-room, in the room overhead, in the room beneath,--everywhere.
<p/>At last, when the night was slow to creep on towards two o'clock, I felt that I absolutely could no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in, and that I must get up.
<p/>I therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went out across the yard into the long stone passage, designing to gain the outer courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind.
<p/>But I was no sooner in the passage than I extinguished my candle; for I saw Miss Havisham going along it in a ghostly manner, making a low cry.
<p/>I lay in that separate building across the courtyard. A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me. I followed her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) at a distance, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) go up the staircase.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) carried a bare candle in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand, which she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had probably taken from one of the sconces in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own room, and was a most unearthly object by its light.
<p/>Standing at the bottom of the staircase, I felt the mildewed air of the feast-chamber, without seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) open the door, and I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) walking there, and so across into her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own room, and so across again into that, never ceasing the low cry.
<p/>After a time, I tried in the dark both to get out, and to go back, but I could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands.
<p/>During the whole interval, whenever I went to the bottom of the staircase, I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) footstep, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) light pass above, and heard her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ceaseless low cry.
<p/>Before we left next day, there was no revival of the difference between her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and Estella, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion; and there were four similar occasions, to the best of my remembrance.
<p/>Nor, did Miss Havisham's manner towards Estella in anywise change, except that I believed it to have something like fear infused among its former characteristics.
<p/>It is impossible to turn this leaf of my life, without putting Bentley Drummle's name upon it; or I would, very gladly.
<p/>On a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force, and when good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody's agreeing with anybody else, the presiding Finch called the Grove to order, forasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a lady; which, according to the solemn constitution of the society, it was the brute's turn to do that day.
<p/>I thought I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) leer in an ugly way at me while the decanters were going round, but as there was no love lost between us, that might easily be.
<p/>What was my indignant surprise when he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) called upon the company to pledge him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) to <div class="bookquote">``Estella!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' Estella who?'' said I.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never you mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>retorted Drummle. '' Estella of where?'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``You are bound to say of where. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>Which he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) was, as a Finch.
<p/>'' Of Richmond, gentlemen,'' said Drummle, putting me out of the question, <div class="bookquote">``and a peerless beauty. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Much he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) knew about peerless beauties, a mean, miserable idiot!
<p/>I whispered Herbert. '' I know that lady,'' said Herbert, across the table, when the toast had been honored. <div class="bookquote">``Do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Mr. Drummle</b></font>)</div>said Drummle.
<p/>This was the only retort--except glass or crockery--that the heavy creature was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by it as if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place and said that I could not but regard it as being like the honorable Finch's impudence to come down to that Grove,--we always talked about coming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of expression,--down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Grove</b></font>) knew nothing.
<p/>'' And so do I,'' I added, with a scarlet face. '' Do you?'' said Drummle. '' O, Lord!'' Mr. Drummle, upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant by that?
<p/>Whether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood, after this, was a question on which the Finches were divided.
<p/>The debate upon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six more honorable members told six more, during the discussion, that they believed they knew where they were to be found.
<p/>However, it was decided at last -LRB-the Grove being a Court of Honor-RRB- that if Mr. Drummle would bring never so slight a certificate from the lady, importing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) had the honor of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) acquaintance, Mr. Pip must express his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) regret, as a gentleman and a Finch, for ``having been betrayed into a warmth which.
<p/>Next day was appointed for the production -LRB-lest our honor should take cold from delay-RRB-, and next day Drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in Estella's hand, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had had the honor of dancing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>) several times.
<p/>This left me no course but to regret that I had been <div class="bookquote">``betrayed into a warmth which,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and on the whole to repudiate, as untenable, the idea that I was to be found anywhere.
<p/>Drummle and I then sat snorting at one another for an hour, while the Grove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction, and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing rate.
<p/>Whereupon I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>) the extreme reply that I believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Finch</b></font>) knew where I was to be found. '' I tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me.
<p/>For, I cannot adequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should show any favor to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very far below the average.
<p/>To the present moment, I believe it to have been referable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my love for her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), that I could not endure the thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) stooping to that hound.
<p/>No doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had favored; but a worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of distress.
<p/>It was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that Drummle had begun to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) closely, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) to do it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) held on, in a dull persistent way, and Estella held him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) on; now with encouragement, now with discouragement, now almost flattering him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>), now openly despising him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>), now knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) very well, now scarcely remembering who he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) was.
<p/>The Spider, as Mr. Jaggers had called him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), was used to lying in wait, however, and had the patience of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) tribe.
<p/>Added to that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had a blockhead confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) money and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) family greatness, which sometimes did him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) good service,--almost taking the place of concentration and determined purpose.
<p/>So, the Spider, doggedly watching Estella, outwatched many brighter insects, and would often uncoil himself and drop at the right nick of time.
<p/>At a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond -LRB-there used to be Assembly Balls at most places then-RRB-, where Estella had outshone all other beauties, this blundering Drummle so hung about her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), and with so much toleration on her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) part, that I resolved to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) concerning him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>).
<p/>I took the next opportunity; which was when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was waiting for Mrs. Blandley to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go.
<p/>A little while, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) was always in pursuit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) and I crossed one another every day. I was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), for I almost always accompanied them to and from such places.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Say rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House to write, before I go to sleep.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Are you tired, Estella?'' <div class="bookquote">``Rather, Pip.

'' What is there in that fellow in the corner yonder,--to use your words,--that I need look at?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, that is the very question I want to ask you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``For he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has been hovering about you all night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Moths, and all sorts of ugly creatures,'' replied Estella, with a glance towards him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``hover about a lighted candle. Can the candle help it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No,'' I returned; <div class="bookquote">``but cannot the Estella help it?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), laughing, after a moment, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps. Yes. Anything you like.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But, Estella, do hear me speak. It makes me wretched that you should encourage a man so generally despised as Drummle.
<p/>You know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is despised. '' <div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>). '' You know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is as ungainly within as without. A deficient, ill-tempered, lowering, stupid fellow.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>). '' You know he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has nothing to recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) but money and a ridiculous roll of addle-headed predecessors; now, don't you?''
<p/>To overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), and said, repeating it with emphasis, ``Well!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) again; and each time she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) lovely eyes the wider. Then, that is why it makes me wretched.
<p/>Now, if I could have believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) favored Drummle with any idea of making me-me--wretched, I should have been in better heart about it; but in that habitual way of hers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) put me so entirely out of the question, that I could believe nothing of the kind.

<p/>There is no doubt you do,'' said I, something hurriedly, ``for I have seen you give him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looks and smiles this very night, such as you never give to--me.

<p/>* And now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled my heart, and so often made it ache and ache again, I pass on unhindered, to the event that had impended over me longer yet; the event that had begun to be prepared for, before I knew that the world held Estella, and in the days when her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) baby intelligence was receiving its first distortions from Miss Havisham's wasting hands.
<p/>In the Eastern story, the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of state in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry, the tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried through the leagues of rock, the slab was slowly raised and fitted in the roof, the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of hollow to the great iron ring.
<p/>All being made ready with much labor, and the hour come, the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night, and the sharpened axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring was put into his (<font color='blue'><b>sultan</b></font>) hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>sultan</b></font>) struck with it, and the rope parted and rushed away, and the ceiling fell.
<p/>So, in my case; all the work, near and afar, that tended to the end, had been accomplished; and in an instant the blow was struck, and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon me.
<p/>Not another word had I heard to enlighten me on the subject of my expectations, and my twenty-third birthday was a week gone.
<p/>I'll say no more. '' * Chapter XXXIX I was three-and-twenty years of age. We had left Barnard's Inn more than a year, and lived in the Temple.
<p/>Mr. Pocket and I had for some time parted company as to our original relations, though we continued on the best terms.
<p/>I hope arose out of the restless and incomplete tenure on which I held my means,--I had a taste for reading, and read regularly so many hours a day.
<p/>That matter of Herbert's was still progressing, and everything with me was as I have brought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter.
<p/>Our chambers were in Garden-court, down by the river. Notwithstanding my inability to settle to anything,--which Business had taken Herbert on a journey to Marseilles.
<p/>Dispirited and anxious, long hoping that to-morrow or next week would clear my way, and long disappointed, I sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend.
<p/>I was alone, and had a dull sense of being alone. It was wretched weather; stormy and wet, stormy and wet; and mud, mud, mud, deep in all the streets.
<p/>Day after day, a vast heavy veil had been driving over London from the East, and it drove still, as if in the East there were an Eternity of cloud and wind.
<p/>So furious had been the gusts, that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs; and in the country, trees had been torn up, and sails of windmills carried away; and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast, of shipwreck and death.
<p/>Violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages of wind, and the day just closed as I sat down to read had been the worst of all.
<p/>Alterations have been made in that part of the Temple since that time, and it has not now so lonely a character as it had then, nor is it so exposed to the river.
<p/>We lived at the top of the last house, and the wind rushing up the river shook the house that night, like discharges of cannon, or breakings of a sea.
<p/>When the rain came with it and dashed against the windows, I thought, raising my eyes to them as they rocked, that I might have fancied myself in a storm-beaten lighthouse.
<p/>Occasionally, the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it could not bear to go out into such a night; and when I set the doors open and looked down the staircase, the staircase lamps were blown out; and when I shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black windows -LRB-opening them ever so little was out of the question in the teeth of such wind and rain-RRB-
<p/>, I saw that the lamps in the court were blown out, and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were shuddering, and that the coal-fires in barges on the river were being carried away before the wind like red-hot splashes in the rain.
<p/>As I shut it, Saint Paul's, and all the many church-clocks in the City--some leading, some accompanying, some following--struck that hour.
<p/>The sound was curiously flawed by the wind; and I was listening, and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it, when I heard a footstep on the stair.
<p/>I read with my watch upon the table, purposing to close my book at eleven o'clock. What nervous folly made me start, and awfully connect it with the footstep of my dead sister, matters not.
<p/>It was past in a moment, and I listened again, and heard the footstep stumble in coming on. Remembering then, that the staircase-lights were blown out, I took up my reading-lamp and went out to the stair-head.
<p/>Whoever was below had stopped on seeing my lamp, for all was quiet. '' There is some one down there, is there not?
<p/>'' I called out, looking down. '' Yes,'' said a voice from the darkness beneath. '' What floor do you want?''
<p/>'' The top. Mr. Pip. '' '' That is my name.--There is nothing the matter?'' '' Nothing the matter,'' returned the voice.
<p/>And the man came on. I stood with my lamp held out over the stair-rail, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came slowly within its light.
<p/>It was a shaded lamp, to shine upon a book, and its circle of light was very contracted; so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in it for a mere instant, and then out of it.
<p/>In the instant, I had seen a face that was strange to me, looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched and pleased by the sight of me.
<p/>Moving the lamp as the man moved, I made out that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was substantially dressed, but roughly, like a voyager by sea.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a muscular man, strong on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was browned and hardened by exposure to weather.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ascended the last stair or two, and the light of my lamp included us both, I saw, with a stupid kind of amazement, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was holding out both his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands to me.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had long iron-gray hair. That his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) age was about sixty. '' Pray what is your business? '' I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' My business? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) repeated, pausing. '' Ah! Yes. I will explain my business, by your leave.'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you wish to come in?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the question inhospitably enough, for I resented the sort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face.
<p/>'' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``I wish to come in, master. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I resented it, because it seemed to imply that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expected me to respond to it.
<p/>But I took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into the room I had just left, and, having set the lamp on the table, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as civilly as I could to explain himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with the strangest air,--an air of wondering pleasure, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had some part in the things
<p/>Then, I saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head was furrowed and bald, and that the long iron-gray hair grew only on its sides.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) admired,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pulled off a rough outer coat, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat. But, I saw nothing that in the least explained him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>On the contrary, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) next moment, once more holding out both his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands to me. '' What do you mean?
<p/>'' said I, half suspecting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be mad. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looking at me, and slowly rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head.
<p/>It's disapinting to a man,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, in a coarse broken voice, <div class="bookquote">``arter having looked for`ard so distant, and come so fur; but you're not to blame for that,--neither on us is to blame for that.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat down on a chair that stood before the fire, and covered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) large brown veinous hands.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I'll speak in half a minute. Give me half a minute, please. '' I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attentively then, and recoiled a little from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but I did not know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' There's no one nigh,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder; <div class="bookquote">``is there?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night, ask that question?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You're a game one,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) returned, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) head at me with a deliberate affection, at once most unintelligible and most exasperating; <div class="bookquote">``I'm glad you've grow'd up, a game one!
<p/>But don't catch hold of me. You'd be sorry arterwards to have done it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I relinquished the intention he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had detected, for I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)!
<p/>If the wind and the rain had driven away the intervening years, had scattered all the intervening objects, had swept us to the churchyard where we first stood face to face on such different levels, I could not have known my convict more distinctly than I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) now as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) sat in the chair before the fire.
<p/>No need to take a file from his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) pocket and show it to me; no need to take the handkerchief from his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) neck and twist it round his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) head; no need to hug himself with both his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) arms, and take a shivering turn across the room, looking back at me for recognition.
<p/>Even yet I could not recall a single feature, but I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)! I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) gave me one of those aids, though, a moment before
<p/>, I had not been conscious of remotely suspecting his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) identity. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) came back to where I stood, and again held out both his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Not knowing what to do,--for, in my astonishment I had lost my self-possession,--I reluctantly gave him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) my hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) grasped them heartily, raised them to his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) lips, kissed them, and still held them.
<p/>At a change in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) manner as if he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) were even going to embrace me, I laid a hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) breast and put him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) away.
<p/>'' You acted noble, my boy,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>). '' Noble, Pip! And I have never forgot it!'' <div class="bookquote">``Stay!''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Keep off!
<p/>If you are grateful to me for what I did when I was a little child, I hope you have shown your gratitude by mending your way of life.
<p/>Still, however you have found me out, there must be something good in the feeling that has brought you here, and I will not repulse you; but surely you must understand that--I--
<p/>My attention was so attracted by the singularity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) fixed look at me, that the words died away on my tongue.
<p/>If you have come here to thank me, it was not necessary. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>'' You was a saying,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) observed, when we had confronted one another in silence, <div class="bookquote">``that surely I must understand.

<p/>But our ways are different ways, none the less. You are wet, and you look weary. Will you drink something before you go?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had replaced his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) neckerchief loosely, and had stood, keenly observant of me, biting a long end of it. ''
<p/>I think,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) answered, still with the end at his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mouth and still observant of me, <div class="bookquote">``that I will drink -LRB-I thank you-RRB-
<p/>afore I go. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>There was a tray ready on a side-table. I brought it to the table near the fire, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) would have?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) touched one of the bottles without looking at it or speaking, and I made him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) some hot rum and water.
<p/>I tried to keep my hand steady while I did so, but his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) look at me as he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) chair with the long draggled end of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) neckerchief between his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) teeth--evidently forgotten--made my hand very difficult to master.
<p/>When at last I put the glass to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), I saw with amazement that his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) eyes were full of tears. Up to this time I had remained standing, not to disguise that I wished him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) gone.
<p/>I hope,'' said I, hurriedly putting something into a glass for myself, and drawing a chair to the table, <div class="bookquote">``that you will not think I spoke harshly to you just now.
<p/>But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man, and felt a touch of reproach. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had no intention of doing it, and I am sorry for it if I did.
<p/>As I put my glass to my lips, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glanced with surprise at the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neckerchief, dropping from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opened it, and stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.
<p/>I wish you well and happy!'' I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mine, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drank, and drew his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleeve across his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes and forehead.

<p/>Without stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which they were spoken, I turned off to a point that had just come into my mind.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a messenger</b></font>)</div>'' Have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me,'' I inquired, <div class="bookquote">``since he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) undertook that trust?''

<p/>But, like you, I have done well since, and you must let me pay them back. You can put them to some other poor boy's use.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) watched me as I laid my purse upon the table and opened it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) watched me as I separated two one-pound notes from its contents.
<p/>'' I took out my purse. They were clean and new, and I spread them out and handed them over to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>Still watching me, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) laid them one upon the other, folded them long-wise, gave them a twist, set fire to them at the lamp, and dropped the ashes into the tray.
<p/>May I make so bold,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said then, with a smile that was like a frown, and with a frown that was like a smile, <div class="bookquote">``as ask you how you have done well, since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes?''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) put a foot up to the bars, to dry and warm it, and the wet boot began to steam; but, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) neither looked at it, nor at the fire, but steadily looked at me.
<p/>When my lips had parted, and had shaped some words that were without sound, I forced myself to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) -LRB-though I could not do it distinctly-RRB-, that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) caught me, drew me to the sofa, put me up against the cushions, and bent on one knee before me, bringing the face that I now well remembered, and that I shuddered at, very near to mine.
<p/>'' Yes, Pip, dear boy, I've made a gentleman on you! It's me wot has done it! I swore that time, sure as ever I earned a guinea, that guinea should go to you.

(<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) went on, taking my watch out of my pocket, and turning towards him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) a ring on my finger, while I recoiled from his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) touch as if he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had been a snake, <div class="bookquote">``a gold `un and a beauty: that's a gentleman's, I hope!

<p/>Not that a gentleman like you, so well set up as you, can't win 'em off of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own game; but money shall back you!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>O Estella, Estella! '' They shall be yourn, dear boy, if money can buy 'em. Let me finish wot I was a telling you, dear boy.
<p/>From that there hut and that there hiring-out, I got money left me by my master -LRB-which died, and had been the same as me-RRB-, and got my liberty and went for myself.
<p/>In every single thing I went for, I went for you. ' Lord strike a blight upon it,' I says, wotever it was I went for, `if it ain't for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)!'
<p/>It all prospered wonderful. As I giv' you to understand just now, I'm famous for it. It was the money left me, and the gains of the first few year wot
<p/>I sent home to Mr. Jaggers--all for you--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) first come arter you, agreeable to my letter. '' O that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had never come!
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had left me at the forge,--far from contented, yet, by comparison happy! '' And then, dear boy, it was a recompense to me,
<p/>The blood horses of them colonists might fling up the dust over me as I was walking; what do I say?
<p/>look`ee here, to know in secret that I was making a gentleman. I says to myself, `I'm making a better gentleman nor ever you'll be!'
<p/>When one of 'em says to another, `He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a convict, a few year ago, and is a ignorant common fellow now, for all he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s lucky,' what do I say?
<p/>I says to myself, `If I ain't a gentleman, nor yet ain't got no learning, I'm the owner of such. All on you owns stock and land; which on you owns a brought-up London gentleman?'
<p/>And this way I held steady afore my mind that I would for certain come one day and see my boy, and make myself known to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own ground.
<p/>This way I kep myself a going. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand on my shoulder. I shuddered at the thought that for anything I knew, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand might be stained with blood.
<p/>But I held to it, and the harder it was, the stronger I held, for I was determined, and my mind firm made up.
<p/>'' It warn't easy, Pip, for me to leave them parts, nor yet it warn't safe. At last I done it.
<p/>Throughout, I had seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>); even now, I could not separate his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) voice from those voices, though those were loud and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) was silent.
<p/>Dear boy, I done it! '' I tried to collect my thoughts, but I was stunned. '' Where will you put me?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) asked, presently. '' I must be put somewheres, dear boy.'' '' To sleep?'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``Yes. And to sleep long and sound,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) answered; <div class="bookquote">``for I've been sea-tossed and sea-washed, months and months.''

<p/>Because, look`ee here, dear boy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) voice, and laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner, <div class="bookquote">``caution is necessary.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>No,'' said I, answering almost mechanically, in spite of my utmost efforts; <div class="bookquote">``not to-morrow. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``How do you mean?

<p/>If I had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) instead of abhorring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); if I had been attracted to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the strongest admiration and affection, instead of shrinking from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with the strongest repugnance; it could have been no worse.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>On the contrary, it would have been better, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) preservation would then have naturally and tenderly addressed my heart.
<p/>My first care was to close the shutters, so that no light might be seen from without, and then to close and make fast the doors.
<p/>While I did so, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit; and when I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thus engaged, I saw my convict on the marshes at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meal again.
<p/>When I had gone into Herbert's room, and had shut off any other communication between it and the staircase than through the room in which our conversation had been held, I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) would go to bed?
<p/>It almost seemed to me as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) must stoop down presently, to file at his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) leg. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) said yes, but asked me for some of my <div class="bookquote">``gentleman's linen''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>to put on in the morning.
<p/>I brought it out, and laid it ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and my blood again ran cold when he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) again took me by both hands to give me good night.
<p/>I got away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), without knowing how I did it, and mended the fire in the room where we had been together, and sat down by it, afraid to go to bed.
<p/>For an hour or more, I remained too stunned to think; and it was not until I began to think, that I began fully to know how wrecked I was, and how the ship in which I had sailed was gone to pieces.
<p/>Miss Havisham's intentions towards me, all a mere dream; Estella not designed for me; I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience, a sting for the greedy relations, a model with a mechanical heart to practise on when no other practice was at hand; those were the first smarts I had.
<p/>knew not what crimes, and liable to be taken out of those rooms where I sat thinking, and hanged at the Old Bailey door, that I had deserted Joe.
<p/>I would not have gone back to Joe now, I would not have gone back to Biddy now, for any consideration; simply, I suppose, because my sense of my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration.
<p/>No wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that I should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity; but I could never, never, undo what I had done.
<p/>But, sharpest and deepest pain of all,--it was for the convict, guilty of I In every rage of wind and rush of rain, I heard pursuers.
<p/>With these fears upon me, I began either to imagine or recall that I had had mysterious warnings of this man's approach.
<p/>Twice, I could have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door. That, for weeks gone by, I had passed faces in the streets which I had thought like his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>That his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers to mine, and that now on this stormy night he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was as good as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) word, and with me.
<p/>Crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that I had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man; that I had heard that other convict reiterate that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had tried to murder him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); that I had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild beast.
<p/>Out of such remembrances I brought into the light of the fire a half-formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the dead of the wild solitary night.
<p/>This dilated until it filled the room, and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my dreadful burden.
<p/>That these likenesses had grown more numerous, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), coming over the sea, had drawn nearer. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had rolled a handkerchief round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face was set and lowering in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleep.
<p/>Assured of this, I softly removed the key to the outside of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) door, and turned it on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before I again sat down by the fire.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was asleep, and quietly too, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a pistol lying on the pillow. Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on the floor.
<p/>When I awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of my wretchedness, the clocks of the Eastward churches were striking five, the candles were wasted out, the fire was dead, and the wind and rain intensified the thick black darkness.
<p/>It was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure -LRB-so far as I could-RRB- the safety of my dreaded visitor; for, this thought pressing on me when I awoke, held other thoughts in a confused concourse at a distance.
<p/>THIS IS THE END OF THE SECOND STAGE OF PIP'S EXPECTATIONS. Chapter XL The impossibility of keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) concealed in the chambers was self-evident.
<p/>True, I had no Avenger in my service now, but I was looked after by an inflammatory old female, assisted by an animated rag-bag whom she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) niece, and to keep a room secret from them
<p/>It could not be done, and the attempt to do it would inevitably engender suspicion. would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration.
<p/>They both had weak eyes, which I had long attributed to their chronically looking in at keyholes, and they were always at hand when not wanted; indeed that was their only reliable quality besides larceny.
<p/>Not to get up a mystery with these people, I resolved to announce in the morning that my uncle had unexpectedly come from the country.
<p/>This course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darkness for the means of getting a light.
<p/>Not stumbling on the means after all, I was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there to come with his (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) lantern.
<p/>Now, in groping my way down the black staircase I fell over something, and that something was a man crouching in a corner.
<p/>As the man made no answer when I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did there, but eluded my touch in silence, I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchman to come quickly; telling him (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) of the incident on the way back.
<p/>The wind being as fierce as ever, we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase, but we examined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there.
<p/>It then occurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my rooms; so, lighting my candle at the watchman's, and leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) standing at the door, I examined them carefully, including the room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep.
<p/>It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs, on that night of all nights in the year, and I asked the watchman, on the chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) a dram at the door, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) had admitted at his (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) gate any gentleman who had perceptibly been dining out?
<p/>All was quiet, and assuredly no other man was in those chambers. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said; at different times of the night, three.
<p/>One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two lived in the Lane, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen them all go home.
<p/>Again, the only other man who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in the country for some weeks, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) certainly had not returned in the night, because we had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) door with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seal on it as we came upstairs.
<p/>The night being so bad, sir,'' said the watchman, as he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) gave me back my glass, <div class="bookquote">``uncommon few have come in at my gate.
<p/>Besides them three gentlemen that I have named, I don't call to mind another since about eleven o'clock, when a stranger asked for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' My uncle,'' I muttered. '' Yes.'' <div class="bookquote">``You saw him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. Oh yes.'' '' Likewise the person with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)?''
<p/>The person stopped, when he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) stopped to make inquiry of me, and the person took this way when he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) took this way.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Person with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeated. '' I judged the person to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>),'' returned the watchman. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``What sort of person?
<p/>The watchman had not particularly noticed; he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) should say a working person; to the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) belief, he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) had a dust-colored kind of clothes on, under a dark coat.
<p/>The watchman made more light of the matter than I did, and naturally; not having my reason for attaching weight to it.
<p/>When I had got rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>), which I thought it well to do without prolonging explanations, my mind was much troubled by these two circumstances taken together.
<p/>Whereas they were easy of innocent solution apart,--as, for instance, some diner out or diner at home, who had not gone near this watchman's gate, might have strayed to my staircase and dropped asleep
<p/>there,--and my nameless visitor might have brought some one with him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) to show him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) the way,--still, joined, they had an ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a few hours had made me.
<p/>I lighted my fire, which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the morning, and fell into a doze before it.
<p/>As there was full an hour and a half between me and daylight, I dozed again; now, waking up uneasily, with prolix conversations about nothing, in my ears; now, making thunder of the wind in the chimney; at length, falling off into a profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I seemed to have been dozing a whole night when the clocks struck six. All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation, nor could I do so yet.
<p/>I had not the power to attend to it. I was greatly dejected and distressed, but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way.
<p/>When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild morning, all of a leaden hue; when I walked from room to room; when I sat down again shivering, before the fire, waiting for my laundress to appear; I thought how miserable I was, but hardly knew why, or how long I had been so, or on what day of the week I made the reflection, or even who I was that made it.
<p/>At last, the old woman and the niece came in,--the latter with a head not easily distinguishable from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dusty broom,--and testified surprise at sight of me and the fire.
<p/>To whom I imparted how my uncle had come in the night and was then asleep, and how the breakfast preparations were to be modified accordingly.
<p/>Then I washed and dressed while they knocked the furniture about and made a dust; and so, in a sort of dream or sleep-waking, I found myself sitting by the fire again, waiting for--
<p/>As to forming any plan for the future, I could as soon have formed an elephant. Him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)--to come to breakfast. By and by, his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) door opened and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) came out.
<p/>I could not bring myself to bear the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), and I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had a worse look by daylight.
<p/>I do not even know,'' said I, speaking low as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) seat at the table, <div class="bookquote">``by what name to call you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I have given out that you are my uncle.'' '' That's it, dear boy! Call me uncle.'' <div class="bookquote">``You assumed some name, I suppose, on board ship?''
 (<font color='red'><b>boy</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes, dear boy. I took the name of Provis. '' <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean to keep that name?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, yes, dear boy, it's as good as another,--unless
<p/>you'd like another. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What is your real name? '' I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in a whisper. '' Magwitch,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) answered, in the same tone; <div class="bookquote">``chrisen'd Abel.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' What were you brought up to be?'' '' A warmint, dear boy. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) answered quite seriously, and used the word as if it denoted some profession.
<p/>When you came into the Temple last night--'' said I, pausing to wonder whether that could really have been last night, which seemed so long ago.
<p/>'' '' Yes, dear boy?'' <div class="bookquote">``When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had you any one with you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With me? No, dear boy.

<p/>But I think there was a person, too, come in alonger me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you known in London?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hope not!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), giving his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) neck a jerk with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) forefinger that made me turn hot and sick.
<p/>'' Were you known in London, once?'' <div class="bookquote">``Not over and above, dear boy. I was in the provinces mostly. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Were you--tried--in London?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Which time?'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), with a sharp look. '' The last time. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nodded. '' First knowed Mr. Jaggers that way.
<p/>It was on my lips to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was tried for, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) took up a knife, gave it a flourish, and with the words,
<p/>Jaggers was for me. '' <div class="bookquote">``And what I done is worked out and paid for! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>fell to at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) breakfast.
<p/>Some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) teeth had failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) since I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) eat on the marshes, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) food in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) mouth, and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head sideways to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) strongest fangs to bear upon it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) looked terribly like a hungry old dog.
<p/>If I had begun with any appetite, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) would have taken it away, and I should have sat much as I did,--repelled from him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) by an insurmountable aversion, and gloomily looking at the cloth.
<p/>I'm a heavy grubber, dear boy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, as a polite kind of apology when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) made an end of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) meal, <div class="bookquote">``but I always was.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) actions were uncouth, noisy, and greedy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>If it had been in my constitution to be a lighter grubber, I might ha' got into lighter trouble.
<p/>Similarly, I must have my smoke. When I was first hired out as shepherd t`other side the world, it's my belief
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) said so, he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) got up from table, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) hand into the breast of the pea-coat he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) wore, brought out a short black pipe, and a handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negro-head.
<p/>I should ha' turned into a molloncolly-mad sheep myself, if I hadn't a had my smoke. '' Having filled his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) pipe, he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) put the surplus tobacco back again, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) pocket were a drawer.
<p/>Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) took a live coal from the fire with the tongs, and lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) pipe at it, and then turned round on the hearth-rug with his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) back to the fire, and went through his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) favorite action of holding out both his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) hands for mine.
<p/>And this,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>), dandling my hands up and down in his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) puffed at his (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) pipe,--<div class="bookquote">``and this is the gentleman what I made!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The real genuine One! It does me good fur to look at you, Pip. All I stip`late, is, to stand by and look at you, dear boy!
<p/>I released my hands as soon as I could, and found that I was beginning slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition.
<p/>What I was chained to, and how heavily, became intelligible to me, as I heard his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hoarse voice, and sat looking up at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) furrowed bald head with its iron gray hair at the sides.
<p/>I mustn't see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets; there mustn't be no mud on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) boots.
<p/>'' '' My gentleman must have horses, Pip! Horses to ride, and horses to drive, and horses for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) servant to ride and drive as well.
<p/>Shall colonists have their horses -LRB-and blood `uns, if you please, good Lord!-RRB- and not my London gentleman? No, no. We'll show 'em another pair of shoes than that, Pip; won't us?
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) took out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) pocket a great thick pocket-book, bursting with papers, and tossed it on the table. ''
<p/>There's something worth spending in that there book, dear boy. It's yourn. All I've got ain't mine; it's yourn. Don't you be afeerd on it.
<p/>There's more where that come from. I've come to the old country fur to see my gentleman spend his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) money like a gentleman.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wound up, looking round the room and snapping his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fingers once with a loud snap, <div class="bookquote">``blast you every one, from the judge in his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) wig, to the colonist a stirring up the dust, I'll show a better gentleman than the whole kit on you put together!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>That'll be my pleasure. My pleasure `ull be fur to see him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) do it. And blast you all! '' <div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike, ``I want to speak to you.
<p/>I want to know how you are to be kept out of danger, how long you are going to stay, what projects you have.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look`ee here, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) hand on my arm in a suddenly altered and subdued manner; <div class="bookquote">``first of all, look`ee here.
<p/>I want to know what is to be done. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I forgot myself half a minute ago. What I said was low; that's what it was; low.
<p/>Look`ee here, Pip. Look over it. I ain't a going to be low.'' <div class="bookquote">``First,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I resumed, half groaning, <div class="bookquote">``what precautions can be taken against your being recognized and seized?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, dear boy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, in the same tone as before, <div class="bookquote">``that don't go first.

<p/>Look`ee here, Pip. I was low; that's what I was; low. Look over it, dear boy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Some sense of the grimly-ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh, as I replied, <div class="bookquote">``I have looked over it.
<p/>In Heaven's name, don't harp upon it!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, but look`ee here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) persisted. '' Dear boy, I ain't come so fur, not fur to be low.
<p/>Now, go on, dear boy. You was a saying-- '' <div class="bookquote">``How are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred?''
 (<font color='red'><b>boy</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well, dear boy, the danger ain't so great. Without I was informed agen, the danger ain't so much to signify.
<p/>There's Jaggers, and there's Wemmick, and there's you. Who else is there to inform?'' <div class="bookquote">``Is there no chance person who might identify you in the street?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.
<p/>Nor yet I don't intend to advertise myself in the newspapers by the name of A.M. come back from Botany Bay; and years have rolled away, and who's to gain by it?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``there ain't many. Still, look`ee here, Pip. If the danger had been fifty times as great, I should ha' come to see you,
<p/>mind you, just the same.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' And how long do you remain?'' <div class="bookquote">``How long?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) black pipe from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) mouth, and dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) jaw as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) stared at me.
<p/>'' I'm not a going back. I've come for good. '' <div class="bookquote">``Where are you to live?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``What is to be done with you?
<p/>Dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``there's disguising wigs can be bought for money, and there's hair powder, and spectacles, and black clothes,--shorts and what not.
<p/>Where will you be safe?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Others has done it safe afore, and what others has done afore, others can do agen.
<p/>As to the where and how of living, dear boy, give me your own opinions on it. '' <div class="bookquote">``You take it smoothly now,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``but you were very serious last night, when you swore it was Death.
<p/>And so I swear it is Death,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), putting his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pipe back in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mouth, <div class="bookquote">``and Death by the rope, in the open street not fur from this, and it's serious that you should fully understand it to be so.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' What then, when that's once done? Here I am. To go back now `ud be as bad as to stand ground--worse.
<p/>As to what I dare, I'm a old bird now, as has dared all manner of traps since first he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was fledged, and I'm not afeerd to perch upon a scarecrow.
<p/>If there's Death hid inside of it, there is, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) come out, and I'll face him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and then I'll believe in him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and not afore.
<p/>Besides, Pip, I'm here, because I've meant it by you, years and years. And now let me have a look at my gentleman agen.
<p/>Once more, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of admiring proprietorship: smoking with great complacency all the while.
<p/>It appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) some quiet lodging hard by, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might take possession when Herbert returned: whom I expected in two or three days.
<p/>That the secret must be confided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity, even if I could have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) out of the question, was plain to me.
<p/>-LRB-I resolved to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) by that name-RRB-, who reserved his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) consent to Herbert's participation until he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) should have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) and formed a favorable judgment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) physiognomy.
<p/>And even then, dear boy,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pocket, ``we'll have him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) oath.
<p/>To state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be to state what I never quite established; but this I can say, that I never knew him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) put it to any other use.
<p/>The book itself had the appearance of having been stolen from some court of justice, and perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knowledge of its antecedents, combined with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own experience in that wise, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm.
<p/>On this first occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) producing it, I recalled how he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had described himself last night as always swearing to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) resolutions in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) solitude.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next discussed with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) what dress he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) should wear.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cherished an extraordinary belief in the virtues of <div class="bookquote">``shorts''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>as a disguise, and had in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) something between a dean and a dentist.
<p/>It was with considerable difficulty that I won him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) over to the assumption of a dress more like a prosperous farmer's; and we arranged that he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) should cut his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) hair close, and wear a little powder.
<p/>Lastly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had not yet been seen by the laundress or her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) niece, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was to keep himself out of their view until his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) change of dress was made.
<p/>It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions; but in my dazed, not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did not get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was to remain shut up in the chambers while I was gone, and was on no account to open the door.
<p/>There being to my knowledge a respectable lodging-house in Essex Street, the back of which looked into the Temple, and was almost within hail of my windows, I first of all repaired to that house, and was so fortunate as to secure the second floor for my uncle, Mr. Provis.
<p/>'' But it was by no means so plain to Mr. Provis '' '' I then went from shop to shop, making such purchases as were necessary to the change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) appearance.
<p/>This business transacted, I turned my face, on my own account, to Little Britain. Mr. Jaggers was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) desk, but, seeing me enter, got up immediately and stood before his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) fire.
<p/>'' Now, Pip,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``be careful.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned. For, coming along I had thought well of what I was going to say.
<p/>'' Don't commit yourself,'' said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``and don't commit any one. You understand--any one. Don't tell me anything: I don't want to know anything; I am not curious.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>Of course I saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) knew the man was come. '' I merely want, Mr. Jaggers,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``to assure myself that what I have been told is true.
<p/>I have no hope of its being untrue, but at least I may verify it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Mr. Jaggers nodded. '' But did you say `told' or `informed'?
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) asked me, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head on one side, and not looking at me, but looking in a listening way at the floor.
<p/>'' '' Told would seem to imply verbal communication. You can't have verbal communication with a man in New South Wales, you know.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I will say, informed, Mr. Jaggers.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) is the benefactor so long unknown to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>That the man</b></font>)</div><p/>'' That is the man,'' said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``in New South Wales. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>'' And only he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)?'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``And only he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers.
<p/>I am not so unreasonable, sir, as to think you at all responsible for my mistakes and wrong conclusions; but I always supposed it was Miss Havisham.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``As you say, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Jaggers, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) eyes upon me coolly, and taking a bite at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) forefinger, <div class="bookquote">``I am not at all responsible for that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' And yet it looked so like it, sir,'' I pleaded with a downcast heart. '' Not a particle of evidence, Pip,'' said Mr. Jaggers, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head and gathering up his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) skirts.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take nothing on its looks; take everything on evidence. There's no better rule. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have no more to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, with a sigh, after standing silent for a little while.
<p/>And Magwitch--in New South Wales--having at last disclosed himself,'' said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``you will comprehend, Pip, how rigidly throughout my communication with you, I have always adhered to the strict line of fact.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>I have verified my information, and there's an end. '' '' There has never been the least departure from the strict line of fact.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I communicated to Magwitch--in New South Wales--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) first wrote to me--from New South Wales--the caution that he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) must not expect me ever to deviate from the strict line of fact.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) letter at some distant idea he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) had of seeing you in England here.
<p/>I cautioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) that I must hear no more of that; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) was not at all likely to obtain a pardon; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) was expatriated for the term of his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) natural life; and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) presenting himself in this country would be an act of felony, rendering him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) liable to the extreme penalty of the law.
<p/>You are quite aware of that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Quite, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I also communicated to him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) another caution. I gave Magwitch that caution,'' said Mr. Jaggers, looking hard at me; ``I wrote it to New South Wales.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been informed by Wemmick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>pursued Mr. Jaggers, still looking hard at me, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) has received a letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist of the name of Purvis, or--''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Or Provis,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I suggested.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Purvis</b></font>) guided himself by it, no doubt.'' <div class="bookquote">``No doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>I. Provis</b></font>)</div>said I. '' Or Provis--thank you, Pip. Perhaps it is Provis? Perhaps you know it's Provis?''
<p/>A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist of the name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your address, on behalf of Magwitch.
<p/>'' Yes,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``You know it's Provis. Wemmick sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) the particulars, I understand, by return of post. Probably it is through Provis that you have received the explanation of Magwitch--in New South Wales?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It came through Provis,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied. '' Good day, Pip,'' said Mr. Jaggers, offering his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hand; ``glad to have seen you.
<p/>In writing by post to Magwitch--in New South Wales--or in communicating with him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) through Provis, have the goodness to mention that the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you, together with the balance; for there is still a balance remaining.
<p/>I turned at the door, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) was still looking hard at me, while the two vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open, and to force out of their swollen throats, <div class="bookquote">``O, what a man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Good day, Pip! '' We shook hands, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked hard at me as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could see me. Wemmick was out, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had been at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) desk he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) could have done nothing for me.
<p/>I went straight back to the Temple, where I found the terrible Provis drinking rum and water and smoking negro-head, in safety.
<p/>Next day the clothes I had ordered all came home, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) put them on. Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) put on, became him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) less -LRB-it dismally seemed to me-RRB- than what he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) had worn before.
<p/>The more I dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) and the better I dressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>), the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) looked like the slouching fugitive on the marshes.
<p/>This effect on my anxious fancy was partly referable, no doubt, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) old face and manner growing more familiar to me; but I believe too that he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) dragged one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) legs as if there were still a weight of iron on it, and that from head to foot there was Convict in the very grain of the man.
<p/>The influences of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) solitary hut-life were upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) besides, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a savage air that no dress could tame; added to these were the influences of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) subsequent branded life among men, and, crowning all, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) consciousness that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was dodging and hiding now.
<p/>In all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ways of sitting and standing, and eating and drinking,--of brooding about in a high-shouldered reluctant style,--of taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) great horn-handled jackknife and wiping it on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs and cutting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) food,--of lifting light glasses and cups to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips, as if they were clumsy pannikins,--of chopping a wedge off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bread, and soaking up with it the last fragments of gravy round and round his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plate, as if to make the most of an allowance, and then drying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger-ends on it, and then swallowing it,--in these ways and a thousand other small nameless instances arising every minute in the day
<p/>To my thinking, there was something in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that made it hopeless to attempt to disguise him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). , there was Prisoner, Felon, Bondsman, plain as plain could be.
<p/>It had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) own idea to wear that touch of powder, and I had conceded the powder after overcoming the shorts.
<p/>But I can compare the effect of it, when on, to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon the dead; so awful was the manner in which everything in him (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) that it was most desirable to repress, started through that thin layer of pretence, and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) head.
<p/>Words cannot tell what a sense I had, at the same time, of the dreadful mystery that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) was to me.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) fell asleep of an evening, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) knotted hands clenching the sides of the easy-chair, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) bald head tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) breast, I would sit and look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>), wondering what he (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) had done, and loading him (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) with all the crimes in the Calendar, until the impulse was powerful on me to start up and fly from him (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>).
<p/>Every hour so increased my abhorrence of him (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>), that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in the first agonies of being so haunted, notwithstanding all he (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) had done for me and the risk he (<font color='blue'><b>Prisoner</b></font>) ran, but for the knowledge that Herbert must soon come back.
<p/>Once, I actually did start out of bed in the night, and begin to dress myself in my worst clothes, hurriedly intending to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) there with everything else I possessed, and enlist for India as a private soldier.
<p/>I doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me, up in those lonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights, with the wind and the rain always rushing by.
<p/>A ghost could not have been taken and hanged on my account, and the consideration that he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) could be, and the dread that he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) would be, were no small addition to my horrors.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) was not asleep, or playing a complicated kind of Patience with a ragged pack of cards of his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) own,--a game that I never saw before or since, and in which he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) recorded his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) winnings by sticking his (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) jackknife into the table,--when he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) was not engaged in either of these pursuits, he (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>) would ask me to read to him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>),--<div class="bookquote">``Foreign language, dear boy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>While I complied, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), not comprehending a single word, would stand before the fire surveying me with the air of an Exhibitor, and I would see him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), between the fingers of the hand with which I shaded my face, appealing in dumb show to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency.
<p/>The imaginary student pursued by the misshapen creature he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) had impiously made, was not more wretched than I, pursued by the creature who had made me, and recoiling from him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) with a stronger repulsion, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) admired me and the fonder he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) was of me.
<p/>It was abandoned as soon as tried, and he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) wore his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) grizzled hair cut short. This is written of, I am sensible, as if it had lasted a year.
<p/>It lasted about five days. Expecting Herbert all the time, I dared not go out, except when I took Provis for an airing after dark.
<p/>At length, one evening when dinner was over and I had dropped into a slumber quite worn out,--for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful dreams,--I was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase.
<p/>Provis, who had been asleep too, staggered up at the noise I made, and in an instant I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) jackknife shining in his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Quiet! It's Herbert! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said; and Herbert came bursting in, with the airy freshness of six hundred miles of France upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).
<p/>'' Handel, my dear fellow, how are you, and again how are you, and again how are you? I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth!
<p/>Why, so I must have been, for you have grown quite thin and pale! Handel, my--Halloa! I beg your pardon. ''
<p/>Provis, regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) with a fixed attention, was slowly putting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) jackknife, and groping in another pocket for something else.
<p/>Herbert, my dear friend,'' said I, shutting the double doors, while Herbert stood staring and wondering, <div class="bookquote">``something very strange has happened.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was stopped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) running on and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) shaking hands with me, by seeing Provis. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>This is--a visitor of mine.''
<p/>It's all right, dear boy!'' said Provis coming forward, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) little clasped black book, and then addressing himself to Herbert.
<p/>'' ``Take it in your right hand. Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever you split in any way sumever!
<p/>So, Herbert, looking at me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provis immediately shaking hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>), said, <div class="bookquote">``Now you're on your oath, you know.
<p/>Kiss it!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do so, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) wishes it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said to Herbert. And never believe me on mine, if Pip shan't make a gentleman on you!''
<p/>In vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet of Herbert, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) and I and Provis sat down before the fire, and I recounted the whole of the secret.
<p/>Enough, that I saw my own feelings reflected in Herbert's face, and not least among them, my repugnance towards the man who had done so much for me.
<p/>What would alone have set a division between that man and us, if there had been no other dividing circumstance, was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) triumph in my story.
<p/>Saving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) troublesome sense of having been <div class="bookquote">``low''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>on one occasion since his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) return,--on which point he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to hold forth to Herbert, the moment my revelation was finished,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had no perception of the possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) boast that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had made me a gentleman, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had come to see me support the character on his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) ample resources, was made for me quite as much as for himself.
<p/>And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us, and that we must both be very proud of it
<p/>Though, look`ee here, Pip's comrade,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) said to Herbert, after having discoursed for some time, <div class="bookquote">``I know very well that once since I come back--for half a minute--I've been low.
<p/>Chapter XLI , was a conclusion quite established in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) own mind. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>I said to Pip, I knowed as I had been low.
<p/>I ain't made Pip a gentleman, and Pip ain't a going to make you a gentleman, not fur me not to know what's due to ye both.
<p/>But don't you fret yourself on that score. Dear boy, and Pip's comrade, you two may count upon me always having a gen-teel muzzle on.
<p/>Muzzled I have been since that half a minute when I was betrayed into lowness, muzzled I am at the present time, muzzled I ever will be.
<p/>We were anxious for the time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) would go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) lodging and leave us together, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) was evidently jealous of leaving us together, and sat late.
<p/>It was midnight before I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) round to Essex Street, and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) safely in at his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) own dark door.
<p/>When it closed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), I experienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) arrival.
<p/>Never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs, I had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark, and in bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) back; and I looked about me now.
<p/>Difficult as it is in a large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched, when the mind is conscious of danger in that regard, I could not persuade myself that any of the people within sight cared about my movements.
<p/>The few who were passing passed on their several ways, and the street was empty when I turned back into the Temple.
<p/>'' Herbert said, <div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>but looked as if there were no specific consolation in this, and remained perplexed and dismayed. Nobody had come out at the gate with us, nobody went in at the gate with me.
<p/>As I crossed by the fountain, I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) lighted back windows looking bright and quiet, and, when I stood for a few moments in the doorway of the building where I lived, before going up the stairs, Garden Court was as still and lifeless as the staircase was when I ascended it.
<p/>Herbert received me with open arms, and I had never felt before so blessedly what it is to have a friend.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had spoken some sound words of sympathy and encouragement, we sat down to consider the question, What was to be done?
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had a barrack way with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) of hanging about one spot, in one unsettled manner, and going through one round of observances with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pipe and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) negro-head and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) jackknife and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pack of cards, and what not, as if it were all put down for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) on a slate,--I say his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) chair remaining where it had stood, Herbert unconsciously took it, but next moment started out of it, pushed it away, and took another.
<p/>The chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had stood,--for He (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) had no occasion to say after that that he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) had conceived an aversion for my patron,
<p/>neither had I occasion to confess my own. We interchanged that confidence without shaping a syllable. '' What,'' said I to Herbert, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was safe in another chair,--<div class="bookquote">``what is to be done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' My poor dear Handel,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) replied, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``I am too stunned to think.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' So was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell.
<p/>Still, something must be done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) is intent upon various new expenses,--horses, and carriages, and lavish appearances of all kinds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) must be stopped somehow.
<p/>'' '' You mean that you can't accept-- '' <div class="bookquote">``How can I? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interposed, as Herbert paused. <div class="bookquote">``Think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)!
<p/>Look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>An involuntary shudder passed over both of us. '' Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) is attached to me, strongly attached to me.
<p/>Was there ever such a fate!'' '' My poor dear Handel,'' Herbert repeated. '' Then,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``after all, stopping short here, never taking another penny from him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), think what I owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) already!
<p/>Then again: I am heavily in debt,--very heavily for me, who have now no expectations,--and I have been bred to no calling, and I am fit for nothing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Well, well, well!'' Herbert remonstrated. '' Don't say fit for nothing. '' '' What am I fit for? I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that is, to go for a soldier.
<p/>And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, but for the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection. ''
<p/>Of course I broke down there: and of course Herbert, beyond seizing a warm grip of my hand, pretended not to know it.
<p/>If you were to renounce this patronage and these favors, I suppose you would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have already had.
<p/>'' Anyhow, my dear Handel,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) presently, <div class="bookquote">``soldiering won't do. Not very strong, that hope, if you went soldiering! Besides, it's absurd.
<p/>You would be infinitely better in Clarriker's house, small as it is. I am working up towards a partnership, you know.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Poor fellow! He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) little suspected with whose money. '' But there is another question,'' said Herbert. '' This is an ignorant, determined man, who has long had one fixed idea.
<p/>More than that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) seems to me -LRB-I may misjudge him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)-RRB- to be a man of a desperate and fierce character.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) is,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned. <div class="bookquote">``Let me tell you what evidence I have seen of it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And I told him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) what I had not mentioned in my narrative, of that encounter with the other convict.
<p/>'' See, then,'' said Herbert; <div class="bookquote">``think of this! He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) comes here at the peril of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) life, for the realization of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) fixed idea.
<p/>In the moment of realization, after all his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) toil and waiting, you cut the ground from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) feet, destroy his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) idea, and make his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) gains worthless to him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).
<p/>Do you see nothing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) might do, under the disappointment?''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have seen it, Herbert, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) arrival.
<p/>Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) putting himself in the way of being taken.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then you may rely upon it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``that there would be great danger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) doing it.
<p/>That is his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) power over you as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) remains in England, and that would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) reckless course if you forsook him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).
<p/>I was so struck by the horror of this idea, which had weighed upon me from the first, and the working out of which would make me regard myself, in some sort, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) murderer, that I could not rest in my chair, but began pacing to and fro.
<p/>I said to Herbert, meanwhile, that even if Provis were recognized and taken, in spite of himself, I should be wretched as the cause, however innocently.
<p/>Yes; even though I was so wretched in having him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) at large and near me, and even though I would far rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than I would ever have come to this!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>But there was no staving off the question, What was to be done? '' The first and the main thing to be done,'' said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``is to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) out of England.
<p/>You will have to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) may be induced to go.''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>'' But get him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) where I will, could I prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) coming back?''
<p/>My good Handel, is it not obvious that with Newgate in the next street, there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) and making him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) reckless, here, than elsewhere?
<p/>If a pretext to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) away could be made out of that other convict, or out of anything else in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) life, now.
<p/>There, again!'' said I, stopping before Herbert, with my open hands held out, as if they contained the desperation of the case.
<p/>It has almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) before me, so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes, and yet so unknown to me, except as the miserable wretch who terrified me two days in my childhood!''
<p/>'' '' '' '' I know nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) life. Herbert got up, and linked his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) arm in mine, and we slowly walked to and fro together, studying the carpet.
<p/>'' Handel,'' said Herbert, stopping, <div class="bookquote">``you feel convinced that you can take no further benefits from him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>); do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fully. Surely you would, too, if you were in my place?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And you have, and are bound to have, that tenderness for the life he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) has risked on your account, that you must save him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), if possible, from throwing it away.
<p/>'' And you feel convinced that you must break with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``Herbert, can you ask me?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' Then you must get him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) out of England before you stir a finger to extricate yourself.
<p/>That done, extricate yourself, in Heaven's name, and we'll see it out together, dear old boy. '' It was a comfort to shake hands upon it, and walk up and down again, with only that done.
<p/>'' Now, Herbert,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``with reference to gaining some knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) history. There is but one way that I know of.
<p/>I must ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) point blank.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>),'' said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``when we sit at breakfast in the morning. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had said, on taking leave of Herbert, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) would come to breakfast with us. With this project formed, we went to bed.
<p/>I had the wildest dreams concerning him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and woke unrefreshed; I woke, too, to recover the fear which I had lost in the night, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) being found out as a returned transport.
<p/>Waking, I never lost that fear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) came round at the appointed time, took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) jackknife, and sat down to his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) meal.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was full of plans <div class="bookquote">``for his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) gentleman's coming out strong, and like a gentleman,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and urged me to begin speedily upon the pocket-book which he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had left in my possession.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) considered the chambers and his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) own lodging as temporary residences, and advised me to look out at once for a <div class="bookquote">``fashionable crib''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>near Hyde Park, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) could have ``a shake-down.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) had made an end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) breakfast, and was wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) knife on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>) leg, I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hyde</b></font>), without a word of preface,-- <div class="bookquote">``After you were gone last night, I told my friend of the struggle that the soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes, when we came up.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>You remember?'' <div class="bookquote">``Remember!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). '' I think so!'' '' We want to know something about that man--and about you.
<p/>It is strange to know no more about either, and particularly you, than I was able to tell last night. Is not this as good a time as another for our knowing more?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, after consideration. '' You're on your oath, you know, Pip's comrade?'' <div class="bookquote">``Assuredly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>replied Herbert. '' As to anything I say, you know,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) insisted.
<p/>'' The oath applies to all. '' <div class="bookquote">``I understand it to do so.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And look`ee here! Wotever I done is worked out and paid for,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) insisted again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) black pipe and was going to fill it with negro-head, when, looking at the tangle of tobacco in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) seemed to think it might perplex the thread of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) narrative.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) put it back again, stuck his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) pipe in a button-hole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) coat, spread a hand on each knee, and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moments, looked round at us and said what follows.
<p/>'' So be it. '' Chapter XLII '' Dear boy and Pip's comrade. I am not a going fur to tell you my life like a song, or a story-book.
<p/>But to give it you short and handy, I'll put it at once into a mouthful of English. In jail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail.
<p/>There, you've got it. That's my life pretty much, down to such times as I got shipped off, arter Pip stood my friend.
<p/>I've been carted here and carted there, and put out of this town, and put out of that town, and stuck in the stocks, and whipped and worried and drove.
<p/>'' I've been done everything to, pretty well--except hanged. I've been locked up as much as a silver tea-kittle. I've no more notion where I was born than you have--if so much.
<p/>I first become aware of myself down in Essex, a thieving turnips for my living. Summun had run away from me--a man--a tinker--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d took the fire with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and left me wery cold.
<p/>'' I know'd my name to be Magwitch, chrisen'd Abel. How did I know it? Much as I know'd the birds' names in the hedges to be chaffinch, sparrer, thrush.
<p/>I might have thought it was all lies together, only as the birds' names come out true, I supposed mine did.
<p/>So fur as I could find, there warn't a soul that see young Abel Magwitch, with us little on him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) as in him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>), but wot caught fright at him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>), and either drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) off, or took him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) up.
<p/>This is the way it was, that when I was a ragged little creetur as much to be pitied as ever I see -LRB-not that I looked in the glass, for there
<p/>'' I was took up, took up, took up, to that extent that I reg`larly grow'd up took up. '' warn't many insides of furnished houses known to me-RRB-
<p/>, I got the name of being hardened. ' This is a terrible hardened one,' they says to prison wisitors, picking out me. '
<p/>May be said to live in jails, this boy.' Then they looked at me, and I looked at them, and they measured my head, some on '
<p/>em,--they had better a measured my stomach,--and others on 'em giv me tracts what I couldn't read, and made me speeches what I couldn't understand.
<p/>They always went on agen me about the Devil. But what the Devil was I to do? I must put something into my stomach, mustn't I?--Howsomever
<p/>, I'm a getting low, and I know what's due. Dear boy and Pip's comrade, don't you be afeerd of me being low.
<p/>Tramping, begging, thieving, working sometimes when I could,--though that warn't as often as you may think, till you put the question whether you would ha' been over-ready to give me work yourselves,--a bit of a poacher, a bit of a laborer, a bit of a wagoner, a bit of a haymaker, a bit of a hawker, a bit of most things that don't pay and lead to trouble, I got to be a man.
<p/>A deserting soldier in a Traveller's Rest, what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs, learnt me to read; and a travelling Giant what signed his (<font color='blue'><b>Traveller</b></font>) name at a penny a time learnt me to write.
<p/>'' I warn't locked up as often now as formerly, but I wore out my good share of key-metal still. ''
<p/>At Epsom races, a matter of over twenty years ago, I got acquainted wi' a man whose skull I'd crack wi'
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right name was Compeyson; and that's the man, dear boy, what you see me a pounding in the ditch, according to what you truly told your comrade arter
<p/>this poker, like the claw of a lobster, if I'd got it on this hob. I was gone last night. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) set up fur a gentleman, this Compeyson, and he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>)'d been to a public boarding-school and had learning. He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) was a smooth one to talk, and was a dab at the ways of gentlefolks.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) was good-looking too. It was the night afore the great race, when I found him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) on the heath, in a booth that I know'd on.
<p/>Him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) and some more was a sitting among the tables when I went in, and the landlord -LRB-which had a knowledge of me, and was a sporting one-RRB- called him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) out, and said, 'I think this is a man that might suit you,'--meaning
<p/>I was. '' Compeyson, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looks at me very noticing, and I look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a watch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome suit of clothes.
<p/>''`To judge from appearances, you're out of luck,' says Compeyson to me. '' `Yes, master, and I've never been in it much.'
<p/>-LRB-I had come out of Kingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal. Not but what it might have been for something else; but it warn't.-RRB-
<p/>'' `Luck changes,' says Compeyson; `perhaps yours is going to change.' '' I says, 'I hope it may be so. There's room.'
<p/>''`What can you do?' says Compeyson. '' `Eat and drink,' I says; `if you'll find the materials.' '' Compeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me five shillings, and appointed me for next night.
<p/>Same place. '' I went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson took me on to be his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) man and pardner.
<p/>And what was Compeyson's business in which we was to go pardners? Compeyson's business was the swindling, handwriting forging, stolen bank-note passing, and such-like.
<p/>All sorts of traps as Compeyson could set with his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) head, and keep his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) own legs out of and get the profits from and let another man in for, was Compeyson's business.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d no more heart than a iron file, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was as cold as death, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the head of the Devil afore mentioned.
<p/>'' There was another in with Compeyson, as was called Arthur,--not as being so chrisen'd, but as a surname. He (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was in a Decline, and was a shadow to look at.
<p/>Him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a rich lady some years afore, and they'd made a pot of money by it; but Compeyson betted and gamed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>)'d have run through the king's taxes.
<p/>So, Arthur was a dying, and a dying poor and with the horrors on him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), and Compeyson's wife -LRB-which Compeyson kicked mostly-RRB- was a having pity on him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could, and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and nobody.
<p/>I might a took warning by Arthur, but I didn't; and I won't pretend I was partick`ler--for where `ud be the good on it, dear boy and comrade?
<p/>Arthur lived at the top of Compeyson's house -LRB-over nigh Brentford it was-RRB-, and Compeyson kept a careful account agen him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) for board and lodging, in case he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) should ever get better to work it out.
<p/>'' So I begun wi' Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hands. But Arthur soon settled the account.
<p/>The second or third time as ever I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) come a tearing down into Compeyson's parlor late at night, in only a flannel gown, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hair all in a sweat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) says to Compeyson's wife, `Sally, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) really is upstairs alonger me, now, and I can't get rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'s all in white,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) says, `wi' white flowers in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) hair, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'s awful mad, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'s got a shroud hanging over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) arm, and
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'ll put it on me at five in the morning.' <div class="bookquote">``Says Compeyson: `Why, you fool, don't you know she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'s got a living body?
<p/>And how should she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) be up there, without coming through the door, or in at the window, and up the stairs?'
<p/>'I don't know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'s there,' says Arthur, shivering dreadful with the horrors, `but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>)'s standing in the corner at the foot of the bed, awful mad.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And over where her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) heart's broke--you broke it!--there's drops of blood.' '' Compeyson spoke hardy, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) was always a coward. '
<p/>Go up alonger this drivelling sick man,' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, `and Magwitch, lend her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a hand, will you?' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) never come nigh himself.
<p/>'' Compeyson's wife and me took him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) up to bed agen, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) raved most dreadful. ' Why look at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)!'
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) cries out. ' She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s a shaking the shroud at me! Don't you see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)? Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eyes! Ain't it awful to see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) so mad?'
<p/>Next he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) cries, `She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'ll put it on me, and then I'm done for! Take it away from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), take it away!'
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) catched hold of us, and kep on a talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and answering of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), till I half believed I see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) myself.
<p/>Compeyson's wife, being used to him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>), giv him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) some liquor to get the horrors off, and by and by he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) quieted. '
<p/>'' O, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s gone! Has her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) keeper been for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?' he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) says. ' Yes,' says Compeyson's wife. ' Did you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) to lock her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and bar her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in?' '
<p/>Yes.' `And to take that ugly thing away from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?' `Yes, yes, all right.' ' You're a good creetur,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) says, `don't leave me, whatever you do, and thank you!'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) starts up with a scream, and screams out, `Here she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is!
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s got the shroud again. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s unfolding it. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s coming out of the corner. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s coming to the bed. Hold me, both on you--
<p/>one of each side--don't let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) touch me with it. Hah! she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) missed me that time. Don't let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) throw it over my shoulders.
<p/>Don't let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lift me up to get it round me. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s lifting me up. Keep me down!' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lifted himself up hard, and was dead.
<p/>Him (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and me was soon busy, and first he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) swore me -LRB-being ever artful-RRB- on my own book,--this here little black book,
<p/>'' Compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides. dear boy, what I swore your comrade on. ''
<p/>I'll simply say to you, dear boy, and Pip's comrade, that that man got me into such nets as made me his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) black slave.
<p/>Not to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I done--which `ud take a week-- I was always in debt to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), always under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thumb, always a working, always a getting into danger.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was younger than me, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d got craft, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d got learning, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) overmatched me five hundred times told and no mercy.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in a confused way, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place in the book of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembrance; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face to the fire, and spread his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands broader on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees, and lifted them off and put them on again.
<p/>My Missis as I had the hard time wi'--Stop though! I ain't brought her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) in-- '' There ain't no need to go into it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, looking round once more.
<p/>'' The time wi' Compeyson was a`most as hard a time as ever I had; that said, all's said. Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, for misdemeanor, while with Compeyson?
<p/>As to took up on suspicion, that was twice or three times in the four or five year that it lasted; but evidence was wanting.
<p/>'' I answered, No. <div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I was, and got convicted. At last, me and Compeyson was both committed for felony,--on a charge of putting stolen notes in circulation,--and
<p/>And I was so miserable poor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung on my back, afore
<p/>there was other charges behind. Compeyson says to me, `Separate defences, no communication,' and that was all. I could get Jaggers.
<p/>wi' his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) curly hair and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) black clothes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) white pocket-handkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked.
<p/>When the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short, aforehand, I noticed how heavy it all bore on me, and how light on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>).
<p/>When the evidence was giv in the box, I noticed how it was always me that had come for`ard, and could be swore to, how it was always me that the money had been paid to, how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing and get the profit.
<p/>But when the defence come on, then I see the plan plainer; for, says the counsellor for Compeyson, `My lord and gentlemen, here you has afore you, side by side, two persons as your eyes can separate wide; one, the younger, well brought up, who will be spoke to as such;
<p/>one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke to as such; one, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these here transactions, and only suspected; t`other, the elder, always seen in 'em and always wi' his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) guilt brought home.
<p/>Can you doubt, if there is but one in it, which is the one, and, if there is two in it, which is much the worst one?'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>When we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentleman Compeyson looked, And such-like. And when it come to character, warn't
<p/>it Compeyson as had been to the school, and warn't it his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) schoolfellows as was in this position and in that, and warn't
<p/>it me as had been tried afore, and as had been know'd up hill and down dale in Bridewells and Lock-Ups!
<p/>it him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) as had been know'd by witnesses in such clubs and societies, and nowt to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) disadvantage? And warn't And when it come to speech-making, warn't
<p/>it Compeyson as could speak to 'em wi' his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) face dropping every now and then into his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) white pocket- handkercher,--ah! and wi' verses in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) speech,
<p/>too,--and warn't it me as could only say, `Gentlemen, this man at my side is a most precious rascal'? And when the verdict come, warn't
<p/>it Compeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company, and giving up all the information he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) could agen me, and
<p/>And when I says to Compeyson, `Once out of this court, I'll smash that face of yourn!' ain't it Compeyson as prays the Judge to be protected, and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us?
<p/>And when we're sentenced, ain't it him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) as gets seven year, and me fourteen, and ain't it him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) as the Judge is sorry for, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) might a done so well, and ain't it me as the Judge perceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion, likely to come to worse?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) had worked himself into a state of great excitement, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) checked it, took two or three short breaths, swallowed as often, and stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) hand towards me said, in a reassuring manner, <div class="bookquote">``I ain't a going to be low, dear boy!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had so heated himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) handkerchief and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face and head and neck and hands, before he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could go on.
<p/>warn't it me as got never a word but Guilty? ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' '' I had said to Compeyson that I'd smash that face of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and I swore Lord smash mine!
<p/>At last I come behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) and hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) on the cheek to turn him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) round and get a smashing one at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), when I was seen and seized.
<p/>to do it. We was in the same prison-ship, but I couldn't get at him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) for long, though I tried. The black-hole of that ship warn't a strong one, to a judge of black-holes that could swim and dive.
<p/>I escaped to the shore, and I was a hiding among the graves there, envying them as was in 'em and all over, when I first see my boy!''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) regarded me with a look of affection that made him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) almost abhorrent to me again, though I had felt great pity for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>Upon my soul, I half believe he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) escaped in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) terror, to get quit of me, not knowing it was me as had got ashore.
<p/>'' By my boy, I was giv to understand as Compeyson was out on them marshes too. I hunted him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) down.
<p/>I smashed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face. ' And now,' says I `as the worst thing I can do, caring nothing for myself, I'll drag you back.'
<p/>And I'd have swum off, towing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) by the hair, if it had come to that, and I'd a got him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) aboard without the soldiers.
<p/>'' Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d much the best of it to the last,--his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) character was so good. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had escaped when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was made half wild by me and my murderous intentions; and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) punishment was light.
<p/>I was put in irons, brought to trial again, and sent for life. I didn't stop for life, dear boy and Pip's comrade, being here.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wiped himself again, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had done before, and then slowly took his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tangle of tobacco from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pocket, and plucked his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pipe from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) button-hole, and slowly filled it, and began to smoke.
<p/>'' '' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dead? '' I asked, after a silence. '' Is who dead, dear boy?'' <div class="bookquote">``Compeyson.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hopes I am, if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s alive, you may be sure,'' with a fierce look.
<p/>'' I never heerd no more of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). '' Herbert had been writing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) pencil in the cover of a book.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) softly pushed the book over to me, as Provis stood smoking with his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) eyes on the fire, and I read in it:-- <div class="bookquote">``Young Havisham's name was Arthur.
<p/>I shut the book and nodded slightly to Herbert, and put the book by; but we neither of us said anything, and both looked at Provis as he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) stood smoking by the fire.
<p/>Compeyson is the man who professed to be Miss Havisham's lover. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Chapter XLIII Why should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from Provis might be traced to Estella?
<p/>Why should I loiter on my road, to compare the state of mind in which I had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison before meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) at the coach-office, with the state of mind in which I now reflected on the abyss between Estella in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) pride and beauty, and the returned transport whom I harbored?
<p/>The road would be none the smoother for it, the end would be none the better for it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) would not be helped, nor I extenuated.
<p/>A new fear had been engendered in my mind by his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) narrative; or rather, his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already there.
<p/>That Compeyson stood in mortal fear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>), neither of the two could know much better than I; and that any such man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release himself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an informer was scarcely to be imagined.
<p/>If Compeyson were alive and should discover his (<font color='blue'><b>informer</b></font>) return, I could hardly doubt the consequence. Never had I breathed, and never would I breathe--or
<p/>so I resolved--a word of Estella to Provis. But, I said to Herbert that, before I could go abroad, I must see both Estella and Miss Havisham.
<p/>This was when we were left alone on the night of the day when Provis told us his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) story. I resolved to go out to Richmond next day, and I went.
<p/>On my presenting myself at Mrs. Brandley's, Estella's maid was called to tell that Estella had gone into the country. Where?
<p/>To Satis House, as usual. Not as usual, I said, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had never yet gone there without me; when was she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) coming back?
<p/>There was an air of reservation in the answer which increased my perplexity, and the answer was, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) maid believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was only coming back at all for a little while.
<p/>I could make nothing of this, except that it was meant that I should make nothing of it, and I went home again in complete discomfiture.
<p/>Another night consultation with Herbert after Provis was gone home -LRB-I always took him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) home, and always looked well about me-RRB-, led us to the conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until I came back from Miss Havisham's.
<p/>In the mean time, Herbert and I were to consider separately what it would be best to say; whether we should devise any pretence of being afraid that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was under suspicious observation; or whether I, who had never yet been abroad, should propose an expedition.
<p/>We both knew that I had but to propose anything, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) would consent. We agreed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) remaining many days in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) present hazard was not to be thought of.
<p/>Next day I had the meanness to feign that I was under a binding promise to go down to Joe; but I was capable of almost any meanness towards Joe or his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) name.
<p/>Provis was to be strictly careful while I was gone, and Herbert was to take the charge of him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) that I had taken.
<p/>I was to be absent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to be begun.
<p/>It occurred to me then, and as I afterwards found to Herbert also, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) might be best got away across the water, on that pretence,--as, to make purchases, or the like.
<p/>Having thus cleared the way for my expedition to Miss Havisham's, I set off by the early morning coach before it was yet light, and was out on the open country road when the day came creeping on, halting and whimpering and shivering, and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of mist, like a beggar.
<p/>When we drove up to the Blue Boar after a drizzly ride, whom should I see come out under the gateway, toothpick in hand, to look at the coach, but Bentley Drummle!
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) pretended not to see me, I pretended not to see him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>). It was a very lame pretence on both sides;
<p/>the lamer, because we both went into the coffee-room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had just finished his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) breakfast, and where I ordered mine.
<p/>It was poisonous to me to see him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) in the town, for I very well knew why he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had come there.
<p/>Pretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date, which had nothing half so legible in its local news, as the foreign matter of coffee, pickles, fish sauces, gravy, melted butter, and wine with which it was sprinkled all over, as if it had taken the measles in a highly irregular form, I sat at my table while he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) stood before the fire.
<p/>By degrees it became an enormous injury to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) stood before the fire. And I got up, determined to have my share of it.
<p/>I had to put my hand behind his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to stir the fire, but still pretended not to know him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this a cut?''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Mr. Drummle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Drummle. '' Oh!'' said I, poker in hand; <div class="bookquote">``it's you, is it? How do you do?
<p/>With that, I poked tremendously, and having done so, planted myself side by side with Mr. Drummle, my shoulders squared and my back to the fire.
<p/>I was wondering who it was, who kept the fire off. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' You have just come down?'' said Mr. Drummle, edging me a little away with his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>'' Yes,'' said I, edging him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) a little away with my shoulder. '' Beastly place,'' said Drummle. '' Your part of the country, I think?''
<p/>'' Yes,'' I assented. '' I am told it's very like your Shropshire. '' <div class="bookquote">``Not in the least like it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Mr. Drummle</b></font>)</div>said Drummle.
<p/>Here Mr. Drummle looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) boots and I looked at mine, and then Mr. Drummle looked at my boots, and I looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>).
<p/>'' Have you been here long? '' I asked, determined not to yield an inch of the fire. '' Long enough to be tired of it,'' returned Drummle, pretending to yawn, but equally determined.
<p/>I felt here, through a tingling in my blood, that if Mr. Drummle's shoulder had claimed another hair's breadth of room, I should have jerked him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) into the window; equally, that if my own shoulder had urged a similar claim, Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box.
<p/>'' Do you stay here long?'' <div class="bookquote">``Can't say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Mr. Drummle</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Drummle. <div class="bookquote">``Do you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can't say,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I. He (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) whistled a little.
<p/>What of that?'' said I. Mr. Drummle looked at me, and then at my boots, and then said, <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and laughed.
<p/>So did I. <div class="bookquote">``Large tract of marshes about here, I believe?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Drummle. '' Yes. '' Are you amused, Mr. Drummle?''
<p/>'' No,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``not particularly. I am going out for a ride in the saddle. I mean to explore those marshes for amusement.
<p/>Out-of-the-way villages there, they tell me. Curious little public-houses--and smithies--and that. Waiter!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Is that horse of mine ready?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Brought round to the door, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I say. Look here, you sir. The lady won't ride to-day; the weather won't do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Mr. Drummle</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) great-jowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) was, and so exasperated me, that I felt inclined to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) in my arms -LRB-as the robber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lady-RRB- and seat him (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) on the fire.
<p/>One thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until relief came, neither of us could relinquish the fire.
<p/>There we stood, well squared up before it, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with our hands behind us, not budging an inch.
<p/>The horse was visible outside in the drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table, Drummle's was cleared away, the waiter invited me to begin, I nodded, we both stood our ground.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' And I don't dine, because I'm going to dine at the lady's.'' <div class="bookquote">``Very good, sir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Have you been to the Grove since?'' said Drummle. '' No,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``I had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was there.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Was that when we had a difference of opinion?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Yes,'' I replied, very shortly. <div class="bookquote">``Come, come! They let you off easily enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sneered Drummle.
<p/>'' You shouldn't have lost your temper.'' <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Drummle,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``you are not competent to give advice on that subject.
<p/>When I lose my temper -LRB-not that I admit having done so on that occasion-RRB-, I don't throw glasses. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Mr. Drummle</b></font>)</div>said Drummle.
<p/>After glancing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) once or twice, in an increased state of smouldering ferocity, I said,-- <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Drummle, I did not seek this conversation, and I don't think it an agreeable one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure it's not,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>), superciliously over his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) shoulder; <div class="bookquote">``I don't think anything about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' And therefore,'' I went on, <div class="bookquote">``with your leave, I will suggest that we hold no kind of communication in future.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Quite my opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Mr. Drummle</b></font>)</div>said Drummle, <div class="bookquote">``and what I should have suggested myself, or done--more likely--without suggesting. But don't lose your temper.
<p/>Haven't you lost enough without that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Mr. Drummle</b></font>)</div>'' What do you mean, sir?'' <div class="bookquote">``Waiter! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Drummle/Mr. Drummle</b></font>)</div>said Drummle, by way of answering me.
<p/>The waiter reappeared. '' Look here, you sir. You quite understand that the young lady don't ride to-day, and that I dine at the young lady's?''
<p/>When the waiter had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) hand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out, Drummle, careful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar from his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) pocket and bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring.
<p/>Choking and boiling as I was, I felt that we could not go a word further, without introducing Estella's name, which I could not endure to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) utter; and therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall, as if there were no one present, and forced myself to silence.
<p/>How long we might have remained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say, but for the incursion of three thriving farmers--laid on by the waiter, I think--who came into the coffee-room unbuttoning their great-coats and rubbing their hands, and before whom, as they charged at the fire, we were obliged to give way.
<p/>I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) through the window, seizing his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) horse's mane, and mounting in his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing away.
<p/>I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) was gone, when he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) came back, calling for a light for the cigar in his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) mouth, which he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) had forgotten.
<p/>A man in a dust-colored dress appeared with what was wanted,--I could not have said from where: whether from the inn yard, or the street, or where not,--and as Drummle leaned down from the saddle and lighted his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) cigar and laughed, with a jerk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) head towards the coffee-room windows, the slouching shoulders and ragged hair of this man whose back was towards me reminded me of Orlick.
<p/>Too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) or no, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and the journey from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable old house that it would have been so much the better for me never to have entered, never to have seen.
<p/>In the room where the dressing-table stood, and where the wax-candles burnt on the wall, I found Miss Havisham and Estella; Miss Havisham seated on a settee near the fire, and Estella on a cushion at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) feet.
<p/>'' Quite so, sir!'' Chapter XLIV Estella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was looking on. They both raised their eyes as I went in, and both saw an alteration in me.
<p/>I derived that, from the look they interchanged. '' And what wind,'' said Miss Havisham, <div class="bookquote">``blows you here, Pip? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) looked steadily at me, I saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was rather confused.
<p/>Estella, pausing a moment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) knitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) eyes upon me, and then going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) fingers, as plainly
<p/>Miss Havisham,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``I went to Richmond yesterday, to speak to Estella; and finding that some wind had blown her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) here, I followed.
<p/>as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had told me in the dumb alphabet, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) perceived I had discovered my real benefactor. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Miss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down, I took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) occupy.
<p/>With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a natural place for me, that day. '' What I had to say to Estella, Miss Havisham, I will say before you, presently--in a few moments.
<p/>It will not surprise you, it will not displease you. I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be.
<p/>I could see in the action of Estella's fingers as they worked that she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) attended to what I said; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) did not look up.
<p/>'' Miss Havisham continued to look steadily at me. '' I have found out who my patron is. It is not a fortunate discovery, and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune, anything.
<p/>As I was silent for a while, looking at Estella and considering how to go on, Miss Havisham repeated, ``It is not your secret, but another's.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When you first caused me to be brought here, Miss Havisham, when I belonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never left, I suppose I did really come here, as any other chance boy might have come,--as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and to be paid for it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>There are reasons why I must say no more of that. It is not my secret, but another's. '' Well?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ay, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) head; <div class="bookquote">``you did.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Havisham</b></font>)</div><p/>And that Mr. Jaggers--'' <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Jaggers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Miss Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone, <div class="bookquote">``had nothing to do with it, and knew nothing of it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) being my lawyer, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) holds the same relation towards numbers of people, and it might easily arise.
<p/>Be that as it may, it did arise, and was not brought about by any one. '' Any one might have seen in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) haggard face that there was no suppression or evasion so far.
<p/>But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at least you led me on?'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) returned, again nodding steadily, <div class="bookquote">``I let you go on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Who am I,'' cried Miss Havisham, striking her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stick upon the floor and flashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) in surprise,--<div class="bookquote">``who am I, for God's sake, that I should be kind?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Was that kind?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' It was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to make it.
<p/>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) so, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) sat brooding after this outburst. '' Well, well, well! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said. '' What else?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was liberally paid for my old attendance here,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``in being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only for my own information.
<p/>In humoring my mistake, Miss Havisham, you punished--practised on--perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses your intention, without offence--your self-seeking relations?''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>What follows has another -LRB-and I hope more disinterested-RRB- purpose. <div class="bookquote">``I did. Why, they would have it so! So would you.
<p/>What has been my history, that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you not to have it so!
<p/>You made your own snares. I never made them. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Waiting until she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was quiet again,--for this, too, flashed out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) in a wild and sudden way,--I went on.
<p/>I have been thrown among one family of your relations, Miss Havisham, and have been constantly among them since I went to London.
<p/>And I should be false and base if I did not tell you, whether it is acceptable to you or no, and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no, that you deeply wrong both Mr. Matthew Pocket and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) son Herbert, if you suppose them to be otherwise than generous, upright, open, and incapable of anything designing or mean.''
<p/>'' I know them to have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself. '' They are your friends,'' said Miss Havisham.
<p/>They made themselves my friends,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``when they supposed me to have superseded them; and when Sarah Pocket, Miss Georgiana, and Mistress Camilla were not my friends, I think.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' This contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, to do them good with her (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) looked at me keenly for a little while, and then said quietly,-- <div class="bookquote">``What do you want for them?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Only,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``that you would not confound them with the others.
<p/>They may be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are not of the same nature. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Still looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated,--
<p/>conscious that I reddened a little, ``as that I could hide from you, even if I desired, that I do want something.
<p/>Miss Havisham, if you would spare the money to do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life, but which from the nature of the case must be done without his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) knowledge, I could show you how.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What do you want for them?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am not so cunning, you see,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, in answer, '' <div class="bookquote">``Why must it be done without his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) knowledge?
<p/>Because,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I began the service myself, more than two years ago, without his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) knowledge, and I don't want to be betrayed.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) asked, settling her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) stick, that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) might regard me the more attentively. '' Why I fail in my ability to finish it, I cannot explain.
<p/>It is a part of the secret which is another person's and not mine. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) gradually withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) eyes from me, and turned them on the fire.
<p/>After watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of the slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was roused by the collapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me again--at first, vacantly--then, with a gradually concentrating attention.
<p/>When Miss Havisham had fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) attention on me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) said, speaking as if there had been no lapse in our dialogue,--
<p/>All this time Estella knitted on. <div class="bookquote">``What else?''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>'' Estella,'' said I, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) now, and trying to command my trembling voice, <div class="bookquote">``you know I love you.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) fingers plied their work, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looked at me with an unmoved countenance.
<p/>You know that I have loved you long and dearly. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), and from her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) to me.
<p/>'' I should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake. It induced me to hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another.
<p/>While I thought you could not help yourself, as it were, I refrained from saying it. But I must say it now.
<p/>'' Preserving her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) unmoved countenance, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) fingers still going, Estella shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) head. '' I know,'' said I, in answer to that action,--<div class="bookquote">``I know.
<p/>I have no hope that I shall ever call you mine, Estella. I am ignorant what may become of me very soon
<p/>, how poor I may be, or where I may go. Still, I love you. I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house.
<p/>It would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to practise on the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me through all these years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) had reflected on the gravity of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) did.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) fingers busy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) head again. '' But I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) did not.
<p/>I saw Miss Havisham put her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) heart and hold it there, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) sat looking by turns at Estella and at me.
<p/>I think that, in the endurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) own trial, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) forgot mine, Estella. '' '' It seems,'' said Estella, very calmly, <div class="bookquote">``that there are sentiments, fancies,--I don't know how to call them,--which
<p/>I am not able to comprehend. When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a form of words; but nothing more.
<p/>You address nothing in my breast, you touch nothing there. I don't care for what you say at all. I have tried to warn you of this; now, have I not?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>I said in a miserable manner, <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not mean it.
<p/>Now, did you not think so?'' <div class="bookquote">``I thought and hoped you could not mean it. You, so young, untried, and beautiful, Estella!
<p/>Surely it is not in Nature.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is in my nature,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) returned. And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) added, with a stress upon the words, <div class="bookquote">``It is in the nature formed within me.
<p/>I make a great difference between you and all other people when I say so much. I can do no more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it not true,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``that Bentley Drummle is in town here, and pursuing you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is quite true,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) replied, referring to him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) with the indifference of utter contempt.
<p/>'' That you encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), and ride out with him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) dines with you this very day? '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Drummle</b></font>) seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied, <div class="bookquote">``Quite true.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot love him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), Estella!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) fingers stopped for the first time, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) retorted rather angrily, <div class="bookquote">``What have I told you?
<p/>Do you still think, in spite of it, that I do not mean what I say?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You would never marry him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), Estella?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) work in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) hands. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Why not tell you the truth?
<p/>I dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself better than I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) say those words.
<p/>When I raised my face again, there was such a ghastly look upon Miss Havisham's, that it impressed me, even in my passionate hurry and grief.
<p/>I am going to be married to him (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Estella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this fatal step.
<p/>Miss Havisham gives you to him (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), as the greatest slight and injury that could be done to the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who truly love you.
<p/>Among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) has not loved you as long, as I. Take him (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), and I can bear it better, for your sake!
<p/>My earnestness awoke a wonder in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) that seemed as if it would have been touched with compassion, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) could have rendered me at all intelligible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) own mind.
<p/>Put me aside for ever,--you have done so, I well know,--but bestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle. '' ''
<p/>I am going,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) said again, in a gentler voice, <div class="bookquote">``to be married to him (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>). The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be married soon.
<p/>Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by adoption? It is my own act.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Your own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?''
<p/>Should I fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel -LRB-if people do feel such things-RRB- that I took nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?
<p/>'' On whom should I fling myself away? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) retorted, with a smile. '' There! It is done. I shall do well enough, and so will my husband.
<p/>As to leading me into what you call this fatal step, Miss Havisham would have had me wait, and not marry yet; but I am tired of the life I have led, which has very few charms for me, and I am willing enough to change it.
<p/>Say no more. We shall never understand each other.'' <div class="bookquote">``Such a mean brute, such a stupid brute! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I urged, in despair.
<p/>'' Don't be afraid of my being a blessing to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>),'' said Estella; ``I shall not be that. Come! Here is my hand.
<p/>I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand, do what I would to restrain them; <div class="bookquote">``even if I remained in England and could hold my head up with the rest, how could I see you Drummle's wife?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Do we part on this, you visionary boy--or man?'' <div class="bookquote">``O Estella!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) returned,--<div class="bookquote">``nonsense. This will pass in no time.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Never, Estella!'' <div class="bookquote">``You will get me out of your thoughts in a week. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Out of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of myself.
<p/>You have been in every line I have ever read since I first came here, the rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then.
<p/>You have been in every prospect I have ever seen since,--on the river, on the sails of the ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the darkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets.
<p/>The stones of which the strongest London buildings are made are not more real, or more impossible to be displaced by your hands, than your presence and influence have been to me, there and everywhere, and will be.
<p/>Estella, to the last hour of my life, you cannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the little good in me, part of the evil.
<p/>But, in this separation, I associate you only with the good; and I will faithfully hold you to that always, for you must have done me far more good than harm, let me feel now what sharp distress I may.
<p/>You have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become acquainted with. O God bless you, God forgive you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>In what ecstasy of unhappiness I got these broken words out of myself, I don't know. The rhapsody welled up within me, like blood from an inward wound, and gushed out.
<p/>I remembered,--and soon afterwards with stronger reason,--that while Estella looked at me merely with incredulous wonder, the spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) hand still covering her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) heart, seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of pity and remorse.
<p/>I held her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) hand to my lips some lingering moments, and so I left her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>). But ever afterwards, All done, all gone!
<p/>So much was done and gone, that when I went out at the gate, the light of the day seemed of a darker color than when I went in.
<p/>For a while, I hid myself among some lanes and by-paths, and then struck off to walk all the way to London.
<p/>For, I had by that time come to myself so far as to consider that I could not go back to the inn and see Drummle there; that I could not bear to sit upon the coach and be spoken to; that I could do nothing half so good for myself as tire myself out.
<p/>Pursuing the narrow intricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the Middlesex shore of the river, my readiest access to the Temple was close by the river-side, through Whitefriars.
<p/>I was not expected till to-morrow; but I had my keys, and, if Herbert were gone to bed, could get to bed myself without disturbing him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).
<p/>As it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate after the Temple was closed, and as I was very muddy and weary, I did not take it ill that the night-porter examined me with much attention as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) held the gate a little way open for me to pass in.
<p/>It was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge. To help his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) memory I mentioned my name. '' I was not quite sure, sir, but I thought so.
<p/>Here's a note, sir. The messenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my lantern?
<p/>It was directed to Philip Pip, Esquire, and on the top of the superscription were the words, <div class="bookquote">``PLEASE READ THIS, HERE.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Esquire</b></font>)</div>Much surprised by the request, I took the note. '' I opened it, the watchman holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) light, and read inside, in Wemmick's writing,--
<p/>Chapter XLV Turning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning, I made the best of my way to Fleet Street, and there got a late hackney chariot and drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden.
<p/>In those times a bed was always to be got there at any hour of the night, and the chamberlain, letting me in at his (<font color='blue'><b>chamberlain</b></font>) ready wicket, lighted the candle next in order on his (<font color='blue'><b>chamberlain</b></font>) shelf, and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on his (<font color='blue'><b>chamberlain</b></font>) list.
<p/>It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the back, with a despotic monster of a four-post bedstead in it, straddling over the whole place, putting one of his (<font color='blue'><b>chamberlain</b></font>) arbitrary legs into the fireplace and another into the doorway, and squeezing the wretched little washing-stand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner.
<p/>As I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in, before he (<font color='blue'><b>chamberlain</b></font>) left me, the good old constitutional rushlight of those virtuous days--an object like the ghost of a walking-cane, which instantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could ever be lighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at the bottom of a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made a staringly wide-awake pattern on the walls.
<p/>When I had got into bed, and lay there footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more close my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``DON'T GO HOME. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And thus, in the gloom and death of the night, we stared at one another. What a doleful night!
<p/>There was an inhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as I looked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what a number of blue-bottle flies from the butchers', and earwigs from the market, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying by for next summer.
<p/>This led me to speculate whether any of them ever tumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,--a disagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionable approaches up my back.
<p/>How anxious, how dismal, how long! When I had lain awake a little while, those extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves audible.
<p/>At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired a new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I saw written, DON'T GO HOME.
<p/>The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little washing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the chest of drawers. Whatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they never warded off this DON'T GO HOME.
<p/>Not long before, I had read in the newspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums in the night, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and had been found in the morning weltering in blood.
<p/>It came into my head that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) must have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to assure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the door to look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship of a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing.
<p/>But all this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home, and when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were questions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed there could be no more room in it for any other theme.
<p/>Even when I thought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when I recalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looks and tones, and the action of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) fingers while she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) knitted,--even
<p/>It plaited itself into whatever I thought of, as a bodily pain would have done. then I was pursuing, here and there and everywhere,
<p/>When at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became a vast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate.
<p/>Imperative mood, present tense: Do not thou go home, let him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) not go home, let us not go home, do not ye or you go home
<p/>Then potentially: I may not and I cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, and should not go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, and rolled over on the pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again.
<p/>I had left directions that I was to be called at seven; for it was plain that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally plain that this was a case in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) Walworth sentiments only could be taken.
<p/>It was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been so miserable, and I needed no second knocking at the door to startle me from my uneasy bed.
<p/>the caution, Don't go home. , let not them go home. The Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o'clock.
<p/>The little servant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls, I passed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) company, and so came without announcement into the presence of Wemmick as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was making tea for himself and the Aged.
<p/>An open door afforded a perspective view of the Aged in bed. '' Halloa, Mr. Pip!'' said Wemmick. '' You did come home, then?''
<p/>'' Yes,'' I returned; <div class="bookquote">``but I didn't go home.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' That's all right,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hands. '' I left a note for you at each of the Temple gates, on the chance.
<p/>Which gate did you come to? '' I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>). '' I'll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the notes,'' said Wemmick;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``it's a good rule never to leave documentary evidence if you can help it, because you don't know when it may be put in.
<p/>I'm going to take a liberty with you. Would you mind toasting this sausage for the Aged P.? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>I said I should be delighted to do it.
<p/>Then you can go about your work, Mary Anne,'' said Wemmick to the little servant; <div class="bookquote">``which leaves us to ourselves, don't you see, Mr. Pip?
<p/>I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) friendship and caution, and our discourse proceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Aged's sausage and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) buttered the crumb of the Aged's roll.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) added, winking, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) disappeared. '' Now, Mr. Pip, you know,'' said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``you and I understand one another.
<p/>We are in our private and personal capacities, and we have been engaged in a confidential transaction before to-day. Official sentiments are one thing.
<p/>I was so very nervous, that I had already lighted the Aged's sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it out.
<p/>I accidentally heard, yesterday morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``being in a certain place where I once took you,--even between you and me, it's as well not to mention names when avoidable--''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Much better not,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said I.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard there by chance, yesterday morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``that a certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and not unpossessed of portable property,--I don't know who it may really be,--we won't name this person--''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not necessary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said I. ''--Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good many people go, not always in gratification of their own inclinations, and not quite irrespective of the government expense--
<p/>'' In watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) face, I made quite a firework of the Aged's sausage, and greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick's; for which I apologized.
<p/>We are extra official. '' I cordially assented. '' <div class="bookquote">``I understand you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' --By disappearing from such place, and being no more heard of thereabouts.
<p/>From which,'' said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``conjectures had been raised and theories formed. I also heard that you at your chambers in Garden Court, Temple, had been watched, and might be watched again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><p/>'' By whom?'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't go into that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, evasively, <div class="bookquote">``it might clash with official responsibilities. I heard it, as I have in my time heard other curious things in the same place.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) took the toasting-fork and sausage from me as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) spoke, and set forth the Aged's breakfast neatly on a little tray.
<p/>Previous to placing it before him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) went into the Aged's room with a clean white cloth, and tied the same under the old gentleman's chin, and propped him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) up, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nightcap on one side, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) quite a rakish air.
<p/>I don't tell it you on information received. I heard it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) placed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) breakfast before him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with great care, and said, <div class="bookquote">``All right, ain't you, Aged P.?
<p/>As there seemed to be a tacit understanding that the Aged was not in a presentable state, and was therefore to be considered invisible, I made a pretence of being in complete ignorance of these proceedings.
<p/>This watching of me at my chambers -LRB-which I have once had reason to suspect-RRB-,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>I said to Wemmick when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) came back, <div class="bookquote">``is inseparable from the person to whom you have adverted; is it?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To which the cheerful Aged replied, <div class="bookquote">``All right, John, my boy, all right!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' '' Wemmick looked very serious. ''
<p/>I couldn't undertake to say that, of my own knowledge. I mean, I couldn't undertake to say it was at first.
<p/>As I saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could, and as I knew with thankfulness to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) how far out of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) way he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) went to say what he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did, I could not press him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
<p/>But I told him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) a question, subject to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) answering or not answering, as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) deemed right, and sure that his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) course would be right.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) paused in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) breakfast, and crossing his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) arms, and pinching his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shirt-sleeves -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) notion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) nodded to me once, to put my question.
<p/>But it either is, or it will be, or it's in great danger of being. '' '' You have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is Compeyson?''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gave me one last nod, and went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) breakfast.
<p/>Now,'' said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``questioning being over,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) emphasized and repeated for my guidance, <div class="bookquote">``I come to what I did, after hearing what I heard.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) answered with one other nod. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) living? '' One other nod. '' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) in London?'' '' I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went to Clarriker's to find Mr. Herbert.''
<p/>Without mentioning any names or going into any details, I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) to understand that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was aware of anybody--Tom, Jack, or Richard--being about the chambers, or about the immediate neighborhood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had better get Tom, Jack, or Richard out of the way while you were out of the way.''
<p/>'' And him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) you found?'' said I, with great anxiety. '' And him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) I found. <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) would be greatly puzzled what to do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) my opinion that it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard too far out of the way at present.
<p/>'' Mr. Pip, I'll tell you something. Under existing circumstances, there is no place like a great city when you are once in it.
<p/>Don't break cover too soon. Lie close. Wait till things slacken, before you try the open, even for foreign air. ''
<p/>I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) valuable advice, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) what Herbert had done? <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Herbert,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``after being all of a heap for half an hour, struck out a plan.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) mentioned to me as a secret, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) is courting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden
<p/>Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in a bow-window where he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) can see the ships sail up and down the river.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not personally,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I. The truth was, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Purser</b></font>) had objected to me as an expensive companion who did Herbert no good, and
<p/>that, when Herbert had first proposed to present me to her (<font color='blue'><b>Purser</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Purser</b></font>) had received the proposal with such very moderate warmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the state of the case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little time before I made her (<font color='blue'><b>Purser</b></font>) acquaintance.
<p/>When I had begun to advance Herbert's prospects by stealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerful philosophy: he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) affianced, for their part, had naturally not been very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews; and thus, although I was assured that I had risen in Clara's esteem, and although the young lady and I had long regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by Herbert, I had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>The house with the bow-window,'' said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``being by the river-side, down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and being kept, it seems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to let, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I think of that as a temporary tenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard?
<p/>Pa.. You are acquainted with the young lady, most probably? However, I did not trouble Wemmick with these particulars. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>Now, I thought very well of it, for three reasons I'll give you.
<p/>That is to say: Firstly. It's altogether out of all your beats, and is well away from the usual heap of streets great and small.
<p/>Secondly. Without going near it yourself, you could always hear of the safety of Tom, Jack, or Richard, through Mr. Herbert.
<p/>After a while and when it might be prudent, if you should want to slip Tom, Jack, or Richard on board a foreign packet-boat, there he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is--ready.
<p/>Thirdly. '' Much comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again and again, and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) to proceed. '' Well, sir!
<p/>Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will, and by nine o'clock last night he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) housed Tom, Jack, or Richard,--whichever
<p/>At the old lodgings it was understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was summoned to Dover, and, in fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) was taken down the Dover road and cornered out of it.
<p/>Now, another great advantage of all this is, that it was done without you, and when, if any one was concerning himself about your movements, you must be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged.
<p/>This diverts suspicion and confuses it; and for the same reason I recommended that, even if you came back last night, you should not go home.
<p/>it may be,--you and I don't want to know,--quite successfully. It brings in more confusion, and you want confusion. '' Wemmick, having finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) breakfast, here looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) watch, and began to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) coat on.
<p/>And now, Mr. Pip,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) hands still in the sleeves, <div class="bookquote">``I have probably done the most I can do; but if I can ever do more,--from a Walworth point of view, and in a strictly private and personal capacity,--I shall be glad to do it.
<p/>There can be no harm in your going here to-night, and seeing for yourself that all is well with Tom, Jack, or Richard, before you go home,--which is another reason for your not going home last night.
<p/>You are very welcome, I am sure, Mr. Pip'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) hands were now out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) sleeves, and I was shaking them; <div class="bookquote">``and let me finally impress one important point upon you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Here's the address. But, after you have gone home, don't go back here. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) hands upon my shoulders, and added in a solemn whisper:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Avail yourself of this evening to lay hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) portable property. You don't know what may happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>). Don't let anything happen to the portable property.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Quite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point, I forbore to try. '' Time's up,'' said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``and I must be off.
<p/>If you had nothing more pressing to do than to keep here till dark, that's what I should advise. You look very much worried, and it would do you good to have a perfectly quiet day with the Aged,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)'ll
<p/>be up presently,--and a little bit of--you remember the pig?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Well; and a little bit of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>).
<p/>That sausage you toasted was his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was in all respects a first-rater. Do try him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), if it is only for old acquaintance sake.
<p/>Good-bye, Aged Parent! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>in a cheery shout. '' All right, John; all right, my boy!'' piped the old man from within.
<p/>I soon fell asleep before Wemmick's fire, and the Aged and I enjoyed one another's society by falling asleep before it more or less all day.
<p/>We had loin of pork for dinner, and greens grown on the estate; and I nodded at the Aged with a good intention whenever I failed to do it drowsily.
<p/>When it was quite dark, I left the Aged preparing the fire for toast; and I inferred from the number of teacups, as well as from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) glances at the two little doors in the wall, that Miss Skiffins was expected.
<p/>Eight o'clock had struck before I got into the air, that was scented, not disagreeably, by the chips and shavings of the long-shore boat-builders, and mast, oar, and block makers.
<p/>All that water-side region of the upper and lower Pool below Bridge was unknown ground to me; and when I struck down by the river, I found that the spot I wanted was not where I had supposed it to be, and was anything but easy to find.
<p/>It was called Mill Pond Bank, Chinks's Basin; and I had no other guide to Chinks's Basin than the Old Green Copper Rope-walk.
<p/>It matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost myself among, what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces, what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide, what yards of ship-builders and ship-breakers, what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground, though for years off duty, what mountainous country of accumulated casks and timber, how many rope-walks that were not the Old Green Copper.
<p/>After several times falling short of my destination and as often overshooting it, I came unexpectedly round a corner, upon Mill Pond Bank.
<p/>It was a fresh kind of place, all circumstances considered, where the wind from the river had room to turn itself round; and there were two or three trees in it, and there was the stump of a ruined windmill, and there was the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,--whose long and narrow vista
<p/>Chapter XLVI I could trace in the moonlight, along a series of wooden frames set in the ground, that looked like superannuated haymaking-rakes which had grown old and lost most of their teeth.
<p/>Selecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank a house with a wooden front and three stories of bow-window -LRB-not bay-window, which is another thing-RRB-, I looked at the plate upon the door, and read there, Mrs. Whimple.
<p/>That being the name I wanted, I knocked, and an elderly woman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was immediately deposed, however, by Herbert, who silently led me into the parlor and shut the door.
<p/>It was an odd sensation to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) very familiar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room and region; and I found myself looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), much as I looked at the corner-cupboard with the glass and china, the shells upon the chimney-piece, and the colored engravings on the wall, representing the death of Captain Cook, a ship-launch, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) Majesty King George the Third in a state coachman's wig, leather-breeches, and top-boots, on the terrace at Windsor.
<p/>My dear girl is with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father; and if you'll wait till she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) comes down, I'll make you known to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and then we'll go upstairs.
<p/>'' All is well, Handel,'' said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) is quite satisfied, though eager to see you. That's her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><p/>I had become aware of an alarming growling overhead, and had probably expressed the fact in my countenance. '' I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is a sad old rascal,'' said Herbert, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``but I have never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).
<p/>Don't you smell rum? He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) is always at it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``At rum?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``and you may suppose how mild it makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) gout.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) persists, too, in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) room, and serving them out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) keeps them on shelves over his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) head, and will weigh them all.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) room must be like a chandler's shop. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar, and then died away.
<p/>A man with the gout in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right hand--and everywhere else--can't expect to get through a Double Gloucester without hurting himself.
<p/>'' What else can be the consequence,'' said Herbert, in explanation, <div class="bookquote">``if he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) will cut the cheese? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) seemed to have hurt himself very much, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) gave another furious roar.
<p/>To have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs. Whimple,'' said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``for of course people in general won't stand that noise.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>A curious place, Handel; isn't it? '' It was a curious place, indeed; but remarkably well kept and clean. ''
<p/>Mrs. Whimple,'' said Herbert, when I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) so, <div class="bookquote">``is the best of housewives, and I really do not know what my Clara would do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) motherly help.
<p/>For, Clara has no mother of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) own, Handel, and no relation in the world but old Gruffandgrim. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Surely that's not his (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) name, Herbert?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div><p/>But what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a girl who has no relations, and who can never bother herself or anybody else about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) family!''
<p/>Herbert had told me on former occasions, and now reminded me, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) first knew Miss Clara Barley when she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was completing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) education at an establishment at Hammersmith, and that on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) being recalled home to nurse her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had confided their affection to the motherly Mrs. Whimple, by whom it had been fostered and regulated with equal kindness and discretion, ever since.
<p/>It was understood that nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley, by reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject more psychological than Gout, Rum, and Purser's stores.
<p/>As we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barley's sustained growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling, the room door opened, and a very pretty, slight, dark-eyed girl of twenty or so came in with a basket in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand: whom Herbert tenderly relieved of the basket, and presented, blushing, as <div class="bookquote">``Clara.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) really was a most charming girl, and might have passed for a captive fairy, whom that truculent Ogre, Old Barley, had pressed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ogre</b></font>) service.
<p/>Look here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, showing me the basket, with a compassionate and tender smile, after we had talked a little; ``here's poor Clara's supper, served out every night.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``that's my name for him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) name is Mr. Barley. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>'' Here's her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) allowance of bread, and here's her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) slice of cheese, and here's her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) rum,--which
<p/>Two mutton-chops, three potatoes, some split peas, a little flour, two ounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black pepper.
<p/>I drink. This is Mr. Barley's breakfast for to-morrow, served out to be cooked. It's stewed up together, and taken hot, and it's a nice thing for the gout, I should think!
<p/>There was something so natural and winning in Clara's resigned way of looking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them out; and something so confiding, loving, and innocent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) modest manner of yielding herself to Herbert's embracing arm; and something so gentle in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>), so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinks's Basin, and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk, with Old Barley growling in the beam,--that I would not have undone the engagement between her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) and Herbert for all the money in the pocket-book
<p/>I was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) with pleasure and admiration, when suddenly the growl swelled into a roar again, and a frightful bumping noise was heard above, as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through the ceiling to come at us.
<p/>'' I had never opened. Upon this Clara said to Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``Papa wants me, darling!''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>and ran away. '' There is an unconscionable old shark for you!'' said Herbert.
<p/>'' What do you suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) wants now, Handel?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Something to drink?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>'' That's it! '' cried Herbert, as if I had made a guess of extraordinary merit.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) keeps his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table. Wait a moment, and you'll hear Clara lift him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) up to take some.
<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) goes!'' Another roar, with a prolonged shake at the end. '' Now,'' said Herbert, as it was succeeded by silence, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)'s drinking.
<p/>Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, as the growl resounded in the beam once more, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)'s down again on his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) back!''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>Clara returned soon afterwards, and Herbert accompanied me upstairs to see our charge.
<p/>As we passed Mr. Barley's door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was heard hoarsely muttering within, in a strain that rose and fell like wind, the following Refrain, in which I substitute good wishes for something quite the reverse:--
<p/>``Ahoy! Bless your eyes, here's old Bill Barley. Here's old Bill Barley, bless your eyes. Here's old Bill Barley on the flat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) back, by the Lord.
<p/>Lying on the flat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) back like a drifting old dead flounder, here's your old Bill Barley, bless your eyes.
<p/>In this strain of consolation, Herbert informed me the invisible Barley would commune with himself by the day and night together;
<p/>Often, while it was light, having, at the same time, one eye at a telescope which was fitted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) bed for the convenience of sweeping the river.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh and airy, and in which Mr. Barley was less audible than below, I found Provis comfortably settled.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) expressed no alarm, and seemed to feel none that was worth mentioning; but it struck me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) was softened,--indefinably, for I could not have said how, and could never afterwards recall how when I tried, but certainly.
<p/>The opportunity that the day's rest had given me for reflection had resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) respecting Compeyson.
<p/>For anything I knew, his (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) animosity towards the man might otherwise lead to his (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) seeking him (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) out and rushing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) own destruction.
<p/>Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) fire, I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) first of all whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) relied on Wemmick's judgment and sources of information?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, I have talked with Wemmick,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``and have come to tell you what caution he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) gave me and what advice.
<p/>I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison -LRB-whether from officers or prisoners I could not say-RRB-, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was under some suspicion, and that my chambers had been watched; how Wemmick had recommended his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) keeping close for a time, and my keeping away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>); and what Wemmick had said about getting him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) abroad.
<p/>I added, that of course, when the time came, I should go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), or should follow close upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), as might be safest in Wemmick's judgment.
<p/>What was to follow that I did not touch upon; neither, indeed, was I at all clear or comfortable about it in my own mind, now that I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) in that softer condition, and in declared peril for my sake.
<p/>As to altering my way of living by enlarging my expenses, I put it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) whether in our present unsettled and difficult circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it were no worse?
<p/>Ahoy! Bless you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Ay, ay, dear boy! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) answered, with a grave nod, <div class="bookquote">``Jaggers knows.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' This He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) would do nothing to make it a desperate venture, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had very little fear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) safety with such good help.
<p/>Herbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said that something had come into his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) thoughts arising out of Wemmick's suggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) coming back was a venture, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had always known it to be a venture. '' We are both good watermen, Handel, and could take him (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) down the river ourselves when the right time comes.
<p/>No boat would then be hired for the purpose, and no boatmen; that would save at least a chance of suspicion, and any chance is worth saving.
<p/>Never mind the season; don't you think it might be a good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs, and were in the habit of rowing up and down the river?
<p/>You fall into that habit, and then who notices or minds? Do it twenty or fifty times, and there is nothing special in your doing it
<p/>We agreed that it should be carried into execution, and that Provis should never recognize us if we came below Bridge, and rowed past Mill Pond Bank.
<p/>But we further agreed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) should pull down the blind in that part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) window which gave upon the east, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) saw us and all was right.
<p/>Our conference being now ended, and everything arranged, I rose to go; remarking to Herbert that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) and I had better not go home together, and that I would take half an hour's start of him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).
<p/>I don't like to leave you here,'' I said to Provis, <div class="bookquote">``though I cannot doubt your being safer here than near me.
<p/>the twenty-first or fifty-first. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Provis/Mr. Provis</b></font>)</div>I liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it. '' Good-bye!'' '' Dear boy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) answered, clasping my hands, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know when we may meet again, and I don't like good-bye.
<p/>Say good night!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good night! Herbert will go regularly between us, and when the time comes you may be certain I shall be ready.
<p/>We thought it best that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) should stay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) own rooms; and we left him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) on the landing outside his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) door, holding a light over the stair-rail to light us downstairs.
<p/>Looking back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), I thought of the first night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) return, when our positions were reversed, and when I little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) as it was now.
<p/>Old Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) door, with no appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease.
<p/>Good night, good night! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>When we got to the foot of the stairs, I asked Herbert whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had preserved the name of Provis.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) also explained that the utmost known of Mr. Campbell there was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) -LRB-Herbert-RRB- had Mr. Campbell consigned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>), and felt a strong personal interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) being well cared for, and living a secluded life.
<p/>So, when we went into the parlor where Mrs. Whimple and Clara were seated at work, I said nothing of my own interest in Mr. Campbell, but kept it to myself.
<p/>When I had taken leave of the pretty, gentle, dark-eyed girl, and of the motherly woman who had not outlived her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) honest sympathy with a little affair of true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper Rope-walk had grown quite a different place.
<p/>Old Barley might be as old as the hills, and might swear like a whole field of troopers, but there were redeeming youth and trust and hope enough in Chinks's Basin to fill it to overflowing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Green</b></font>) replied, certainly not, and that the lodger was Mr. Campbell. And then I thought of Estella, and of our parting, and went home very sadly.
<p/>The windows of the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis, were dark and still, and there was no lounger in Garden Court.
<p/>I walked past the fountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between me and my rooms, but I was quite alone.
<p/>All things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them. Herbert, coming to my bedside when he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) came in,--for I went straight to bed, dispirited and fatigued,--made the same report.
<p/>Opening one of the windows after that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was as solemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour.
<p/>It was soon done, and the boat was brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) within a minute or two.
<p/>Next day I set myself to get the boat. Then, I began to go out as for training and practice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert.
<p/>I was often out in cold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been out a few times.
<p/>It was Old London Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation.
<p/>But I knew well enough how to `shoot' the bridge after seeing it done, and so began to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to Erith.
<p/>The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were pulling a pair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw the blind towards the east come down.
<p/>Herbert was rarely there less frequently than three times in a week, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) never brought me a single word of intelligence that was at all alarming.
<p/>Still, I knew that there was cause for alarm, and I could not get rid of the notion of being watched.
<p/>Once received, it is a haunting idea; how many undesigning persons I suspected of watching me, it would be hard to calculate.
<p/>At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as the hours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge. In short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding.
<p/>Herbert had sometimes said to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) found it pleasant to stand at one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down, and to think that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towards Clara.
<p/>But I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch, and that any black mark on its surface might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) pursuers, going swiftly, silently, and surely, to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>).
<p/>If I had never known him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) out of Little Britain, and had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the Castle, I might have doubted him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>); not so for a moment, knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) as I did.
<p/>Chapter XLVII Some weeks passed without bringing any change. We waited for Wemmick, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) made no sign. My worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance, and I was pressed for money by more than one creditor.
<p/>Even I myself began to know the want of money -LRB-I mean of ready money in my own pocket-RRB-, and to relieve it by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash.
<p/>But I had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and plans.
<p/>Therefore, I had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) the unopened pocket-book by Herbert, to hold in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) own keeping, and I felt a kind of satisfaction--whether it was a false kind or a true, I hardly know--in not having profited by his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) generosity since his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) revelation of himself.
<p/>Fearful of having it confirmed, though it was all but a conviction, I avoided the newspapers, and begged Herbert -LRB-to whom I had confided the circumstances of our last interview-RRB- never to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) to me.
<p/>Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of hope that was rent and given to the winds, how do I know?
<p/>As the time wore on, an impression settled heavily upon me that Estella was married. Why did you who read this, commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own last year, last month, last week?
<p/>It was an unhappy life that I lived; and its one dominant anxiety, towering over all its other anxieties, like a high mountain above a range of mountains, never disappeared from my view.
<p/>Let me start from my bed as I would, with the terror fresh upon me that he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was discovered; let me sit listening, as I would with dread, for Herbert's returning step at night, lest it should be fleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news,--for all that, and much more to like purpose, the round of things went on.
<p/>Condemned to inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense, I rowed about in my boat, and waited, waited, waited, as I best could.
<p/>There were states of the tide when, having been down the river, I could not get back through the eddy-chafed arches and starlings of old London Bridge; then, I left my boat at a wharf near the Custom House, to be brought up afterwards to the Temple stairs.
<p/>I was not averse to doing this, as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the water-side people there.
<p/>Still, no new cause for fear arose. From this slight occasion sprang two meetings that I have now to tell of.
<p/>One afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at the wharf at dusk. I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide, and had turned with the tide.
<p/>It had been a fine bright day, but had become foggy as the sun dropped, and I had had to feel my way back among the shipping, pretty carefully.
<p/>As it was a raw evening, and I was cold, I thought I would comfort myself with dinner at once; and as I had hours of dejection and solitude before me if I went home to the Temple, I thought I would afterwards go to the play.
<p/>The theatre where Mr. Wopsle had achieved his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) questionable triumph was in that water-side neighborhood -LRB-it is nowhere now-RRB-, and to that theatre I resolved to go.
<p/>I was aware that Mr. Wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the Drama, but, on the contrary, had rather partaken of its decline.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) had been ominously heard of, through the play-bills, as a faithful Black, in connection with a little girl of noble birth, and a monkey.
<p/>And Herbert had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) as a predatory Tartar of comic propensities, with a face like a red brick, and an outrageous hat all over bells.
<p/>I dined at what Herbert and I used to call a geographical chop-house, where there were maps of the world in porter-pot rims on every half-yard of the tablecloths, and charts of gravy on every one of the knives,--to this day there is scarcely a single chop-house within the Lord Mayor's dominions which is not geographical,--and wore out the time in dozing over crumbs, staring at gas, and baking in a hot blast of dinners.
<p/>Both in going and returning, I had seen the signal in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) window, All well. By and by, I roused myself, and went to the play.
<p/>There, I found a virtuous boatswain in His (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) Majesty's service,--a most excellent man, though I could have wished his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) trousers not quite so tight in some places, and not quite so loose in others,--who knocked all the little men's hats over their eyes, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) was very generous and brave, and who wouldn't hear of anybody's paying taxes, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) was very patriotic.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) had a bag of money in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) pocket, like a pudding in the cloth, and on that property married a young person in bed-furniture, with great rejoicings; the whole population of Portsmouth -LRB-nine in number at the last census-RRB- turning out on the beach to rub their own hands and shake everybody else's, and sing <div class="bookquote">``Fill, fill!
<p/>A certain dark-complexioned Swab, however, who wouldn't fill, or do anything else that was proposed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>), and whose heart was openly stated -LRB-by the boatswain-RRB- to be as black as his (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) figure-head, proposed to two other Swabs to get all mankind into difficulties; which was so effectually done -LRB-the Swab family having considerable political influence-RRB- that it took half the evening to set things right, and then it was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white hat, black gaiters, and red nose, getting into a clock, with a gridiron, and listening, and coming out, and knocking everybody down from behind with the gridiron whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) couldn't confute with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mayor</b></font>) had overheard.
<p/>This led to Mr. Wopsle's -LRB-who had never been heard of before-RRB- coming in with a star and garter on, as a plenipotentiary of great power direct from the Admiralty, to say that the Swabs were all to go to prison on the spot, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) had brought the boatswain down the Union Jack, as a slight acknowledgment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) public services.
<p/>The boatswain, unmanned for the first time, respectfully dried his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) eyes on the Jack, and then cheering up, and addressing Mr. Wopsle as Your Honor, solicited permission to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) by the fin.
<p/>Mr. Wopsle, conceding his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) fin with a gracious dignity, was immediately shoved into a dusty corner, while everybody danced a hornpipe; and from that corner, surveying the public with a discontented eye, became aware of me.
<p/>The second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in the first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected Mr. Wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric countenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) hair, engaged in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying great cowardice when his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) gigantic master came home -LRB-very hoarse-RRB- to dinner.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) presently presented himself under worthier circumstances; for, the Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance,--on account of the parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) daughter's heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in a flour-sack, out of the first-floor window,--summoned a sententious Enchanter; and he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>), coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily, after an apparently violent journey, proved to be Mr. Wopsle in a high-crowned hat, with a necromantic work in one volume under his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) arm.
<p/>The business of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked at, sung at, butted at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of various colors, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) had a good deal of time on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) hands.
<p/>And I observed, with great surprise, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) devoted it to staring in my direction as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) were lost in amazement.
<p/>There was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr. Wopsle's eye, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) seemed to be turning so many things over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) mind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out.
<p/>I sat thinking of it long after he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) had ascended to the clouds in a large watch-case, and still I could not make it out.
<p/>I was still thinking of it when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) waiting for me near the door.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div>'' How do you do?'' said I, shaking hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) as we turned down the street together. '' I saw that you saw me.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is the strangest thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Wopsle, drifting into his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) lost look again; ``and yet I could swear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Saw you, Mr. Pip!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) returned. '' Yes, of course I saw you. But who else was there?'' <div class="bookquote">``Who else?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Whether I should have noticed him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) at first but for your being there,'' said Mr. Wopsle, going on in the same lost way, <div class="bookquote">``I can't be positive; yet I think I should.
<p/>Involuntarily I looked round me, as I was accustomed to look round me when I went home; for these mysterious words gave me a chill.
<p/>Becoming alarmed, I entreated Mr. Wopsle to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) meaning. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wopsle/Wopsle</b></font>)</div>'' '' Oh! He (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) can't be in sight,'' said Mr. Wopsle.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) went out before I went off. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) go. '' Having the reason that I had for being suspicious, I even suspected this poor actor.
<p/>I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission. Therefore I glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) as we walked on together, but said nothing.
<p/>I had a ridiculous fancy that he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) must be with you, Mr. Pip, till I saw that you were quite unconscious of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), sitting behind you there like a ghost.
<p/>My former chill crept over me again, but I was resolved not to speak yet, for it was quite consistent with his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) words that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) might be set on to induce me to connect these references with Provis.
<p/>'' '' Of course, I was perfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there. '' I dare say you wonder at me, Mr. Pip; indeed, I see you do.
<p/>But it is so very strange! You'll hardly believe what I am going to tell you. I could hardly believe it myself, if you told me.''
<p/>Mr. Pip, you remember in old times a certain Christmas Day, when you were quite a child, and I dined at Gargery's, and some soldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended?''
<p/>And you remember that there was a chase after two convicts, and that we joined in it, and that Gargery took you on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) back, and that I took the lead, and you kept up with me as well as you could?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. ``No, indeed. <div class="bookquote">``I remember it very well.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``I remember it all very well. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) thought,--except the last clause.
<p/>And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that there was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been severely handled and much mauled about the face by the other?''
<p/>And that the soldiers lighted torches, and put the two in the centre, and that we went on to see the last of them, over the black marshes, with the torchlight shining on their faces,--I am particular about that,--with the torchlight shining on their faces, when there was an outer ring of dark night all about us?''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I see it all before me.''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>'' '' Yes,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``I remember all that.''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then, Mr. Pip, one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight.
<p/>I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) over your shoulder.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Steady!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought. I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) then, <div class="bookquote">``Which of the two do you suppose you saw?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' The one who had been mauled,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) answered readily, <div class="bookquote">``and I'll swear I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>)! The more I think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), the more certain I am of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>).
<p/>This is very curious!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said I, with the best assumption I could put on of its being nothing more to me.
<p/>I cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation threw me, or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeyson's having been behind me <div class="bookquote">``like a ghost.
<p/>For if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) had ever been out of my thoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun, it was in those very moments when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) was closest to me; and to think that I should be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if I had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) out, and then had found him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) at my elbow.
<p/>I could not doubt, either, that he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) was there, because I was there, and that, however slight an appearance of danger there might be about us, danger was always near and active.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' '' Very curious indeed! '' '' I put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as, When did the man come in?
<p/>It was not until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for some time that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to identify him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had from the first vaguely associated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with me, and known him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as somehow belonging to me in the old village time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not tell me that; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw me, and over my shoulder he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw the man. How was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dressed?
<p/>I believed not too, for, although in my brooding state I had taken no especial notice of the people behind me, I thought it likely that a face at all disfigured would have attracted my attention.
<p/>When Mr. Wopsle had imparted to me all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) could recall or I extract, and when I had treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) to a little appropriate refreshment, after the fatigues of the evening, we parted.
<p/>Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) thought, in black. Was his (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) face at all disfigured? No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wopsle</b></font>) believed not. It was between twelve and one o'clock when I reached the Temple, and the gates were shut.
<p/>No one was near me when I went in and went home. Herbert had come in, and we held a very serious council by the fire.
<p/>But there was nothing to be done, saving to communicate to Wemmick what I had that night found out, and to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) that we waited for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hint.
<p/>As I thought that I might compromise him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) if I went too often to the Castle, I made this communication by letter.
<p/>I wrote it before I went to bed, and went out and posted it; and again no one was near me.
<p/>Herbert and I agreed that we could do nothing else but be very cautious. And we were very cautious indeed,--more cautious than before, if that were possible,--and
<p/>I for my part never went near Chinks's Basin, except when I rowed by, and then I only looked at Mill Pond Bank as I looked at anything else.
<p/>Chapter XLVIII The second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred about a week after the first.
<p/>I had again left my boat at the wharf below Bridge; the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon; and, undecided where to dine, I had strolled up into Cheapside, and was strolling along it, surely the most unsettled person in all the busy concourse, when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one overtaking me.
<p/>It was Mr. Jaggers's hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) passed it through my arm. '' As we are going in the same direction, Pip, we may walk together.
<p/>Well,'' I returned, glad for once to get the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) in cross-examination, <div class="bookquote">``I do not know, for I have not made up my mind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Where are you bound for?'' <div class="bookquote">``For the Temple, I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Don't you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers. '' <div class="bookquote">``You are going to dine?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers.
<p/>'' You don't mind admitting that, I suppose?'' '' No,'' I returned, <div class="bookquote">``I don't mind admitting that.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' And are not engaged?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind admitting also that I am not engaged.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>'' Then,'' said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``come and dine with me. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div><p/>I was going to excuse myself, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Wemmick's coming. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So I changed my excuse into an acceptance,--the few words I had uttered, serving for the beginning of either,--and
<p/>we went along Cheapside and slanted off to Little Britain, while the lights were springing up brilliantly in the shop windows, and the street lamp-lighters, scarcely finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the afternoon's bustle, were skipping up and down and running in and out, opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at the Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall.
<p/>At the office in Little Britain there was the usual letter-writing, hand-washing, candle-snuffing, and safe-locking , that closed the business of the day.
<p/>As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggers's fire, its rising and falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were playing a diabolical game at bo-peep with me; while the pair of coarse, fat office candles that dimly lighted Mr. Jaggers as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) wrote in a corner were decorated with dirty winding-sheets, as if in remembrance of a host of hanged clients.
<p/>We went to Gerrard Street, all three together, in a hackney-coach: And, as soon as we got there, dinner was served.
<p/>Although I should not have thought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much as a look to Wemmick's Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no objection to catching his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) eye now and then in a friendly way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) raised them from the table, and was as dry and distant to me as if there were twin Wemmicks, and this was the wrong one.
<p/>But it was not to be done. '' Did you send that note of Miss Havisham's to Mr. Pip, Wemmick? '' Mr. Jaggers asked, soon after we began dinner.
<p/>'' No, sir,'' returned Wemmick; <div class="bookquote">``it was going by post, when you brought Mr. Pip into the office. Here it is.
<p/>It's a note of two lines, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, handing it on, <div class="bookquote">``sent up to me by Miss Havisham on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) not being sure of your address.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) handed it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) principal instead of to me. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) tells me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) wants to see you on a little matter of business you mentioned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>).
<p/>You'll go down?'' '' Yes,'' said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly in those terms. '' When do you think of going down?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have an impending engagement,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, glancing at Wemmick, who was putting fish into the post-office, <div class="bookquote">``that renders me rather uncertain of my time.
<p/>If Mr. Pip has the intention of going at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick to Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) needn't write an answer, you know.
<p/>Receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, I settled that I would go to-morrow, and said so.
<p/>At once, I think. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>'' '' Wemmick drank a glass of wine, and looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers, but not at me.
<p/>'' So, Pip! Our friend the Spider,'' said Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``has played his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) cards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) has won the pool. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>It was as much as I could do to assent.
<p/>'' Hah! He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) is a promising fellow--in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) way--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) may not have it all his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) own way. The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has to be found out first.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Surely,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interrupted, with a burning face and heart, <div class="bookquote">``you do not seriously think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) is scoundrel enough for that, Mr. Jaggers?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) should turn to and beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) may possibly get the strength on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) side; if it should be a question of intellect, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) certainly will not.
<p/>It would be chance work to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such circumstances, because it's a toss-up between two results.''
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) should turn to, and beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>)-- <div class="bookquote">``I didn't say so, Pip. I am putting a case. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>May I ask what they are?''
<p/>'' A fellow like our friend the Spider,'' answered Mr. Jaggers, <div class="bookquote">``either beats or cringes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) may cringe and growl, or cringe and not growl; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) either beats or cringes.
<p/>So here's to Mrs. Bentley Drummle,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, taking a decanter of choicer wine from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) dumb-waiter, and filling for each of us and for himself, <div class="bookquote">``and may the question of supremacy be settled to the lady's satisfaction!
<p/>Ask Wemmick his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) opinion.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>'' Either beats or cringes,'' said Wemmick, not at all addressing himself to me. '' To the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman, it never will be.
<p/>Now, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, how slow you are to-day! '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) elbow when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), putting a dish upon the table.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) withdrew her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) hands from it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fell back a step or two, nervously muttering some excuse. And a certain action of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fingers, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) spoke, arrested my attention.
<p/>'' What's the matter?'' said Mr. Jaggers. '' Nothing. Only the subject we were speaking of,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``was rather painful to me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) stood looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) master, not understanding whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) was free to go, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had more to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) and would call her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) back if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) did go.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The action of her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) fingers was like the action of knitting. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) look was very intent. Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes and such hands on a memorable occasion very lately!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) dismissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) glided out of the room. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) remained before me as plainly as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) were still there.
<p/>I looked at those hands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and I compared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I knew of, and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband and a stormy life.
<p/>I looked again at those hands and eyes of the housekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over me when I last walked--not alone--in the ruined garden, and through the deserted brewery.
<p/>I thought how the same feeling had come back when I saw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stage-coach window; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like lightning, when I had passed in a carriage--not alone--through a sudden glare of light in a dark street.
<p/>I thought how one link of association had helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link, wanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by a chance swift from Estella's name to the fingers with their knitting action, and the attentive eyes.
<p/>Mr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella, and was not likely to have missed the sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) nodded when I said the subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round the wine again, and went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) dinner.
<p/>Only twice more did the housekeeper reappear, and then her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) stay in the room was very short, and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>).
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) hands were Estella's hands, and her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) eyes were Estella's eyes, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) had reappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor less sure that my conviction was the truth.
<p/>It was a dull evening, for Wemmick drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) wine, when it came round, quite as a matter of business,--just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) might have drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) salary when that came round,--and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) eyes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) chief, sat in a state of perpetual readiness for cross-examination.
<p/>As to the quantity of wine, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) post-office was as indifferent and ready as any other post-office for its quantity of letters.
<p/>From my point of view, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was the wrong twin all the time, and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth.
<p/>Even when we were groping among Mr. Jaggers's stock of boots for our hats, I felt that the right twin was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) way back; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down Gerrard Street in the Walworth direction, before I found that I was walking arm in arm with the right twin, and that the wrong twin had evaporated into the evening air.
<p/>And I felt absolutely certain that this woman was Estella's mother. We took our leave early, and left together. '' Well!'' said Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``that's over!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>)'s a wonderful man, without his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) living likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine with
<p/>him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>),--and I dine more comfortably unscrewed. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>I felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) so.
<p/>'' Wouldn't say it to anybody but yourself,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) answered. '' I know that what is said between you and me goes no further.
<p/>'' I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) had ever seen Miss Havisham's adopted daughter, Mrs. Bentley Drummle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) said no. To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke of the Aged and of Miss Skiffins.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) looked rather sly when I mentioned Miss Skiffins, and stopped in the street to blow his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) nose, with a roll of the head, and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness.
<p/>Wemmick,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``do you remember telling me, before I first went to Mr. Jaggers's private house, to notice that housekeeper?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Did I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) replied. '' Ah, I dare say I did. Deuce take me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) added, suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``I know I did.
<p/>I find I am not quite unscrewed yet. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' A wild beast tamed, you called her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>).'' '' And what do you call her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)?''
<p/>'' The same. How did Mr. Jaggers tame her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), Wemmick?'' '' That's his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) secret. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) has been with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) many a long year.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I wish you would tell me her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) story. I feel a particular interest in being acquainted with it. You know that what is said between you and me goes no further.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>Wemmick replied, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) story,--that is, I don't know all of it. But what I do know I'll tell you.
<p/>We are in our private and personal capacities, of course. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course. ''  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>'' A score or so of years ago, that woman was tried at the Old Bailey for murder, and was acquitted.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a very handsome young woman, and I believe had some gypsy blood in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Anyhow, it was hot enough when it was up, as you may suppose.''
<p/>Mr. Jaggers was for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),'' pursued Wemmick, with a look full of meaning, <div class="bookquote">``and worked the case in a way quite astonishing.
<p/>It was a desperate case, and it was comparatively early days with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) then, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) worked it to general admiration; in fact, it may almost be said to have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) worked it himself at the police-office, day after day for many days, contending against even a committal; and at the trial where he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) couldn't work it himself, sat under counsel, and--every one knew--put in all the salt and pepper.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was acquitted.'' '' The murdered person was a woman,--a woman a good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger.
<p/>They both led tramping lives, and this woman in Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick -LRB-as we say-RRB-, to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy.
<p/>The murdered woman,--more a match for the man, certainly, in point of years--was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath.
<p/>It was a case of jealousy. There had been a violent struggle, perhaps a fight. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was bruised and scratched and torn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked.
<p/>Now, there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman, and on the improbabilities of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) having been able to do it Mr. Jaggers principally rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) case.
<p/>You may be sure,'' said Wemmick, touching me on the sleeve, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) never dwelt upon the strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands then, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) sometimes does now.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I had told Wemmick of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) showing us her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wrists, that day of the dinner party. '' Well, sir!'' Wemmick went on; ``it happened--happened, don't you see?--that
<p/>this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) apprehension, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked much slighter than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) really was; in particular, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully contrived that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms had quite a delicate look.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had only a bruise or two about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),--nothing for a tramp,--but the backs of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands were lacerated, and the question was,
<p/>Now, Mr. Jaggers showed that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had struggled through a great lot of brambles which were not as high as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face; but which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not have got through and kept her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands out of; and bits of those brambles were actually found in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) skin and put in evidence, as well as the fact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken through, and to have little shreds of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dress and little spots of blood upon them here and there.
<p/>But the boldest point he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) made was this: it was attempted to be set up, in proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) jealousy, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the murder, frantically destroyed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child by this man--some three years old--to revenge herself upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way: <div class="bookquote">``We say these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and we show you the brambles.
<p/>Was it with finger-nails? You say they are marks of finger-nails, and you set up the hypothesis that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) destroyed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child.
<p/>For anything we know, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may have destroyed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child, and the child in clinging to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may have scratched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands.
<p/>You must accept all consequences of that hypothesis. What then? You are not trying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for the murder of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child; why don't you?
<p/>As to this case, if you will have scratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted for them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR.

(<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) service ever since?''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has since been taught one thing and another in the way of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) duties, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was tamed from the beginning.''

<p/>We exchanged a cordial good-night, and I went home, with new matter for my thoughts, though with no relief from the old.
<p/>Putting Miss Havisham's note in my pocket, that it might serve as my credentials for so soon reappearing at Satis House, in case her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) waywardness should lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) to express any surprise at seeing me, I went down again by the coach next day.
<p/>But I alighted at the Halfway House, and breakfasted there, and walked the rest of the distance; for I sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways, and to leave it in the same manner.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Nothing. I got your letter and destroyed it. Nothing. '' Chapter XLIX The best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet echoing courts behind the High Street.
<p/>The nooks of ruin where the old monks had once had their refectories and gardens, and where the strong walls were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables, were almost as silent as the old monks in their graves.
<p/>The cathedral chimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me, as I hurried on avoiding observation, than they had ever had before; so, the swell of the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music; and the rooks, as they hovered about the gray tower and swung in the bare high trees of the priory garden, seemed to call to me that the place was changed, and that Estella was gone out of it for ever.
<p/>An elderly woman, whom I had seen before as one of the servants who lived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard, opened the gate.
<p/>The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within, as of old, and I took it up and ascended the staircase alone.
<p/>Looking in at the door, after knocking in vain, I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sitting on the hearth in a ragged chair, close before, and lost in the contemplation of, the ashy fire.
<p/>Doing as I had often done, I went in, and stood touching the old chimney-piece, where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could see me when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>There was an air of utter loneliness upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), that would have moved me to pity though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I could charge her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with.
<p/>As I stood compassionating her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and thinking how, in the progress of time, I too had come to be a part of the wrecked fortunes of that house, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes rested on me.
<p/>Miss Havisham was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) own room, but was in the larger room across the landing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stared, and said in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``Is it real?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is I, Pip. Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday, and I have lost no time.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. Thank you.
<p/>As I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down, I remarked a new expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) face, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) were afraid of me.
<p/>I want,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you were last here, and to show you that I am not all stone.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>When I said some reassuring words, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) tremulous right hand, as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was going to touch me; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) recalled it again before I understood the action, or knew how to receive it.
<p/>'' '' But perhaps you can never believe, now, that there is anything human in my heart? '' You said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to do something useful and good.
<p/>Something that you would like done, is it not?'' '' Something that I would like done very much. '' '' What is it?
<p/>I had not got far into it, when I judged from her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) looks that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was thinking in a discursive way of me, rather than of what I said.
<p/>It seemed to be so; for, when I stopped speaking, many moments passed before she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) showed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was conscious of the fact.
<p/>Do you break off,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) asked then, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) former air of being afraid of me, <div class="bookquote">``because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>'' I began explaining to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) that secret history of the partnership. '' '' No, no,'' I answered, <div class="bookquote">``how can you think so, Miss Havisham!
<p/>I stopped because I thought you were not following what I said. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I was not,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) answered, putting a hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) head.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) set her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stick in the resolute way that sometimes was habitual to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), and looked at the fire with a strong expression of forcing herself to attend.
<p/>I went on with my explanation, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) how I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means, but how in this I was disappointed.
<p/>That part of the subject -LRB-I reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)-RRB- involved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for they were the weighty secrets of another.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Begin again, and let me look at something else. Stay! Now tell me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' So!'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), assenting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) head, but not looking at me.
<p/>'' And how much money is wanting to complete the purchase? '' I was rather afraid of stating it, for it sounded a large sum.
<p/>'' Nine hundred pounds. '' '' If I give you the money for this purpose, will you keep my secret as you have kept your own?''
<p/>'' Quite as faithfully.'' '' And your mind will be more at rest? '' <div class="bookquote">``Much more at rest. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you very unhappy now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) asked this question, still without looking at me, but in an unwonted tone of sympathy. I could not reply at the moment, for my voice failed me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) left arm across the head of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stick, and softly laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) forehead on it. '' I am far from happy, Miss Havisham; but I have other causes of disquiet than any you know of.
<p/>They are the secrets I have mentioned. '' After a little while, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) head, and looked at the fire again.
<p/>'' It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of unhappiness. Is it true?'' <div class="bookquote">``Too true.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend? Regarding that as done, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) presently rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) seat, and looked about the blighted room for the means of writing. '' You are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers?
<p/>This is an authority to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) to pay you that money, to lay out at your irresponsible discretion for your friend.
<p/>I keep no money here; but if you would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter, I will send it to you.''

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) read me what she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) had written; and it was direct and clear, and evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the receipt of the money.
<p/>I took the tablets from her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) hand, and it trembled again, and it trembled more as she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) took off the chain to which the pencil was attached, and put it in mine.
<p/>If you can ever write under my name, <div class="bookquote">``I forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do it!''
<p/>'' All this she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) did without looking at me. '' My name is on the first leaf. <div class="bookquote">``O Miss Havisham,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``I can do it now.
<p/>There have been sore mistakes; and my life has been a blind and thankless one; and I want forgiveness and direction far too much, to be bitter with you.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) face to me for the first time since she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) had averted it, and, to my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) knees at my feet; with her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) folded hands raised to me in the manner in which, when her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) poor heart was young and fresh and whole, they must often have been raised to heaven from her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) mother's side.
<p/>To see her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) white hair and her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) worn face kneeling at my feet gave me a shock through all my frame.
<p/>I entreated her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) to rise, and got my arms about her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) to help her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) up; but she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) only pressed that hand of mine which was nearest to her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) grasp, and hung her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) head over it and wept.
<p/>I had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) shed a tear before, and, in the hope that the relief might do her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) good, I bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) without speaking.

<p/>What have I done!'' '' If you mean, Miss Havisham, what have you done to injure me, let me answer. Very little.

<p/>That she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had done a grievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form that her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) wild resentment, spurned affection, and wounded pride found vengeance in, I knew full well.
<p/>But that, in shutting out the light of day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had shut out infinitely more; that, in seclusion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had secluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences; that, her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) mind, brooding solitary, had grown diseased, as all minds do and must and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker, I knew equally well.
<p/>And could I look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) without compassion, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) punishment in the ruin she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) profound unfitness for this earth on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was placed, in the vanity of sorrow which had become a master mania, like the vanity of penitence, the vanity of remorse, the vanity of unworthiness, and other monstrous vanities that have been curses in this world?
<p/>Until you spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) the other day, and until I saw in you a looking-glass that showed me what I once felt myself, I did not know what I had done.
<p/>'' What have I done! '' I knew not how to answer, or how to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>). '' What have I done!
<p/>What have I done! '' And so again, twenty, fifty times over, What had she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) done!

<p/>Not as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) is, but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was when she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) first came here? '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was seated on the ground, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) arms on the ragged chair, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) head leaning on them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) looked full at me when I said this, and replied, <div class="bookquote">``Go on.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whose child was Estella?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) answered in a low whisper and with caution: ``I had been shut up in these rooms a long time -LRB-I don't know how long
<p/>; you know what time the clocks keep here-RRB-, when I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) that I wanted a little girl to rear and love, and save from my fate.
<p/>I had first seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) when I sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) to lay this place waste for me; having read of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) in the newspapers, before I and the world parted.

<p/>One night he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) here asleep, and I called her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) Estella. '' <div class="bookquote">``Might I ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) age then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Two or three.
<p/>So convinced I was of that woman's being her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother, that I wanted no evidence to establish the fact in my own mind.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) herself knows nothing, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was left an orphan and I adopted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But, to any mind, I thought, the connection here was clear and straight.
<p/>What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview? I had succeeded on behalf of Herbert, Miss Havisham had told me all she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew of Estella, I had said and done what I could to ease her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) mind.
<p/>No matter with what other words we parted; we parted. Twilight was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air.
<p/>I called to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered, that I would not trouble her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) just yet, but would walk round the place before leaving.
<p/>For I had a presentiment that I should never be there again, and I felt that the dying light was suited to my last view of it.
<p/>By the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago, and on which the rain of years had fallen since, rotting them in many places, and leaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on end, I made my way to the ruined garden.
<p/>I went all round it; round by the corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle; round by the paths where Estella and I had walked.
<p/>Taking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little door at the garden end of it, and walked through.
<p/>I was going out at the opposite door,--not easy to open now, for the damp wood had started and swelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the threshold was encumbered with a growth of fungus,--when
<p/>A childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment of the slight action, and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging to the beam.
<p/>So strong was the impression, that I stood under the beam shuddering from head to foot before I knew it was a fancy,--though to be sure I was there in an instant.
<p/>The mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of this illusion, though it was but momentary, caused me to feel an indescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I had once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart.
<p/>Passing on into the front courtyard, I hesitated whether to call the woman to let me out at the locked gate of which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had the key, or first to go upstairs and assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as I had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>).
<p/>So cold, so lonely, so dreary all! I turned my head to look back. I took the latter course and went up.
<p/>I looked into the room where I had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), and I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) seated in the ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) back towards me.
<p/>In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly away, I saw a great flaming light spring up.
<p/>In the same moment I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) running at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire blazing all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), and soaring at least as many feet above her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) head as she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was high.
<p/>I had a double-caped great-coat on, and over my arm another thick coat. That I got them off, closed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) down, and got them over her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)
<p/>; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose, and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst, and all the ugly things that sheltered there; that we were on the ground struggling like desperate enemies, and that the closer I covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>), the more wildly she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) shrieked and tried to free herself,--that
<p/>I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the floor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight were floating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) faded bridal dress.
<p/>Then, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running away over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries at the door.
<p/>I still held her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) forcibly down with all my strength, like a prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was, or why we had struggled, or that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had been in flames, or that the flames were out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) garments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.
<p/>this occurred I knew through the result, but not through anything I felt, or thought, or knew I did. She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was insensible, and I was afraid to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) moved, or even touched.
<p/>Assistance was sent for, and I held her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) until it came, as if I unreasonably fancied -LRB-I think I did-RRB- that, if I let her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) go, the fire would break out again and consume her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>).
<p/>When I got up, on the surgeon's coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) with other aid, I was astonished to see that both my hands were burnt; for, I had no knowledge of it through the sense of feeling.
<p/>On examination it was pronounced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) had received serious hurts, but that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger lay mainly in the nervous shock.
<p/>By the surgeon's directions, her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) bed was carried into that room and laid upon the great table, which happened to be well suited to the dressing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) injuries.
<p/>When I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) again, an hour afterwards, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) lay, indeed, where I had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) stick, and had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) would lie one day.
<p/>Though every vestige of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) dress was burnt, as they told me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) still had something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) old ghastly bridal appearance; for, they had covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) to the throat with white cotton-wool, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) lay with a white sheet loosely overlying that, the phantom air of something that had been and was changed was still upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>).
<p/>I found, on questioning the servants, that Estella was in Paris, and I got a promise from the surgeon that he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) would write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) by the next post.
<p/>I took upon myself; intending to communicate with Mr. Matthew Pocket only, and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) liked about informing the rest.
<p/>Miss Havisham's family This I did next day, through Herbert, as soon as I returned to town. There was a stage, that evening, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) spoke collectedly of what had happened, though with a certain terrible vivacity.
<p/>Towards midnight she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) began to wander in her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) speech; and after that it gradually set in that she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) said innumerable times in a low solemn voice,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What have I done! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then, <div class="bookquote">``When she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) first came, I meant to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) from misery like mine. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) never changed the order of these three sentences, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) sometimes left out a word in one or other of them; never putting in another word, but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word.
<p/>As I could do no service there, and as I had, nearer home, that pressing reason for anxiety and fear which even her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) wanderings could not drive out of my mind, I decided, in the course of the night that I would return by the early morning coach, walking on a mile or so, and being taken up clear of the town.
<p/>At about six o'clock of the morning, therefore, I leaned over her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) and touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) lips with mine, just as they said, not stopping for being touched, ``Take the pencil and write under my name, 'I forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>).'
<p/>And then, <div class="bookquote">``Take the pencil and write under my name, 'I forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)!' ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Chapter L My hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night, and again in the morning.
<p/>My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, less severely, as high as the shoulder; it was very painful, but the flames had set in that direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse.
<p/>It was bandaged, of course, but much less inconveniently than my left hand and arm; those I carried in a sling; and I could only wear my coat like a cloak, loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck.
<p/>My right hand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the fingers. My hair had been caught by the fire, but not my head or face.
<p/>When Herbert had been down to Hammersmith and seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) came back to me at our chambers, and devoted the day to attending on me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was the kindest of nurses, and at stated times took off the bandages, and steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready, and put them on again, with a patient tenderness that I was deeply grateful for.
<p/>At first, as I lay quiet on the sofa, I found it painfully difficult, I might say impossible, to get rid of the impression of the glare of the flames, their hurry and noise, and the fierce burning smell.
<p/>If I dozed for a minute, I was awakened by Miss Havisham's cries, and by her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) running at me with all that height of fire above her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) head.
<p/>This pain of the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain I suffered; and Herbert, seeing that, did his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) utmost to hold my attention engaged.
<p/>That was made apparent by our avoidance of the subject, and by our agreeing--without agreement--to make my recovery of the use of my hands a question of so many hours, not of so many weeks.
<p/>Neither of us spoke of the boat, but we both thought of it. My first question when I saw Herbert had been of course, whether all was well down the river?
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) replied in the affirmative, with perfect confidence and cheerfulness, we did not resume the subject until the day was wearing away.
<p/>But then, as Herbert changed the bandages, more by the light of the fire than by the outer light, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) went back to it spontaneously.

<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) was up and down with Gruffandgrim all the evening.

<p/>I doubt if he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) can hold out long, though. What with rum and pepper,--and pepper and rum,--I should think his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) pegging must be nearly over.''

<p/>Whom did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) murder?''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>It was another and a stronger woman who was the victim, and there had been a struggle--in a barn.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was the woman brought in guilty?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was acquitted.--My poor Handel, I hurt you!'' <div class="bookquote">``It is impossible to be gentler, Herbert.

<p/>the right hand, which is a far easier job. You seem to breathe quickly.'' <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps I do, Herbert. Did the woman keep her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) oath?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, of course, my dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>returned Herbert, in a tone of surprise, and again bending forward to get a nearer look at me.
<p/>'' There comes the darkest part of Provis's life. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did.'' '' That is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) says it all.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, whether,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>pursued Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had used the child's mother ill, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had used the child's mother well, Provis doesn't say; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) described to us at this fireside, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) seems to have felt pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and forbearance towards her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>Therefore, fearing he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) should be called upon to depose about this destroyed child, and so be the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) death, he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) hid himself -LRB-much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) grieved for the child-RRB-, kept himself dark, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) says, out of the way and out of the trial, and was only vaguely talked of as a certain man called Abel, out of whom the jealousy arose.

<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I want to ask-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>boy</b></font>)</div>'' A moment, my dear boy, and I have done. It was clear last night that this barbed the point of Provis's animosity.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``and particularly, Herbert, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) told you when this happened?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Herbert,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, after a short silence, in a hurried way, <div class="bookquote">``can you see me best by the light of the window, or the light of the fire?''

(<font color='red'><b>boy</b></font>)</div>'' N-no, my dear boy,'' said Herbert, after taking time to examine me.
<p/>'' You are rather excited, but you are quite yourself.'' <div class="bookquote">``I know I am quite myself. And the man we have in hiding down the river, is Estella's Father.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Chapter LI What purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving Estella's parentage, I cannot say.
<p/>It will presently be seen that the question was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before me by a wiser head than my own.
<p/>But when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation, I was seized with a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter
<p/>I ought not to let it rest, but that I ought to see Mr. Jaggers, and come at the bare truth.
<p/>I really do not know whether I felt that I did this for Estella's sake, or whether I was glad to transfer to the man in whose preservation I was so much concerned some rays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded me.
<p/>down,--that Perhaps the latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth. Any way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard Street that night.
<p/>Herbert's representations that, if I did, I should probably be laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitive's safety would depend upon me, alone restrained my impatience.
<p/>On the understanding, again and again reiterated, that, come what would, I was to go to Mr. Jaggers to-morrow , I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have my hurts looked after, and to stay at home.
<p/>Early next morning we went out together, and at the corner of Giltspur Street by Smithfield, I left Herbert to go his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) way into the City, and took my way to Little Britain.
<p/>There were periodical occasions when Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick went over the office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put all things straight.
<p/>On these occasions, Wemmick took his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) books and papers into Mr. Jaggers's room, and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the outer office.
<p/>Finding such clerk on Wemmick's post that morning, I knew what was going on; but I was not sorry to have Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick together, as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing to compromise him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>).
<p/>Although I had sent Mr. Jaggers a brief account of the accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) all the details now; and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk to be less dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by the rules of evidence, than it had been before.
<p/>My appearance, with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders, favored my object. While I described the disaster, Mr. Jaggers stood, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) wont, before the fire.
<p/>Wemmick leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) chair, staring at me, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hands in the pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) trousers, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) pen put horizontally into the post.
<p/>The two brutal casts, always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings, seemed to be congestively considering whether they didn't smell fire at the present moment.
<p/>My narrative finished, and their questions exhausted, I then produced Miss Havisham's authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for Herbert.
<p/>Mr. Jaggers's eyes retired a little deeper into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head when I handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) the tablets, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) presently handed them over to Wemmick, with instructions to draw the check for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) signature.
<p/>While that was in course of being done, I looked on at Wemmick as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) wrote, and Mr. Jaggers, poising and swaying himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) well-polished boots, looked on at me.
<p/>I am sorry, Pip,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), as I put the check in my pocket, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had signed it, <div class="bookquote">``that we do nothing for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Havisham was good enough to ask me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned, <div class="bookquote">``whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) could do nothing for me, and I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) No.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Everybody should know his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) own business,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers. And I saw Wemmick's lips form the words ``portable property.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) No, if I had been you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Jaggers/Jaggers</b></font>)</div>said Mr Jaggers; <div class="bookquote">``but every man ought to know his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) own business best.
<p/>As I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at heart, I said, turning on Mr. Jaggers:--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Jaggers/Jaggers</b></font>)</div>'' '' Every man's business,'' said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me, <div class="bookquote">``is portable property. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' I did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir.
<p/>I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) to give me some information relative to her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) adopted daughter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) gave me all she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) possessed.'' <div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) boots and then straightening himself.
<p/>'' Hah! I don't think I should have done so, if I had been Miss Havisham. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) ought to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) own business best.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know more of the history of Miss Havisham's adopted child than Miss Havisham herself does, sir. I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) mother.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>Mr. Jaggers looked at me inquiringly, and repeated <div class="bookquote">``Mother?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) mother within these three days. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers.
<p/>'' And so have you, sir. And you have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) still more recently. '' <div class="bookquote">``Yes?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers. '' Perhaps I know more of Estella's history than even you do,'' said I.
<p/>A certain stop that Mr. Jaggers came to in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) manner--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was too self-possessed to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) manner, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) could not help its being brought to an indefinably attentive stop--assured me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) did not know who her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) father was.
<p/>This I had strongly suspected from Provis's account -LRB-as Herbert had repeated it-RRB- of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) having kept himself dark; which I pieced on to the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) himself was not Mr. Jaggers's client until some four years later, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) could have no reason for claiming his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) identity.
<p/>But, I could not be sure of this unconsciousness on Mr. Jaggers's part before, though I was quite sure of it now.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) father too. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' So! You know the young lady's father, Pip?'' said Mr. Jaggers. '' Yes,'' I replied, <div class="bookquote">``and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) name is Provis--from New South Wales.
<p/>It was the slightest start that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and the sooner checked, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did start, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made it a part of the action of taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief.
<p/>How Wemmick received the announcement I am unable to say; for I was afraid to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) just then, lest Mr. Jaggers's sharpness should detect that there had been some communication unknown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) between us.
<p/>And on what evidence, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) paused with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) handkerchief half way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) nose, <div class="bookquote">``does Provis make this claim?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) does not make it,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``and has never made it, and has no knowledge or belief that his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) daughter is in existence.
<p/>My reply was so unexpected, that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) pocket without completing the usual performance, folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) arms, and looked with stern attention at me, though with an immovable face.
<p/>Then I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservation that I left him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact knew from Wemmick.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Even Mr. Jaggers started when I said those words. '' '' '' For once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. I was very careful indeed as to that.
<p/>Nor did I look towards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had been for some time silently meeting Mr. Jaggers's look.
<p/>When I did at last turn my eyes in Wemmick's direction, I found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had unposted his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) pen, and was intent upon the table before him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>).
<p/>'' Hah!'' said Mr. Jaggers at last, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) moved towards the papers on the table. '' What item was it you were at,
<p/>But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a passionate, almost an indignant appeal, to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) to be more frank and manly with me.
<p/>I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) of the false hopes into which I had lapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had made: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits.
<p/>I represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), in return for the confidence I had just now imparted.
<p/>I said that I did not blame him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), or suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), or mistrust him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), but I wanted assurance of the truth from him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>).
<p/>And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) asked me why I wanted it, and why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), little as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) cared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long, and that although I had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), and must live a bereaved life, whatever concerned her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) was still nearer and dearer to me than anything else in the world.
<p/>And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite still and silent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned to Wemmick, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Wemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentle heart.
<p/>I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all the innocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business life.
<p/>And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers, and to represent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) that, all circumstances considered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) ought to be more open with me!
<p/>I have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe.
<p/>At first, a misgiving crossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) employment; but it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something like a smile, and Wemmick become bolder.
<p/>Wemmick, when Mr. Pip came in? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' What's all this?'' said Mr. Jaggers. '' You with an old father, and you with pleasant and playful ways?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Jaggers/Jaggers/MR. JAGGERS</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Jaggers, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hand upon my arm, and smiling openly, ``this man must be the most cunning impostor in all London.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Wemmick. '' If I don't bring 'em here, what does it matter?'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder.
<p/>'' I think you're another. '' Again they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently still distrustful that the other was taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) in.
<p/>'' You with a pleasant home?'' said Mr. Jaggers. '' Since it don't interfere with business,'' returned Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``let it be so.
<p/>Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldn't wonder if you might be planning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of these days, when you're tired of all this work.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mr. Jaggers nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) head retrospectively two or three times, and actually drew a sigh. '' But now about this other matter.
<p/>I'll put a case to you. Mind! I admit nothing. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) expressly said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) admitted nothing.
<p/>Put the case that a woman, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child concealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) legal adviser, on his (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) representing to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) must know, with an eye to the latitude of his (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) defence, how the fact stood about that child.
<p/>Put the case that, at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) held a trust to find a child for an eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up.''
<p/>``Put the case that he (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all he (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) saw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain destruction.
<p/>Put the case that he (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) often saw children solemnly tried at a criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the case that he (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported, neglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growing up to be hanged.
<p/>Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>) saw in his (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>) daily business life he (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>) had reason to look upon as so much spawn, to develop into the fish that were to come to his (<font color='blue'><b>hangman</b></font>) net,--to be prosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow.
<p/>``Put the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of the heap who could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared make no stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had this power: <div class="bookquote">``I know what you did, and how you did it.

<p/>Standing by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that the odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times: with this difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not to say conscious, of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to the other.
<p/>For this reason, I suppose, they were now inflexible with one another; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and Wemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for a moment.
<p/>Mr. Jaggers did the same. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I had never seen them on such ill terms; for generally they got on very well indeed together.
<p/>But they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of Mike, the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) nose on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) sleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance within those walls.
<p/>This individual, who, either in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) own person or in that of some member of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) family, seemed to be always in trouble -LRB-which in that place meant Newgate-RRB-, called to announce that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) eldest daughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Mike</b></font>) imparted this melancholy circumstance to Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers standing magisterially before the fire and taking no share in the proceedings, Mike's eye happened to twinkle with a tear.
<p/>'' What are you about?'' demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation. '' What do you come snivelling here for?'' <div class="bookquote">``I didn't go to do it, Mr. Wemmick.

<p/>What do you mean by it?'' '' A man can't help his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feelings, Mr. Wemmick,'' pleaded Mike. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) what?'' demanded Wemmick, quite savagely.

<p/>I went, with my check in my pocket, to Miss Skiffins's brother, the accountant; and Miss Skiffins's brother, the accountant, going straight to Clarriker's and bringing Clarriker to me, I had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement.
<p/>It was the only good thing I had done, and the only completed thing I had done, since I was first apprised of my great expectations.
<p/>Clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the House were steadily progressing, that he (<font color='blue'><b>accountant</b></font>) would now be able to establish a small branch-house in the East which was much wanted for the extension of the business, and that Herbert in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) new partnership capacity would go out and take charge of it, I found that I must have prepared for a separation from my friend, even though my own affairs had been more settled.
<p/>And now, indeed, I felt as if my last anchor were loosening its hold, and I should soon be driving with the winds and waves.
<p/>But there was recompense in the joy with which Herbert would come home of a night and tell me of these changes,
<p/>little imagining that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) told me no news, and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting Clara Barley to the land of the Arabian Nights, and of me going out to join them -LRB-with a caravan of camels, I believe-RRB-, and of our all going up the Nile and seeing wonders.
<p/>Without being sanguine as to my own part in those bright plans, I felt that Herbert's way was clearing fast, and that old Bill Barley had but to stick to his (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) pepper and rum, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) daughter would soon be happily provided for.
<p/>My left arm, though it presented no bad symptoms, took, in the natural course, so long to heal that I was still unable to get a coat on.
<p/>On a Monday morning, when Herbert and I were at breakfast, I received the following letter from Wemmick by the post.
<p/>We had now got into the month of March. My right arm was tolerably restored; disfigured, but fairly serviceable. '' Walworth.
<p/>Early in the week, or say Wednesday, you might do what you know of, if you felt disposed to try it.
<p/>When I had shown this to Herbert and had put it in the fire--but not before we had both got it by heart--we considered what to do.
<p/>Burn this as soon as read. Now burn. '' For, of course my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view.
<p/>I have thought it over again and again,'' said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``and I think I know a better course than taking a Thames waterman.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>Take Startop. A good fellow, a skilled hand, fond of us, and enthusiastic and honorable. '' I had thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) more than once.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) suppose it a mere freak, but a secret one, until the morning comes: then let him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) know that there is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away.
<p/>'' But how much would you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>), Herbert?'' <div class="bookquote">``It is necessary to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) very little. You go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>It had seemed to me, in the many anxious considerations I had given the point, almost indifferent what port we made for,--Hamburg,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Rotterdam, Antwerp,--the place signified little, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was out of England. Any foreign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do.
<p/>I had always proposed to myself to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) well down the river in the boat; certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place for search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot.
<p/>As foreign steamers would leave London at about the time of high-water, our plan would be to get down the river by a previous ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spot until we could pull off to one.
<p/>The time when one would be due where we lay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if we made inquiries beforehand.
<p/>We found that a steamer for Hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed our thoughts chiefly to that vessel.
<p/>But we noted down what other foreign steamers would leave London with the same tide, and we satisfied ourselves that we knew the build and color of each.
<p/>We then separated for a few hours: I, to get at once such passports as were necessary; Herbert, to see Startop at his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) lodgings.
<p/>We both did what we had to do without any hindrance, and when we met again at one o'clock reported it done.
<p/>Herbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately after breakfast to pursue our investigations. I, for my part, was prepared with passports; Herbert had seen Startop, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was more than ready to join.
<p/>Those two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer; our charge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not our object, we should make way enough.
<p/>We arranged that Herbert should not come home to dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) should not go there at all to-morrow evening, Tuesday; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) should prepare Provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house, on Wednesday, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) saw us approach, and not sooner; that all the arrangements with him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) should be concluded that Monday night; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) should be communicated with no more in any way, until we took him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) on board.
<p/>On opening the outer door of our chambers with my key, I found a letter in the box, directed to me; a very dirty letter, though not ill-written.
<p/>These precautions well understood by both of us, I went home. It had been delivered by hand -LRB-of course, since I left home-RRB-, and its contents were these:--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you are not afraid to come to the old marshes to-night or to-morrow night at nine, and to come to the little sluice-house by the limekiln, you had better come.
<p/>If you want information regarding your uncle Provis, you had much better come and tell no one, and lose no time.
<p/>You must come alone. Bring this with you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange letter.
<p/>And the worst was, that I must decide quickly, or I should miss the afternoon coach, which would take me down in time for to-night.
<p/>What to do now, I could not tell. To-morrow night I could not think of going, for it would be too close upon the time of the flight.
<p/>And again, for anything I knew, the proffered information might have some important bearing on the flight itself. If I had had ample time for consideration, I believe I should still have gone.
<p/>Having hardly any time for consideration,--my watch showing me that the coach started within half an hour,--I resolved to go. I should certainly not have gone, but for the reference to my Uncle Provis.
<p/>It is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of almost any letter, in a violent hurry, that I had to read this mysterious epistle again twice, before its injunction to me to be secret got mechanically into my mind.
<p/>Yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of way, I left a note in pencil for Herbert, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) that as I should be so soon going away, I knew not for how long, I had decided to hurry down and back, to ascertain for myself how Miss Havisham was faring.
<p/>I had then barely time to get my great-coat, lock up the chambers, and make for the coach-office by the short by-ways.
<p/>If I had taken a hackney-chariot and gone by the streets, I should have missed my aim; going as I did, I caught the coach just as it came out of the yard.
<p/>That, coming on Wemmick's letter and the morning's busy preparation, turned the scale. I was the only inside passenger, jolting away knee-deep in straw, when I came to myself.
<p/>For I really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter; it had so bewildered me, ensuing on the hurry of the morning.
<p/>The morning hurry and flutter had been great; for, long and anxiously as I had waited for Wemmick, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hint had come like a surprise at last.
<p/>And now I began to wonder at myself for being in the coach, and to doubt whether I had sufficient reason for being there, and to consider whether I should get out presently and go back, and to argue against ever heeding an anonymous communication, and, in short, to pass through all those phases of contradiction and indecision to which I suppose very few hurried people are strangers.
<p/>I reasoned as I had reasoned already without knowing it,--if that be reasoning,--in case any harm should befall him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) through my not going, how could I ever forgive myself!
<p/>It was dark before we got down, and the journey seemed long and dreary to me, who could see little of it inside, and who could not go outside in my disabled state.
<p/>Still, the reference to Provis by name mastered everything. Avoiding the Blue Boar, I put up at an inn of minor reputation down the town, and ordered some dinner.
<p/>While it was preparing, I went to Satis House and inquired for Miss Havisham; she (<font color='blue'><b>Havisham</b></font>) was still very ill, though considered something better.
<p/>My inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house, and I dined in a little octagonal common-room, like a font.
<p/>As I was not able to cut my dinner, the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for me.
<p/>This bringing us into conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was so good as to entertain me with my own story,--of course with the popular feature that Pumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes.
<p/>'' Do you know the young man?'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``Know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>repeated the landlord. '' Ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was--no height at all.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ay, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes back,''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>said the landlord, ``to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) great friends, now and again, and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ever come back to this neighborhood?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``What man is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Him</b></font>)</div>'' Him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that I speak of,'' said the landlord.
<p/>'' Mr. Pumblechook. '' <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) ungrateful to no one else?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) would be, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) could,'' returned the landlord, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) can't.
<p/>And why? Because Pumblechook done everything for him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Does Pumblechook say so?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Say so! ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>replied the landlord. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) han't no call to say so.''
<p/>'' But does he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) say so?'' <div class="bookquote">``It would turn a man's blood to white wine winegar to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tell of it, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said the landlord.
<p/>I thought, <div class="bookquote">``Yet Joe, dear Joe, you never tell of it. Long-suffering and loving Joe, you never complain. Nor you, sweet-tempered Biddy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your appetite's been touched like by your accident,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the landlord, glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat. <div class="bookquote">``Try a tenderer bit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, thank you,'' I replied, turning from the table to brood over the fire. '' I can eat no more.
<p/>Please take it away. '' I had never been struck at so keenly, for my thanklessness to Joe, as through the brazen impostor Pumblechook.
<p/>The falser he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>), the truer Joe; the meaner he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>), the nobler Joe. My heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as I mused over the fire for an hour or more.
<p/>The striking of the clock aroused me, but not from my dejection or remorse, and I got up and had my coat fastened round my neck, and went out.
<p/>I had previously sought in my pockets for the letter, that I might refer to it again; but I could not find it, and was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of the coach.
<p/>I knew very well, however, that the appointed place was the little sluice-house by the limekiln on the marshes, and the hour nine.
<p/>It was a dark night, though the full moon rose as I left the enclosed lands, and passed out upon the marshes.
<p/>Towards the marshes I now went straight, having no time to spare. Chapter LIII Beyond their dark line there was a ribbon of clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon.
<p/>In a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had ascended out of that clear field, in among the piled mountains of cloud. There was a melancholy wind, and the marshes were very dismal.
<p/>A stranger would have found them insupportable, and even to me they were so oppressive that I hesitated, half inclined to go back.
<p/>But I knew them well, and could have found my way on a far darker night, and had no excuse for returning, being there.
<p/>The direction that I took was not that in which my old home lay, nor that in which we had pursued the convicts.
<p/>My back was turned towards the distant Hulks as I walked on, and, though I could see the old lights away on the spits of sand, I saw them over my shoulder.
<p/>I knew the limekiln as well as I knew the old Battery, but they were miles apart; so that, if a light had been burning at each point that night, there would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright specks.
<p/>At first, I had to shut some gates after me, and now and then to stand still while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway arose and blundered down among the grass and reeds.
<p/>So, having come there against my inclination, I went on against it. But after a little while I seemed to have the whole flats to myself.
<p/>The lime was burning with a sluggish stifling smell, but the fires were made up and left, and no workmen were visible.
<p/>It lay directly in my way, and had been worked that day, as I saw by the tools and barrows that were lying about.
<p/>Coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavation,--for the rude path lay through it,--I saw a light in the old sluice-house.
<p/>It was another half-hour before I drew near to the kiln. Hard by was a small stone-quarry. I quickened my pace, and knocked at the door with my hand.
<p/>Waiting for some reply, I looked about me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken, and how the house--of wood with a tiled roof--would not be proof against the weather much longer, if it were so even now, and how the mud and ooze were coated with lime, and how the choking vapor of the kiln crept in a ghostly way towards me.
<p/>Still there was no answer, and I knocked again. No answer still, and I tried the latch. It rose under my hand, and the door yielded.
<p/>Looking in, I saw a lighted candle on a table, a bench, and a mattress on a truckle bedstead. As there was a loft above, I called, <div class="bookquote">``Is there any one here?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>but no voice answered. Then I looked at my watch, and, finding that it was past nine, called again, <div class="bookquote">``Is there any one here?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>There being still no answer, I went out at the door, irresolute what to do. It was beginning to rain fast.
<p/>Seeing nothing save what I had seen already, I turned back into the house, and stood just within the shelter of the doorway, looking out into the night.
<p/>While I was considering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back, or the candle would not be burning, it came into my head to look if the wick were long.
<p/>I turned round to do so, and had taken up the candle in my hand, when it was extinguished by some violent shock; and the next thing I comprehended was, that I had been caught in a strong running noose, thrown over my head from behind.
<p/>'' Now,'' said a suppressed voice with an oath, <div class="bookquote">``I've got you!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What is this? '' I cried, struggling. ''
<p/>Not only were my arms pulled close to my sides, but the pressure on my bad arm caused me exquisite pain.
<p/>Sometimes, a strong man's hand, sometimes a strong man's breast, was set against my mouth to deaden my cries, and with a hot breath always close to me, I struggled ineffectually in the dark, while I was fastened tight to the wall.
<p/>Who is it? Help, help, help! '' '' And now,'' said the suppressed voice with another oath, <div class="bookquote">``call out again, and I'll make short work of you!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm, bewildered by the surprise, and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in execution, I desisted, and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little.
<p/>But, it was bound too tight for that. I felt as if, having been burnt before, it were now being boiled.
<p/>The sudden exclusion of the night, and the substitution of black darkness in its place, warned me that the man had closed a shutter.
<p/>I strained my sight upon the sparks that fell among the tinder, and upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breathed and breathed, match in hand, but I could only see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips, and the blue point of the match; even those but fitfully.
<p/>After groping about for a little, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found the flint and steel he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted, and began to strike a light. The tinder was damp,--no wonder there,--and one after another
<p/>As the sparks fell thick and bright about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I could see his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, and touches of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, and could make out that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was seated and bending over the table; but nothing more.
<p/>Presently I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blue lips again, breathing on the tinder, and then a flare of light flashed up, and showed me Orlick.
<p/>the sparks died out. The man was in no hurry, and struck again with the flint and steel. Whom I had looked for, I don't know.
<p/>I had not looked for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed, and I kept my eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put the candle away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on the table, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could see me, and sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms folded on the table and looked at me.
<p/>I made out that I was fastened to a stout perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall,--a fixture there,--the means of ascent to the loft above.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation, and dropped the match, and trod it out. '' Now,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), when we had surveyed one another for some time, <div class="bookquote">``I've got you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unbind me. Let me go!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">``I'll let you go. I'll let you go to the moon , I'll let you go to the stars.
<p/>All in good time. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why have you lured me here?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't you know?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), with a deadly look. ''
<p/>Why have you set upon me in the dark? '' '' Because I mean to do it all myself. One keeps a secret better than two.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms folded on the table, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head at me and hugging himself, had a malignity in it that made me tremble.
<p/>As I watched him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand into the corner at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side, and took up a gun with a brass-bound stock.
<p/>O you enemy, you enemy! '' '' Do you know this?'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), making as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would take aim at me.
<p/>'' Do you know where you saw it afore? Speak, wolf!'' '' Yes,'' I answered. '' You cost me that place.
<p/>You did. Speak!'' '' What else could I do?'' '' You did that, and that would be enough, without more. How dared you to come betwixt me and a young woman I liked?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When did I?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' When didn't you? It was you as always give Old Orlick a bad name to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``You gave it to yourself; you gained it for yourself.
<p/>I could have done you no harm, if you had done yourself none.''  (<font color='red'><b>a liar</b></font>)</div>'' You're a liar. And you'll take any pains, and spend any money, to drive me out of this country, will you?
<p/>'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>), repeating my words to Biddy in the last interview I had with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). '' Now, I'll tell you a piece of information.
<p/>It was never so well worth your while to get me out of this country as it is to-night. Ah! If it was all your money twenty times told, to the last brass farden!''
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) heavy hand at me, with his (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) mouth snarling like a tiger's, I felt that it was true.
<p/>I'm a going,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>), bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) fist down upon the table with a heavy blow, and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force,--<div class="bookquote">``I'm
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) leaned forward staring at me, slowly unclenched his (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) hand and drew it across his (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) mouth as if his (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) mouth watered for me, and sat down again.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>What are you going to do to me?'' '' a going to have your life!'' '' You was always in Old Orlick's way since ever you was a child.
<p/>You goes out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) way this present night. He (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>)'ll have no more on you. You're dead. '' I felt that I had come to the brink of my grave.
<p/>More than that,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>), folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) arms on the table again, <div class="bookquote">``I won't have a rag of you, I won't have a bone of you, left on earth.
<p/>I'll put your body in the kiln,--I'd carry two such to it, on my Shoulders,--and, let people suppose what they may of you, they shall never know nothing.
<p/>For a moment I looked wildly round my trap for any chance of escape; but there was none. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' My mind, with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences of such a death.
<p/>Estella's father would believe I had deserted him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), would be taken, would die accusing me; even Herbert would doubt me, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) compared the letter I had left for him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) with the fact that I had called at Miss Havisham's gate for only a moment; Joe and Biddy would never know how sorry I had been that night, none would ever know what I had suffered, how true I had meant to be, what an agony I had passed through.
<p/>The death close before me was terrible, but far more terrible than death was the dread of being misremembered after death.
<p/>And so quick were my thoughts, that I saw myself despised by unborn generations,--Estella's children, and their children,--while the wretch's words were yet on his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) lips.
<p/>'' Now, wolf,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``afore I kill you like any other beast,--which is wot I mean to do and wot I have tied you up for,--I'll
<p/>It had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again; though few could know better than I, the solitary nature of the spot, and the hopelessness of aid.
<p/>have a good look at you and a good goad at you. O you enemy! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But as he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) sat gloating over me, I was supported by a scornful detestation of him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) that sealed my lips.
<p/>Above all things, I resolved that I would not entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), and that I would die making some last poor resistance to him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).
<p/>Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of men were in that dire extremity; humbly beseeching pardon, as I did, of Heaven; melted at heart, as I was, by the thought that I had taken no farewell, and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to me, or could explain myself to them, or ask for their compassion on my miserable errors,--still, if I could have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), even in dying, I would have done it.
<p/>Around his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) neck was slung a tin bottle, as I had often seen his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) meat and drink slung about him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) in other days.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) brought the bottle to his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) lips, and took a fiery drink from it; and I smelt the strong spirits that I saw flash into his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had been drinking, and his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) eyes were red and bloodshot. <div class="bookquote">``Wolf! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>), folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) arms again, <div class="bookquote">``Old Orlick's a going to tell you somethink.
<p/>Again my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had exhausted the whole subject of the attack upon my sister, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) illness, and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) death, before his (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) slow and hesitating speech had formed these words.
<p/>It was you as did for your shrew sister. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' It was you, villain,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``I tell you it was your doing,--I
<p/>tell you it was done through you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) retorted, catching up the gun, and making a blow with the stock at the vacant air between us.
<p/>I left her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) for dead, and if there had been a limekiln as nigh her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) as there is now nigh you, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) shouldn't have come to life again.
<p/>'' I come upon her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) from behind, as I come upon you to-night. I giv' it her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)! But it warn't Old Orlick
<p/>as did it; it was you. You was favored, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) was bullied and beat. Old Orlick bullied and beat, eh?
<p/>Now you pays for it. You done it; now you pays for it. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) drank again, and became more ferocious.
<p/>I saw by his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) tilting of the bottle that there was no great quantity left in it. I distinctly understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) was working himself up with its contents to make an end of me.
<p/>I knew that when I was changed into a part of the vapor that had crept towards me but a little while before, like my own warning ghost, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) would do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had done in my sister's case,--make all haste to the town, and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses.
<p/>My rapid mind pursued him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) to the town, made a picture of the street with him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) in it, and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and the white vapor creeping over it, into which I should have dissolved.
<p/>It was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years while he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) said a dozen words, but that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) did say presented pictures to me, and not mere words.
<p/>In the excited and exalted state of my brain, I could not think of a place without seeing it, or of persons without seeing them.
<p/>It is impossible to overstate the vividness of these images, and yet I was so intent, all the time, upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) himself,--who would not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring!--that
<p/>I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life. I knew of the slightest action of his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) fingers.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) had drunk this second time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) rose from the bench on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) sat, and pushed the table aside.
<p/>Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) took up the candle, and, shading it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) murderous hand so as to throw its light on me, stood before me, looking at me and enjoying the sight.
<p/>'' Wolf, I'll tell you something more. It was Old Orlick as you tumbled over on your stairs that night. ''
<p/>I saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps. I saw the shadows of the heavy stair-rails, thrown by the watchman's lantern on the wall.
<p/>I saw the rooms that I was never to see again; here, a door half open; there, a door closed; all the articles of furniture around.
<p/>You and her (<font color='blue'><b>Wolf</b></font>) have pretty well hunted me out of this country, so far as getting a easy living in it goes, and I've took up with new companions, and new masters.
<p/>'' And why was Old Orlick there? I'll tell you something more, wolf. Some of 'em writes my letters when I wants 'em wrote,--do
<p/>I've had a firm mind and a firm will to have your life, since you was down here at your sister's burying.
<p/>you mind?--writes my letters, wolf! They writes fifty hands; they're not like sneaking you, as writes but one. I han't seen a way to get you safe, and I've looked arter you to know your ins and outs.
<p/>For, says Old Orlick to himself, `Somehow or another I'll have him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>)!' What! When I looks for you, I finds your uncle Provis, eh?
<p/>Provis in his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) rooms, the signal whose use was over, pretty Clara, the good motherly woman, old Bill Barley on his (<font color='blue'><b>Barley</b></font>) back, all drifting by, as on the swift stream of my life fast running out to sea!
<p/>'' Mill Pond Bank, and Chinks's Basin, and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk, all so clear and plain! '' You with a uncle too!
<p/>Why, I know'd you at Gargery's when you was so small a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and thumb and chucked you away dead -LRB-as I'd thoughts o' doing, odd times, when I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday-RRB-, and you hadn't found no uncles then.
<p/>But when Old Orlick come for to hear that your uncle Provis had most like wore the leg-iron wot Old Orlick had picked up, filed asunder, on these meshes ever so many year ago, and wot he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) kep by him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) dropped your sister with it, like a bullock, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) means to drop you--hey?--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) come for to hear that--hey?
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) savage taunting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) flared the candle so close at me that I turned my face aside to save it from the flame.
<p/>Old Orlick knowed you was burnt, Old Orlick knowed you was smuggling your uncle Provis away, Old Orlick's a match for you and
<p/>No, not you! '' <div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) cried, laughing, after doing it again, <div class="bookquote">``the burnt child dreads the fire! know'd you'd come to-night!
<p/>Now I'll tell you something more, wolf, and this ends it. There's them that's as good a match for your uncle Provis as Old Orlick has been for you.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) `ware them, when no man can't find a rag of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dear relation's clothes, nor yet a bone of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body.
<p/>, I know the name!--alive in the same land with them, and that's had such sure information of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was alive in another land, as that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't and shouldn't leave it unbeknown and put them in danger.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) `ware them, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nevvy! There's them that can't and that won't have Magwitch,--yes P'raps it's them that writes fifty hands, and that's not like sneaking you as writes but one. '
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) flared the candle at me again, smoking my face and hair, and for an instant blinding me, and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) powerful back as he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) replaced the light on the table.
<p/>Ware Compeyson, Magwitch, and the gallows! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I had thought a prayer, and had been with Joe and Biddy and Herbert, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) turned towards me again.
<p/>There was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the opposite wall. Within this space, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) now slouched backwards and forwards.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) than ever before, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) did this with his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) hands hanging loose and heavy at his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) sides, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) eyes scowling at me.
<p/>Wild as my inward hurry was, and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me instead of thoughts, I could yet clearly understand that, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had resolved that I was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all human knowledge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) would never have told me what he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had told.
<p/>I had no grain of hope left. Of a sudden, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) stopped, took the cork out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) bottle, and tossed it away.
<p/>Light as it was, I heard it fall like a plummet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) swallowed slowly, tilting up the bottle by little and little, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) looked at me no more.
<p/>Then, with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing horribly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) threw the bottle from him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and stooped; and I saw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) hand a stone-hammer with a long heavy handle.
<p/>The resolution I had made did not desert me, for, without uttering one vain word of appeal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), I shouted out with all my might, and struggled with all my might.
<p/>It was only my head and my legs that I could move, but to that extent I struggled with all the force, until then unknown, that was within me.
<p/>In the same instant I heard responsive shouts, saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the door, heard voices and tumult, and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle of men, as if it were tumbling water, clear the table at a leap, and fly out into the night.
<p/>After a blank, I found that I was lying unbound, on the floor, in the same place, with my head on some one's knee.
<p/>My eyes were fixed on the ladder against the wall, when I came to myself,--had opened on it before my mind saw it,--and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that I was in the place where I had lost it.
<p/>Too indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain who supported me, I was lying looking at the ladder, when there came between me and it a face.
<p/>The last few drops of liquor he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) poured into the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hand, and licked up. The face of Trabb's boy!
<p/>At these words, the face of him (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) who supported me looked over into mine, and I saw my supporter to be-- <div class="bookquote">``Herbert!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>supporter</b></font>)</div>I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)'s all right!'' said Trabb's boy, in a sober voice; <div class="bookquote">``but ain't he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) just pale though! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Trabb boy</b></font>)</div>Great Heaven!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Softly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert. '' Gently, Handel. Don't be too eager.'' '' And our old comrade, Startop!'' I cried, as he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) too bent over me.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Remember what he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) is going to assist us in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``and be calm. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>The allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain in my arm.
<p/>'' The time has not gone by, Herbert, has it? What night is to-night? How long have I been here? ''
<p/>For, I had a strange and strong misgiving that I had been lying there a long time--a day and a night,--two days and nights,--more.
<p/>'' The time has not gone by. It is still Monday night.'' <div class="bookquote">``Thank God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>'' And you have all to-morrow, Tuesday, to rest in,'' said Herbert.
<p/>'' But you can't help groaning, my dear Handel. What hurt have you got? Can you stand?'' '' Yes, yes,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``I can walk.
<p/>I have no hurt but in this throbbing arm. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>They laid it bare, and did what they could. It was violently swollen and inflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched.
<p/>But, they tore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully replaced it in the sling, until we could get to the town and obtain some cooling lotion to put upon it.
<p/>In a little while we had shut the door of the dark and empty sluice-house, and were passing through the quarry on our way back.
<p/>Trabb's boy--Trabb's overgrown young man now--went before us with a lantern, which was the light I had seen come in at the door.
<p/>But, the moon was a good two hours higher than when I had last seen the sky, and the night, though rainy, was much lighter.
<p/>The white vapor of the kiln was passing from us as we went by, and as I had thought a prayer before, I thought a thanksgiving now.
<p/>Entreating Herbert to tell me how he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had come to my rescue,--which at first he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining quiet,--I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our chambers, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), coming home to bring with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) Startop whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had met in the street on his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) way to me, found it, very soon after I was gone.
<p/>Its tone made him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) uneasy, and the more so because of the inconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an hour's consideration, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) set off for the coach-office with Startop, who volunteered his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) company, to make inquiry when the next coach went down.
<p/>Finding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) uneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) way, he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) resolved to follow in a post-chaise.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) and Startop arrived at the Blue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but, finding neither, went on to Miss Havisham's, where they lost me.
<p/>Hereupon they went back to the hotel -LRB-doubtless at about the time when I was hearing the popular local version of my own story-RRB- to refresh themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes.
<p/>Among the loungers under the Boar's archway happened to be Trabb's Boy,--true to his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) had no business,--and
<p/>Thus Trabb's boy became their guide, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) they went out to the sluice-house, though by the town way to the marshes, which I had avoided.
<p/>Now, as they went along, Herbert reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis's safety, and, bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous, left his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and went on by himself, and stole round the house two or three times, endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) could hear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice -LRB-this was while my mind was so busy-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) even at last began to doubt whether I was there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) answered the cries, and rushed in, closely followed by the other two.
<p/>When I told Herbert what had passed within the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was for our immediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as it was, and getting out a warrant.
<p/>But, I had already considered that such a course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might be fatal to Provis.
<p/>Trabb's boy had seen me passing from Miss Havisham's in the direction of my dining-place. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and we relinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time.
<p/>For the present, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make rather light of the matter to Trabb's boy; who, I am convinced, would have been much affected by disappointment, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) had known that his (<font color='blue'><b>Trabb</b></font>) intervention saved me from the limekiln.
<p/>Not that Trabb's boy was of a malignant nature, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had too much spare vivacity, and that it was in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody's expense.
<p/>When we parted, I presented him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with two guineas -LRB-which seemed to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) views-RRB-, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) that I was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) -LRB-which made no impression on him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) at all-RRB-.
<p/>Wednesday being so close upon us, we determined to go back to London that night, three in the post-chaise; the rather, as we should then be clear away before the night's adventure began to be talked of.
<p/>Herbert got a large bottle of stuff for my arm; and by dint of having this stuff dropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bear its pain on the journey.
<p/>It was daylight when we reached the Temple, and I went at once to bed, and lay in bed all day.
<p/>My terror, as I lay there, of falling ill, and being unfitted for to-morrow, was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me of itself.
<p/>It would have done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with the mental wear and tear I had suffered, but for the unnatural strain upon me that to-morrow was.
<p/>No precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from communication with him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) that day; yet this again increased my restlessness.
<p/>I started at every footstep and every sound, believing that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell me so.
<p/>I persuaded myself that I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was taken; that there was something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that the fact had occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it.
<p/>As the days wore on, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell, my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to-morrow morning altogether mastered me.
<p/>So anxiously looked forward to, charged with such consequences, its results so impenetrably hidden, though so near. My burning arm throbbed, and my burning head throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander.
<p/>I counted up to high numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew in prose and verse.
<p/>It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a fatigued mind, I dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say to myself with a start, <div class="bookquote">``Now it has come, and I am turning delirious!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with the notion I had had in the sluice-house, that a long time had elapsed and the opportunity to save him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was gone.
<p/>About midnight I got out of bed and went to Herbert, with the conviction that I had been asleep for four-and-twenty hours, and that Wednesday was past.
<p/>They kept me very quiet all day, and kept my arm constantly dressed, and gave me cooling drinks. It was the last self-exhausting effort of my fretfulness, for after that I slept soundly.
<p/>The winking lights upon the bridges were already pale, the coming sun was like a marsh of fire on the horizon.
<p/>The river, still dark and mysterious, was spanned by bridges that were turning coldly gray, with here and there at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky.
<p/>As I looked along the clustered roofs, with church-towers and spires shooting into the unusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn from the river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters.
<p/>Wednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window. From me too, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.
<p/>I could not dress myself without help; but I made up the fire, which was still burning, and got some coffee ready for them.
<p/>In good time they too started up strong and well, and we admitted the sharp morning air at the windows, and looked at the tide that was still flowing towards us.
<p/>When it turns at nine o'clock,'' said Herbert, cheerfully, <div class="bookquote">``look out for us, and stand ready, you over there at Mill Pond Bank!
<p/>It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade.
<p/>Herbert lay asleep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) bed, and our old fellow-student lay asleep on the sofa. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>'' Chapter LIV We had our pea-coats with us, and I took a bag.
<p/>Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might return, were questions utterly unknown to me; nor did I vex my mind with them, for it was wholly set on Provis's safety.
<p/>I only wondered for the passing moment, as I stopped at the door and looked back, under what altered circumstances I should next see those rooms, if ever.
<p/>We loitered down to the Temple stairs, and stood loitering there, as if we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all.
<p/>Of all my worldly possessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled the bag. Of course, I had taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order.
<p/>After a little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the two or three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we went on board and cast off; Herbert in the bow, I steering.
<p/>The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being with us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned, and row against it until dark.
<p/>We should then be well in those long reaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river is broad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, and where lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which we could choose one for a resting-place.
<p/>It was then about high-water,--half-past eight. Our plan was this. There, we meant to lie by all night. The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would start from London at about nine on Thursday morning.
<p/>We should know at what time to expect them, according to where we were, and would hail the first; so that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, we should have another chance.
<p/>The relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose was so great to me that I felt it difficult to realize the condition in which I had been a few hours before.
<p/>The crisp air, the sunlight, the movement on the river, and the moving river itself,--the road that ran with us, seeming to sympathize with us, animate us, and encourage us
<p/>I felt mortified to be of so little use in the boat; but, there were few better oarsmen than my two friends, and they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day.
<p/>At that time, the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its present extent, and watermen's boats were far more numerous.
<p/>Of barges, sailing colliers, and coasting-traders, there were perhaps, as many as now; but of steam-ships, great and small, not a tithe or a twentieth part so many.
<p/>Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers going here and there that morning, and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide; the navigation of the river between bridges, in an open boat, was a much easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these; and we went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly.
<p/>Old London Bridge was soon passed, and old Billingsgate Market with its oyster-boats and Dutchmen, and the White Tower and Traitor's Gate, and we were in among the tiers of shipping.
<p/>Here were the Leith, Aberdeen, and Glasgow steamers, loading and unloading goods, and looking immensely high out of the water as we passed alongside; here, were colliers by the score and score, with the coal-whippers plunging off stages on deck, as counterweights to measures of coal swinging up, which were then rattled over the side into barges; here, at her (<font color='blue'><b>colliers</b></font>) moorings was to-morrow's steamer for Rotterdam, of which we took good notice; and here to-morrow's for Hamburg, under whose bowsprit we crossed.
<p/>We knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel. on,--freshened me with new hope. And now I, sitting in the stern, could see, with a faster beating heart,
<p/>Mill Pond Bank and Mill Pond stairs. '' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) there?'' said Herbert. '' Not yet. '' '' Right! He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was not to come down till he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) saw us.
<p/>Can you see his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) signal? '' <div class="bookquote">``Not well from here; but I think I see it.--Now I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>)! Pull both.
<p/>Easy, Herbert. Oars! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>We touched the stairs lightly for a single moment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was on board, and we were off again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had a boat-cloak with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), and a black canvas bag; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) looked as like a river-pilot as my heart could have wished.
<p/>'' Dear boy! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arm on my shoulder, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seat. '' Faithful dear boy, well done.
<p/>Again among the tiers of shipping, in and out, avoiding rusty chain-cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys, sinking for the moment floating broken baskets, scattering floating chips of wood and shaving, cleaving floating scum of coal, in and out, under the figure-head of the John of Sunderland making a speech to the winds -LRB-as is done by many Johns-RRB-, and the Betsy of Yarmouth with a firm formality of bosom and her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) knobby eyes starting two inches out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsy</b></font>) head; in and out, hammers going in ship-builders' yards, saws going at timber, clashing engines going at things unknown, pumps going in leaky ships, capstans going, ships going out to sea, and unintelligible sea-creatures roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent lightermen, in and out,--out at last upon the clearer river, where the ships' boys might take their fenders in, no longer fishing in troubled waters with them over the side, and where the festooned sails might fly out to the wind.
<p/>At the stairs where we had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) abroad, and ever since, I had looked warily for any token of our being suspected.
<p/>We certainly had not been, and at that time as certainly we were not either attended or followed by any boat.
<p/>If we had been waited on by any boat, I should have run in to shore, and have obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>) to go on, or to make her (<font color='blue'><b>boys</b></font>) purpose evident.
<p/>Thankye, thankye!'' I had seen none. But we held our own without any appearance of molestation. He (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) boat-cloak on him (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>), and looked, as I have said, a natural part of the scene.
<p/>It was remarkable -LRB-but perhaps the wretched life he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) had led accounted for it-RRB- that he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) was the least anxious of any of us.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) was not indifferent, for he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) hoped to live to see his (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) gentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country; he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) was not disposed to be passive or resigned, as I understood it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) had no notion of meeting danger half way.
<p/>If you knowed, dear boy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said to me, <div class="bookquote">``what it is to sit here alonger my dear boy and have my smoke, arter having been day by day betwixt four walls, you'd envy me.
<p/>When it came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) confronted it, but it must come before he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) troubled himself. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>But you don't know what it is.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think I know the delights of freedom,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. '' Ah,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head gravely. '' But you don't know it equal to me.
<p/>You must have been under lock and key, dear boy, to know it equal to me,--but I ain't a going to be low.
<p/>It occurred to me as inconsistent, that, for any mastering idea, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) should have endangered his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) freedom, and even his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) life.
<p/>But I reflected that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the habit of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) existence to be to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) what it would be to another man.
<p/>I was not far out, since he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, after smoking a little:-- <div class="bookquote">``You see, dear boy, when I was over yonder, t`other side the world, I was always a looking to this side; and it come flat to be there, for all I was a growing rich.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Everybody knowed Magwitch, and Magwitch could come, and Magwitch could go, and nobody's head would be troubled about him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>). They ain't so easy concerning me here
<p/>, dear boy,--wouldn't be, leastwise, if they knowed where I was.'' '' If all goes well,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``you will be perfectly free and safe again within a few hours.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dipped his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand in the water over the boat's gunwale, and said, smiling with that softened air upon him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) which was not new to me:--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) returned, drawing a long breath, <div class="bookquote">``I hope so.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' And think so? '' '' Ay, I s`pose I think so, dear boy.
<p/>We'd be puzzled to be more quiet and easy-going than we are at present. But--it's a flowing so soft and pleasant through the water,
<p/>p`raps, as makes me think it--I was a thinking through my smoke just then, that we can no more see to the bottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this river what I catches hold of.
<p/>Nor yet we can't no more hold their tide than I can hold this. And it's run through my fingers and gone, you see!
<p/>But for your face I should think you were a little despondent,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``Not a bit on it, dear boy!
<p/>It comes of flowing on so quiet, and of that there rippling at the boat's head making a sort of a Sunday tune.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pipe back in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mouth with an undisturbed expression of face, and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of England.
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was as submissive to a word of advice as if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been in constant terror; for, when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer into the boat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was stepping out
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dripping hand. '' Maybe I'm a growing a trifle old besides. '' , I hinted that I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would be safest where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Do you, dear boy?'' and quietly sat down again. The air felt cold upon the river, but it was a bright day, and the sunshine was very cheering.
<p/>The tide ran strong, I took care to lose none of it, and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well.
<p/>By imperceptible degrees, as the tide ran out, we lost more and more of the nearer woods and hills, and dropped lower and lower between the muddy banks, but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend.
<p/>As our charge was wrapped in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cloak, I purposely passed within a boat or two's length of the floating Custom House, and so out to catch the stream, alongside of two emigrant ships, and under the bows of a large transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us.
<p/>And soon the tide began to slacken, and the craft lying at anchor to swing, and presently they had all swung round, and the ships that were taking advantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool began to crowd upon us in a fleet, and we kept under the shore, as much out of the strength of the tide now as we could, standing carefully off from low shallows and mudbanks.
<p/>Our oarsmen were so fresh, by dint of having occasionally let her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) drive with the tide for a minute or two, that a quarter of an hour's rest proved full as much as they wanted.
<p/>It was like my own marsh country, flat and monotonous, and with a dim horizon; while the winding river turned and turned, and the great floating buoys upon it turned and turned, and everything else seemed stranded and still.
<p/>For now the last of the fleet of ships was round the last low point we had headed; and the last green barge, straw-laden, with a brown sail, had followed; and some ballast-lighters, shaped like a child's first rude imitation of a boat, lay low in the mud; and a little squat shoal-lighthouse on open piles stood crippled in the mud on stilts and crutches; and slimy stakes stuck out of the mud, and slimy stones stuck out of the mud, and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud, and an old landing-stage and an old roofless building slipped into the mud, and all about us was stagnation and mud.
<p/>We got ashore among some slippery stones while we ate and drank what we had with us, and looked about. We pushed off again, and made what way we could.
<p/>It was much harder work now, but Herbert and Startop persevered, and rowed and rowed and rowed until the sun went down.
<p/>There was the red sun, on the low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into black; and there was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were the rising grounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life, save here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull.
<p/>As the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full, would not rise early, we held a little council; a short one, for clearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find.
<p/>By that time the river had lifted us a little, so that we could see above the bank. So, they plied their oars once more, and I looked out for anything like a house.
<p/>It was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) galley-fire smoking and flaring, looked like a comfortable home.
<p/>The night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning; and what light we had, seemed to come more from the river than the sky, as the oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars.
<p/>Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or five dull miles. At this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that we were followed.
<p/>As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregular intervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came, one or other of us was sure to start, and look in that direction.
<p/>Here and there, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little creek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them nervously.
<p/>Sometimes, <div class="bookquote">``What was that ripple? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>one of us would say in a low voice. Or another , ``Is that a boat yonder?
<p/>And afterwards we would fall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with what an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.
<p/>At length we descried a light and a roof, and presently afterwards ran alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard by.
<p/>Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the light to be in a window of a public-house.
<p/>It was a dirty place enough, and I dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a good fire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and various liquors to drink.
<p/>No other company was in the house than the landlord, his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) wife, and a grizzled male creature, the <div class="bookquote">``Jack''  (<font color='red'><b>a male creature</b></font>)</div>of the little causeway, who was as slimy and smeary as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had been low-water mark too.
<p/>With this assistant, I went down to the boat again, and we all came ashore, and brought out the oars, and rudder and boat-hook, and all else, and hauled her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) up for the night.
<p/>We made a very good meal by the kitchen fire, and then apportioned the bedrooms: Herbert and Startop were to occupy one; I and our charge the other.
<p/>We found the air as carefully excluded from both, as if air were fatal to life; and there were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have thought the family possessed.
<p/>'' Also, there were two double-bedded rooms,--<div class="bookquote">``such as they were,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the landlord said. But we considered ourselves well off, notwithstanding, for a more solitary place we could not have found.
<p/>While we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, the Jack--who was sitting in a corner, and who had a bloated pair of shoes on, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon, as interesting relics that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had taken a few days ago from the feet of a drowned seaman washed ashore--asked me if we had seen a four-oared galley going up with the tide?
<p/>When I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) must have gone down then, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``took up too,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) left there.
<p/>'' They must ha' thought better on't for some reason or another,'' said the Jack, <div class="bookquote">``and gone down. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div>'' A four-oared galley, did you say?'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``A four,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said the Jack, <div class="bookquote">``and two sitters.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did they come ashore here?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' They put in with a stone two-gallon jar for some beer. I'd ha' been glad to pison the beer myself,'' said the Jack, <div class="bookquote">``or put some rattling physic in it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div>said the Jack. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) spoke in a slushy voice, as if much mud had washed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) throat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) thinks,'' said the landlord, a weakly meditative man with a pale eye, who seemed to rely greatly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) Jack,--<div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) thinks they was, what they wasn't.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``I knows what I thinks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div>observed the Jack. '' You thinks Custum `Us, Jack?'' said the landlord. '' I do,'' said the Jack.
<p/>In the infinite meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) reply and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) boundless confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) views, the Jack took one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) bloated shoes off, looked into it, knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor, and put it on again.
<p/>'' Then you're wrong, Jack.'' <div class="bookquote">``AM I!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) did this with the air of a Jack who was so right that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could afford to do anything.
<p/>'' Why, what do you make out that they done with their buttons then, Jack? '' asked the landlord, vacillating weakly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Done with their buttons? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div>returned the Jack. '' Chucked 'em overboard. Swallered 'em. Sowed 'em, to come up small salad.
<p/>A Custum `Us officer knows what to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) Buttons,'' said the Jack, repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt, <div class="bookquote">``when they comes betwixt him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) own light.
<p/>A four and two sitters don't go hanging and hovering, up with one tide and down with another, and both with and against another, without there being Custum `Us at the bottom of it.
<p/>Saying which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) went out in disdain; and the landlord, having no one to reply upon, found it impracticable to pursue the subject.
<p/>Done with their buttons!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jack</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't be cheeky, Jack,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>remonstrated the landlord, in a melancholy and pathetic way. '' '' This dialogue made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy.
<p/>The dismal wind was muttering round the house, the tide was flapping at the shore, and I had a feeling that we were caged and threatened.
<p/>A four-oared galley hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly circumstance that I could not get rid of.
<p/>When I had induced Provis to go up to bed, I went outside with my two companions -LRB-Startop by this time knew the state of the case-RRB-, and held another council.
<p/>Whether we should remain at the house until near the steamer's time, which would be about one in the afternoon, or whether we should put off early in the morning, was the question we discussed.
<p/>On the whole we deemed it the better course to lie where we were, until within an hour or so of the steamer's time, and then to get out in her (<font color='blue'><b>companions</b></font>) track, and drift easily with the tide.
<p/>Having settled to do this, we returned into the house and went to bed. I lay down with the greater part of my clothes on, and slept well for a few hours.
<p/>When I awoke, the wind had risen, and the sign of the house -LRB-the Ship-RRB- was creaking and banging about, with noises that startled me.
<p/>It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat, and, as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon, I saw two men looking into her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).
<p/>They passed by under the window, looking at nothing else, and they did not go down to the landing-place which I could discern to be empty, but struck across the marsh in the direction of the Nore.
<p/>Rising softly, for my charge lay fast asleep, I looked out of the window. My first impulse was to call up Herbert, and show him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) the two men going away.
<p/>But reflecting, before I got into his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) room, which was at the back of the house and adjoined mine, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) and Startop had had a harder day than I, and were fatigued, I forbore.
<p/>In that light, however, I soon lost them, and, feeling very cold, lay down to think of the matter, and fell asleep again.
<p/>As we walked to and fro, all four together, before breakfast, I deemed it right to recount what I had seen.
<p/>Going back to my window, I could see the two men moving over the marsh. We were up early. Again our charge was the least anxious of the party.
<p/>It was very likely that the men belonged to the Custom House, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said quietly, and that they had no thought of us.
<p/>However, I proposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and I should walk away together to a distant point we could see, and that the boat should take us aboard there, or as near there as might prove feasible, at about noon.
<p/>I tried to persuade myself that it was so,--as, indeed, it might easily be. This being considered a good precaution, soon after breakfast he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and I set forth, without saying anything at the tavern.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pipe as we went along, and sometimes stopped to clap me on the shoulder. One would have supposed that it was I who was in danger, not he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was reassuring me.
<p/>As we approached the point, I begged him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to remain in a sheltered place, while I went on to reconnoitre; for it was towards it that the men had passed in the night.
<p/>There was no boat off the point, nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it, nor were there any signs of the men having embarked there.
<p/>We spoke very little. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) complied, and I went on alone. But, to be sure, the tide was high, and there might have been some footpints under water.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked out from his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) shelter in the distance, and saw that I waved my hat to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to come up, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) rejoined me, and there we waited; sometimes lying on the bank, wrapped in our coats, and sometimes moving about to warm ourselves, until we saw our boat coming round.
<p/>We got aboard easily, and rowed out into the track of the steamer. By that time it wanted but ten minutes of one o'clock, and we began to look out for her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) smoke.
<p/>But, it was half-past one before we saw her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) smoke, and soon afterwards we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer.
<p/>As they were coming on at full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took that opportunity of saying good-bye to Herbert and Startop.
<p/>We had all shaken hands cordially, and neither Herbert's eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I saw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way ahead of us, and row out into the same track.
<p/>A stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer's smoke, by reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was visible, coming head on.
<p/>I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the tide, that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might see us lying by for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and I adjured Provis to sit quite still, wrapped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) cloak.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) answered cheerily, <div class="bookquote">``Trust to me, dear boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley, which was very skilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and fallen alongside.
<p/>Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) kept alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or two when we pulled.
<p/>attentively,--as did all the rowers; the other sitter was wrapped up, much as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper some instruction to the steerer as he (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) looked at us.
<p/>Startop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first, and gave me the word <div class="bookquote">``Hamburg,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>in a low voice, as we sat face to face.
<p/>Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines, and looked at us Not a word was spoken in either boat. She (<font color='blue'><b>sitter</b></font>) was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her (<font color='blue'><b>sitter</b></font>) peddles grew louder and louder.
<p/>I felt as if her (<font color='blue'><b>sitter</b></font>) shadow were absolutely upon us, when the galley hailed us. I answered. '' You have a returned Transport there,'' said the man who held the lines.
<p/>'' That's the man, wrapped in the cloak. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name is Abel Magwitch, otherwise Provis. I apprehend that man, and call upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) to surrender, and you to assist.
<p/>They had pulled one sudden stroke ahead, had got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding on to our gunwale, before we knew what they were doing.
<p/>This caused great confusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and heard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) driving down upon us irresistibly.
<p/>In the same moment, I saw the steersman of the galley lay his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Provis</b></font>) prisoner's shoulder, and saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide, and saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite frantically.
<p/>Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start up, lean across his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of the shrinking sitter in the galley.
<p/>Still in the same moment, I saw that the face disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago.
<p/>Still, in the same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it that I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board the steamer, and a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink from under me.
<p/>It was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand mill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I was taken on board the galley.
<p/>'' At the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) crew, he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) ran the galley abroad of us. Herbert was there, and Startop was there; but our boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone.
<p/>What with the cries aboard the steamer, and the furious blowing off of her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) steam, and her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) driving on, and our driving on, I could not at first distinguish sky from water or shore from shore; but the crew of the galley righted her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) with great speed, and, pulling certain swift strong strokes ahead, lay upon their oars, every man looking silently and eagerly at the water astern.
<p/>No man spoke, but the steersman held up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat straight and true before it.
<p/>Presently a dark object was seen in it, bearing towards us on the tide. As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming, but not swimming freely.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) was taken on board, and instantly manacled at the wrists and ankles. The galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager look-out at the water was resumed.
<p/>By the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) had been hailed and stopped, both steamers were drifting away from us, and we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water.
<p/>The look-out was kept, long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone; but everybody knew that it was hopeless now.
<p/>At length we gave it up, and pulled under the shore towards the tavern we had lately left, where we were received with no little surprise.
<p/>But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently not understanding what had happened, came on at speed. Here I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch,--Provis
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) believed himself to have gone under the keel of the steamer, and to have been struck on the head in rising.
<p/>The injury to his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) chest -LRB-which rendered his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) breathing extremely painful-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) had received against the side of the galley.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) added that he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) did not pretend to say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) might or might not have done to Compeyson, but that, in the moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) cloak to identify him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>), that villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they had both gone overboard together, when the sudden wrenching of him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) -LRB-Magwitch-RRB- out of our boat, and the endeavor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) captor to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) in it, had capsized us.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) told me in a whisper that they had gone down fiercely locked in each other's arms, and that there had been a struggle under water, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) had disengaged himself, struck out, and swum away.
<p/>no longer,--who had received some very severe injury in the Chest, and a deep cut in the head. I never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) thus told me.
<p/>When I asked this officer's permission to change the prisoner's wet clothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the public-house, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) gave it readily: merely observing that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) must take charge of everything his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) prisoner had about him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
<p/>The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going overboard. So the pocket-book which had once been in my hands passed into the officer's.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) further gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but declined to accord that grace to my two friends.
<p/>The Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone down, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was likeliest to come ashore.
<p/>Probably, it took about a dozen drowned men to fit him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) out completely; and that may have been the reason why the different articles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) dress were in various stages of decay.
<p/>We remained at the public-house until the tide turned, and then Magwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) interest in its recovery seemed to me to be much heightened when he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) heard that it had stockings on. Herbert and Startop were to get to London by land, as soon as they could.
<p/>We had a doleful parting, and when I took my place by Magwitch's side, I felt that that was my place henceforth while he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) lived.
<p/>For now, my repugnance to him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) had all melted away; and in the hunted, wounded, shackled creature who held my hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>), I only saw a man who had meant to be my benefactor, and who had felt affectionately, gratefully, and generously, towards me with great constancy through a series of years.
<p/>I only saw in him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) a much better man than I had been to Joe. His (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on, and often he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) could not repress a groan.
<p/>I tried to rest him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) on the arm I could use, in any easy position; but it was dreadful to think that I could not be sorry at heart for his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) being badly hurt, since it was unquestionably best that he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) should die.
<p/>That there were, still living, people enough who were able and willing to identify him (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>), I could not doubt. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) would be leniently treated, I could not hope.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) who had been presented in the worst light at his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) trial, who had since broken prison and had been tried again, who had returned from transportation under a life sentence, and who had occasioned the death of the man who was the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arrest.
<p/>As we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us, and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) how grieved I was to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come home for my sake.
<p/>'' Dear boy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I'm quite content to take my chance. I've seen my boy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) can be a gentleman without me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>No. I had thought about that, while we had been there side by side. No. Apart from any inclinations of my own, I understood Wemmick's hint now.
<p/>I foresaw that, being convicted, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) possessions would be forfeited to the Crown. '' Lookee here, dear boy,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``It's best as a gentleman should not be knowed to belong to me now.
<p/>Sit where I can see you when I am swore to, for the last o' many times, and I don't ask no more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Only come to see me as if you come by chance alonger Wemmick. <div class="bookquote">``I will never stir from your side,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``when I am suffered to be near you.
<p/>I felt his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand tremble as it held mine, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face away as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lay in the bottom of the boat, and I heard that old sound in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) throat,--softened now, like all the rest of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>It was a good thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had touched this point, for it put into my mind what I might not otherwise have thought of until too late,--that
<p/>Please God, I will be as true to you as you have been to me! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) need never know how his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hopes of enriching me had perished.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was taken to the Police Court next day, and would have been immediately committed for trial, but that it was necessary to send down for an old officer of the prison-ship from which he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had once escaped, to speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) identity.
<p/>Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who had meant to depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happened that there was not at that time any prison officer in London who could give the required evidence.
<p/>I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) private house, on my arrival over night, to retain his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) assistance, and Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner's behalf would admit nothing.
<p/>It was the sole resource; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) told me that the case must be over in five minutes when the witness was there, and that no power on earth could prevent its going against us.
<p/>Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for having <div class="bookquote">``let it slip through my fingers,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and said we must memorialize by and by, and try at all events for some of it.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) did not conceal from me that, although there might be many cases in which the forfeiture would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this case to make it one of them.
<p/>Chapter LV I imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) in ignorance of the fate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) wealth. I understood that very well.
<p/>I was not related to the outlaw, or connected with him (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) by any recognizable tie; he (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) had put his (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) hand to no writing or settlement in my favor before his (<font color='blue'><b>outlaw</b></font>) apprehension, and to do so now would be idle.
<p/>I had no claim, and I finally resolved, and ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that my heart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one.
<p/>There appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained some accurate knowledge of Magwitch's affairs.
<p/>When his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) body was found, many miles from the scene of his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) death, and so horribly disfigured that he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) was only recognizable by the contents of his (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) pockets, notes were still legible, folded in a case he (<font color='blue'><b>Magwitch</b></font>) carried.
<p/>Among these were the name of a banking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and the designation of certain lands of considerable value.
<p/>Both these heads of information were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr. Jaggers, of the possessions he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) supposed I should inherit.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) ignorance, poor fellow, at last served him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) never mistrusted but that my inheritance was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers's aid.
<p/>After three days' delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over for the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witness came, and completed the easy case.
<p/>It was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home one evening, a good deal cast down, and said,--
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was committed to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) trial at the next Sessions, which would come on in a month. <div class="bookquote">``My dear Handel, I fear I shall soon have to leave you.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know that I am always with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) to the full extent of the time allowed, and that I should be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) all day long, if I could.

And when I come away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>), you know that my thoughts are with him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>).
<p/>The dreadful condition to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) was brought, was so appalling to both of us, that we could not refer to it in plainer words.
<p/>My dear fellow,'' said Herbert, <div class="bookquote">``let the near prospect of our separation--for, it is very near--be my justification for troubling you about yourself.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>'' Have you thought of your future?'' '' No, for I have been afraid to think of any future.'' ''
<p/>But yours cannot be dismissed; indeed, my dear dear Handel, it must not be dismissed. I wish you would enter on it now, as far as a few friendly words go, with me.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``In this branch house of ours, Handel, we must have a-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>I saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said,
<p/>And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) may expand -LRB-as a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded-RRB- into a partner.
<p/>There was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in which after saying <div class="bookquote">``Now, Handel,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as if it were the grave beginning of a portentous business exordium, he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) had suddenly given up that tone, stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) honest hand, and spoken like a schoolboy.
<p/>Clara and I have talked about it again and again,'' Herbert pursued, ``and the dear little thing begged me only this evening, with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) eyes, to say to you that, if you will live with us when we come together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) will do her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) best to make you happy, and to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) husband's friend that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) friend too.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A clerk. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A clerk. Now, Handel,--in short, my dear boy, will you come to me? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Handel</b></font>)</div>'' We should get on so well, Handel!''
<p/>I thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) heartily, and I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) heartily, but said I could not yet make sure of joining him (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Handel</b></font>) so kindly offered.
<p/>Secondly, there was a vague something lingering in my thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative.
<p/>But if you thought, Herbert, that you could, without doing any injury to your business, leave the question open for a little while--'' <div class="bookquote">``For any while,''  (<font color='red'><b>Herbert/Herbert Pocket</b></font>)</div>cried Herbert.
<p/>Firstly, my mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly. Secondly,--Yes! '' '' Six months, a year!''
<p/>Herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) could now take courage to tell me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) must go away at the end of the week.
<p/>And Clara?'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``The dear little thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned Herbert, ``holds dutifully to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) father as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) lasts; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) won't last long.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not so long as that,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Two or three months at most.

<p/>On the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Herbert,--full of bright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me,--as
<p/>I went into a coffee-house to write a little note to Clara, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had gone off, sending his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) over and over again, and then went to my lonely

<p/>I had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) alone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had come, in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) private and personal capacity, to say a few words of explanation in reference to that failure.
<p/>On the stairs I encountered Wemmick, who was coming down, after an unsuccessful application of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) knuckles to my door. ''
<p/>The late Compeyson,'' said Wemmick, ``had by little and little got at the bottom of half of the regular business now transacted; and it was from the talk of some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) people in trouble -LRB-some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) people being always in trouble-RRB- that I heard what I did.
<p/>I kept my ears open, seeming to have them shut, until I heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was absent, and I thought that would be the best time for making the attempt.
<p/>I can only suppose now, that it was a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) policy, as a very clever man, habitually to deceive his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) own instruments.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you most earnestly for all your interest and friendship.
<p/>You don't blame me, I hope, Mr. Pip? I am sure I tried to serve you, with all my heart.''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>It's a bad job,'' said Wemmick, scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) head, ``and I assure you I haven't been so cut up for a long time.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, thank you very much. What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portable property. Dear me!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What I think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.
<p/>Of course, there can be no objection to your being sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>), and I'd put down a five-pound note myself to get him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) out of it.
<p/>The late Compeyson having been beforehand with him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) in intelligence of his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) return, and being so determined to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) to book, I do not think he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) could have been saved.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, to be sure,'' said Wemmick. '' But what I look at is this. Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been saved.
<p/>That's the difference between the property and the owner, don't you see? '' I invited Wemmick to come upstairs, and refresh himself with a glass of grog before walking to Walworth.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) was drinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) moderate allowance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) said, with nothing to lead up to it, and after having appeared rather fidgety,--
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) accepted the invitation. '' What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr. Pip?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>'' These twelve years, more likely,'' said Wemmick. '' Yes. I'm going to take a holiday. More than that; I'm going to take a walk.
<p/>More than that; I'm going to ask you to take a walk with me. '' I was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just then, when Wemmick anticipated me.
<p/>'' I know your engagements,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and I know you are out of sorts, Mr. Pip. But if you could oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.
<p/>It ain't a long walk, and it's an early one. Say it might occupy you -LRB-including breakfast on the walk-RRB- from eight to twelve.
<p/>Couldn't you stretch a point and manage it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little to do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>).
<p/>I said I could manage it,--would manage it,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) was so very much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too.
<p/>At his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) particular request, I appointed to call for him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) at the Castle at half past eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time.
<p/>Punctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday morning, and was received by Wemmick himself, who struck me as looking tighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on.
<p/>The Aged must have been stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) bedroom, I observed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) bed was empty.
<p/>When we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits, and were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I was considerably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put it over his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>Within, there were two glasses of rum and milk prepared, and two biscuits. '' Why, we are not going fishing!'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``No,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>returned Wemmick, <div class="bookquote">``but I like to walk with one.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>I thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off. We went towards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick said suddenly,--
<p/>There was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was rather surprised, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) said, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) were animated by a brilliant idea,--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloa! Here's a church! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let's go in! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>We went in, Wemmick leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) fishing-rod in the porch, and looked all round.
<p/>In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) coat-pockets, and getting something out of paper there. <div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>). ''
<p/>As the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widened to its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions.
<p/>Here's a couple of pair of gloves! Let's put 'em on!'' They were strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side door, escorting a lady.
<p/>That discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) was now engaged in substituting for her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) green kid gloves a pair of white.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Halloa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick. '' Here's Miss Skiffins! Let's have a wedding. '' The Aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the altar of Hymen.
<p/>The old gentleman, however, experienced so much difficulty in getting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary to put him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) back against a pillar, and then to get behind the pillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old gentleman round the waist, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might present an equal and safe resistance.
<p/>By dint of this ingenious scheme, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gloves were got on to perfection. The clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order at those fatal rails.
<p/>True to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) notion of seeming to do it all without preparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) took something out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) waistcoat-pocket before the service began, ``Halloa!
<p/>I acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom; while a little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby's, made a feint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins.
<p/>The responsibility of giving the lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the clergyman's being unintentionally scandalized, and it happened thus.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the old gentleman, not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments.
<p/>'' The old gentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness, the bridegroom cried out in his (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) accustomed voice,
<p/>Here's a ring! '' Upon which, the clergyman said again, ``WHO giveth this woman to be married to this man? <div class="bookquote">``Now Aged P. you know; who giveth?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To which the Aged replied with great briskness, before saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave, <div class="bookquote">``All right, John, all right, my boy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon it, that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely married that day.
<p/>It was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church Wemmick took the cover off the font, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) white gloves in it, and put the cover on again.
<p/>Now, Mr. Pip,'' said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came out, ``let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a wedding-party!
<p/>Breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so away upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelle board in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after the solemnity.
<p/>It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer unwound Wemmick's arm when it adapted itself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) figure, but sat in a high-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case, and submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done.
<p/>We had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on table, Wemmick said, <div class="bookquote">``Provided by contract, you know; don't be afraid of it!
<p/>Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future, put her (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) white gloves in her (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) pocket and assumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) green. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>'' ''
<p/>I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to the Castle, saluted the bride at parting, and made myself as agreeable as I could.
<p/>Wemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>), and wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) joy. <div class="bookquote">``Thankee! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Wemmick/Mr. Wemmick</b></font>)</div>said Wemmick, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wemmick</b></font>) hands.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>)'s such a manager of fowls, you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and judge for yourself. I say, Mr. Pip!
<p/>'' calling me back, and speaking low. '' This is altogether a Walworth sentiment, please.'' <div class="bookquote">``I understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. Wemmick nodded.
<p/>'' After what you let out the other day, Mr. Jaggers may as well not know of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) might think my brain was softening, or something of the kind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) committal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had broken two ribs, they had wounded one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) lungs, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) breathed with great pain and difficulty, which increased daily.
<p/>It was a consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) hurt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) spoke very little.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was ever ready to listen to me; and it became the first duty of my life to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), and read to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), what I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) ought to hear.
<p/>Being far too ill to remain in the common prison, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was removed, after the first day or so, into the infirmary.
<p/>And but for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) illness he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) would have been put in irons, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was regarded as a determined prison-breaker, and I know not what else.
<p/>Although I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) every day, it was for only a short time; hence, the regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) face any slight changes that occurred in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) physical state.
<p/>I do not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) wasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the day when the prison door closed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>).
<p/>'' Chapter LVI This gave me opportunities of being with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) that I could not otherwise have had. The kind of submission or resignation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) showed was that of a man who was tired out.
<p/>I sometimes derived an impression, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) manner or from a whispered word or two which escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) pondered over the question whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) might have been a better man under better circumstances.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) never justified himself by a hint tending that way, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape.
<p/>It happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) desperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>).
<p/>A smile crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) face then, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) eyes on me with a trustful look, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) were confident that I had seen some small redeeming touch in him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>), even so long ago as when I was a little child.
<p/>When the Sessions came round, Mr. Jaggers caused an application to be made for the postponement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) trial until the following Sessions.
<p/>As to all the rest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was humble and contrite, and I never knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) complain. It was obviously made with the assurance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) could not live so long, and was refused.
<p/>No objection was made to my getting close to the dock, on the outside of it, and holding the hand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) stretched forth to me.
<p/>The trial came on at once, and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was put to the bar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) was seated in a chair. The trial was very short and very clear.
<p/>Such things as could be said for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) were said,--how he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had taken to industrious habits, and had thriven lawfully and reputably.
<p/>But nothing could unsay the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jaggers</b></font>) had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury. It was impossible to try him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) for that, and do otherwise than find him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) guilty.
<p/>At that time, it was the custom -LRB-as I learnt from my terrible experience of that Sessions-RRB- to devote a concluding day to the passing of Sentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of Death.
<p/>But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me, I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that I saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that sentence together.
<p/>The whole scene starts out again in the vivid colors of the moment, down to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glittering in the rays of April sun.
<p/>Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside it at the corner with his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men and women; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and weeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about.
<p/>Foremost among the two-and-thirty was he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>); seated, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) might get breath enough to keep life in him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>). There had been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had been stilled, and a hush had succeeded.
<p/>The sheriffs with their great chains and nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great gallery full of people,--a large theatrical
<p/>Among the wretched creatures before him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) must single out for special address was one who almost from his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) infancy had been an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments and punishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years; and who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life.
<p/>That miserable man would seem for a time to have become convinced of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) errors, when far removed from the scenes of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old offences, and to have lived a peaceable and honest life.
<p/>But in a fatal moment, yielding to those propensities and passions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a scourge to society, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had quitted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) haven of rest and repentance, and had come back to the country where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was proscribed.
<p/>Being here presently denounced, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had for a time succeeded in evading the officers of Justice, but being at length seized while in the act of flight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Justice</b></font>) had resisted them, and had--he (<font color='blue'><b>Justice</b></font>) best knew whether by express design, or in the blindness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Justice</b></font>) hardihood--caused the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Justice</b></font>) denouncer, to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Justice</b></font>) whole career was known.
<p/>The appointed punishment for his (<font color='blue'><b>Justice</b></font>) return to the land that had cast him (<font color='blue'><b>Justice</b></font>) out, being Death, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Justice</b></font>) case being this aggravated case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Justice</b></font>) must prepare himself to Die.
<p/>The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the glittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of light between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together, and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on, with absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all things, and cannot err.
<p/>Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face in this way of light, the prisoner said, <div class="bookquote">``My Lord, I have received my sentence of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prisoner</b></font>)</div>and sat down again.
<p/>audience,--looked on, as the two-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judge addressed them. There was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) had to say to the rest.
<p/>Then they were all formally doomed, and some of them were supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three shook hands, and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from the sweet herbs lying about.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) went last of all, because of having to be helped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) chair, and to go very slowly; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) held my hand while all the others were removed, and while the audience got up -LRB-putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere-RRB-, and pointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) and me.
<p/>I earnestly hoped and prayed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) might die before the Recorder's Report was made; but, in the dread of his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) lingering on, I began that night to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State, setting forth my knowledge of him (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>), and how it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) had come back for my sake.
<p/>I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could; and when I had finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other petitions to such men in authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and drew up one to the Crown itself.
<p/>For several days and nights after he (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) was sentenced I took no rest except when I fell asleep in my chair, but was wholly absorbed in these appeals.
<p/>And after I had sent them in, I could not keep away from the places where they were, but felt as if they were more hopeful and less desperate when I was near them.
<p/>In this unreasonable restlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening, wandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions.
<p/>To the present hour, the weary western streets of London on a cold, dusty spring night, with their ranges of stern, shut-up mansions, and their long rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this association.
<p/>Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an intention of carrying poison to him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), I asked to be searched before I sat down at his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) bedside, and told the officer who was always there, that I was willing to do anything that would assure him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) of the singleness of my designs.
<p/>The daily visits I could make him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) were shortened now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was more strictly kept. Nobody was hard with him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) or with me.
<p/>The officer always gave me the assurance that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) was worse, and some other sick prisoners in the room, and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick nurses, -LRB-malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God be thanked!-RRB-
<p/>As the days went on, I noticed more and more that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would lie placidly looking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face until some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would subside again.
<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was almost or quite unable to speak, then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would answer me with slight pressures on my hand, and I grew to understand his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) meaning very well.
<p/>The number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change in him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) than I had seen yet.
<p/>There was duty to be done, and it was done, but not harshly. always joined in the same report. His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes were turned towards the door, and lighted up as I entered.
<p/>'' Dear boy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, as I sat down by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bed: <div class="bookquote">``I thought you was late. But I knowed you couldn't be that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is just the time,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``I waited for it at the gate. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You always waits at the gate; don't you, dear boy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes. Not to lose a moment of the time.'' <div class="bookquote">``Thank`ee dear boy, thank`ee. God bless you! You've never deserted me, dear boy.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had once meant to desert him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). ''
<p/>And what's the best of all,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you've been more comfortable alonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun shone.
<p/>Do what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would, and love me though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did, the light left his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face ever and again, and a film came over the placid look at the white ceiling.
<p/>That's best of all. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) back, breathing with great difficulty. '' Are you in much pain to-day?''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) smiled, and I understood his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) touch to mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) breast.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't complain of none, dear boy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You never do complain. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had spoken his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) last words. I laid it there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) smiled again, and put both his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands upon it.
<p/>The allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking round, I found the governor of the prison standing near me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) whispered, <div class="bookquote">``You needn't go yet.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) gratefully, and asked, <div class="bookquote">``Might I speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) can hear me?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away.
<p/>The change, though it was made without noise, drew back the film from the placid look at the white ceiling, and he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) looked most affectionately at me.
<p/>'' Dear Magwitch, I must tell you now, at last. You understand what I say? '' A gentle pressure on my hand.
<p/>'' You had a child once, whom you loved and lost. '' A stronger pressure on my hand. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) lived, and found powerful friends.
<p/>With a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for my yielding to it and assisting it, he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) raised my hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) lips.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) is living now. She (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) is a lady and very beautiful. And I love her (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>)!'' Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) gently let it sink upon his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) breast again, with his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) own hands lying on it.
<p/>Mindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two men who went up into the Temple to pray, and I knew there were no better words that I could say beside his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) bed, than <div class="bookquote">``O Lord, be merciful to him (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) a sinner!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away, and his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) head dropped quietly on his (<font color='blue'><b>governor</b></font>) breast. Chapter LVII
<p/>Now that I was left wholly to myself, I gave notice of my intention to quit the chambers in the Temple as soon as my tenancy could legally determine, and in the meanwhile to underlet them.
<p/>At once I put bills up in the windows; for, I was in debt, and had scarcely any money, and began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs.
<p/>I ought rather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth beyond the fact that I was falling very ill.
<p/>The late stress upon me had enabled me to put off illness, but not to put it away; I knew that it was coming on me now, and I knew very little else, and was even careless as to that.
<p/>For a day or two, I lay on the sofa, or on the floor,--anywhere, according as I happened to sink down,--with a heavy head and aching limbs, and no purpose, and no power.
<p/>Then there came, one night which appeared of great duration, and which teemed with anxiety and horror; and when in the morning I tried to sit up in my bed and think of it, I found I could not do so.
<p/>Whether I really had been down in Garden Court in the dead of the night, groping about for the boat that I supposed to be there; whether I had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror, not knowing how I had got out of bed; whether I had found myself lighting the lamp, possessed by the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was coming up the stairs, and that the lights were blown out; whether I had been inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking, laughing, and groaning of some one, and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making; whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of the room, and a voice had called out, over and over again, that Miss Havisham was consuming within it,--these were things that I tried to settle with myself and get into some order, as I lay that morning on my bed.
<p/>But the vapor of a limekiln would come between me and them, disordering them all, and it was through the vapor at last that I saw two men looking at me.
<p/>Well, sir,'' returned one of them, bending down and touching me on the shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``this is a matter that you'll soon arrange, I dare say, but you're arrested.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>What do you want? '' I asked, starting; <div class="bookquote">``I don't know you.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``What is the debt?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hundred and twenty-three pound, fifteen, six.
<p/>Jeweller's account, I think. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What is to be done?'' <div class="bookquote">``You had better come to my house,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man.
<p/>'' I keep a very nice house. '' I made some attempt to get up and dress myself. When I next attended to them, they were standing a little off from the bed, looking at me.
<p/>I still lay there. '' You see my state,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``I would come with you if I could; but indeed I am quite unable.
<p/>Perhaps they replied, or argued the point, or tried to encourage me to believe that I was better than I thought.
<p/>If you take me from here, I think I shall die by the way. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>Forasmuch as they hang in my memory by only this one slender thread
<p/>That I had a fever and was avoided, that I suffered greatly, that I often lost my reason, that the time seemed interminable, that I confounded impossible existences with my own identity; that I was a brick in the house-wall, and yet entreating to be released from the giddy place where the builders had set me; that I was a steel beam of a vast engine, clashing and whirling over a gulf, and yet that I implored in my own person to have the engine stopped, and my part in it hammered off; that I passed through these phases of disease, I know of my own remembrance, and did in some sort know at the time.
<p/>That I sometimes struggled with real people, in the belief that they were murderers, and that I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good, and would then sink exhausted in their arms, and suffer them to lay me down, I also knew at the time.
<p/>, I don't know what they did, except that they forbore to remove me. But, above all, I knew that there was a constant tendency in all these
<p/>people,--who, when I was very ill, would present all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face, and would be much dilated in size,--above all, I say, I knew that there was an extraordinary tendency in all these people, sooner or later, to settle down into the likeness of Joe.
<p/>After I had turned the worst point of my illness, I began to notice that while all its other features changed, this one consistent feature did not change.
<p/>Whoever came about me, still settled down into Joe. I opened my eyes in the night, and I saw, in the great chair at the bedside, Joe.
<p/>I opened my eyes in the day, and, sitting on the window-seat, smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pipe in the shaded open window, still I saw Joe.
<p/>I sank back on my pillow after drinking, and the face that looked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of Joe.
<p/>I asked for cooling drink, and the dear hand that gave it me was Joe's. At last, one day, I took courage, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Is it Joe?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And the dear old home-voice answered, <div class="bookquote">``Which it air, old chap.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O Joe, you break my heart! Look angry at me, Joe.
<p/>For Joe had actually laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) head down on the pillow at my side, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) arm round my neck, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) joy that I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>).
<p/>Strike me, Joe. Tell me of my ingratitude. Don't be so good to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Pip/Mr. Pip</b></font>)</div>'' Which dear old Pip, old chap,'' said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``you and me was ever friends.
<p/>And when you're well enough to go out for a ride--what larks!''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>After which, Joe withdrew to the window, and stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) back towards me, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>And as my extreme weakness prevented me from getting up and going to him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>), I lay there, penitently whispering, <div class="bookquote">``O God bless him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!
<p/>Joe's eyes were red when I next found him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) beside me; but I was holding his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand, and we both felt happy.
<p/>O God bless this gentle Christian man!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' How long, dear Joe? '' '' Which you meantersay, Pip, how long have your illness lasted, dear old chap?
<p/>'' '' Yes, Joe.'' '' It's the end of May, Pip. To-morrow is the first of June.'' '' And have you been here all that time, dear Joe?''
<p/>For, as I says to Biddy when the news of your being ill were brought by letter, which it were brought by the post, and being formerly single
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) is now married though underpaid for a deal of walking and shoe-leather, but wealth were not a object on his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) part, and marriage were the great wish of his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) hart--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pretty nigh, old chap. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is so delightful to hear you, Joe! But I interrupt you in what you said to Biddy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Which it were,'' said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``that how you might be amongst strangers, and that how you and me having been ever friends, a wisit at such a moment might not prove unacceptabobble.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>And Biddy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) word were, `Go to him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>), without loss of time.' That,'' said Joe, summing up with his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) judicial air, <div class="bookquote">``were the word of Biddy. '
<p/>In short, I shouldn't greatly deceive you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe added, after a little grave reflection, <div class="bookquote">``if I represented to you that the word of that young woman were, `without a minute's loss of time.'
<p/>There Joe cut himself short, and informed me that I was to be talked to in great moderation, and that I was to take a little nourishment at stated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not, and that I was to submit myself to all his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) orders.
<p/>So I kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hand, and lay quiet, while he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love in it.
<p/>As I lay in bed looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), it made me, in my weak state, cry again with pleasure to see the pride with which he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) set about his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) letter.
<p/>My bedstead, divested of its curtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sitting-room, as the airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and the room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day.
<p/>At my own writing-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles, Joe now sat down to his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) great work, first choosing a pen from the pen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sleeves as if he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer.
<p/>It was necessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) left elbow, and to get his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) right leg well out behind him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), before he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could begin; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) did begin he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) made every downstroke so slowly that it might have been six feet long, while at every upstroke I could hear his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) pen spluttering extensively.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had a curious idea that the inkstand was on the side of him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) where it was not, and constantly dipped his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) pen into space, and seemed quite satisfied with the result.
<p/>Occasionally, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was tripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) got on very well indeed; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had signed his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) name, and had removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) head with his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) two forefingers, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) got up and hovered about the table, trying the effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) performance from various points of view, as it lay there, with unbounded satisfaction.
<p/>Not to make Joe uneasy by talking too much, even if I had been able to talk much, I deferred asking him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) about Miss Havisham until next day.
<p/>Go to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>),' Biddy say, `without loss of time.' ''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Evidently Biddy had taught Joe to write. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) head when I then asked him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had recovered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why you see, old chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, in a tone of remonstrance, and by way of getting at it by degrees, <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't go so far as to say that, for that's a deal to say; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) ain't--''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Living, Joe?''

<p/>Well, old chap,'' said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``it do appear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had settled the most of it, which I meantersay tied it up, on Miss Estella.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>'' Dear Joe, have you heard what becomes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) property?'' '' But she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had wrote out a little coddleshell in her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) own hand
<p/>a day or two afore the accident, leaving a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew Pocket. And why, do you suppose, above all things,
<p/>I am told by Biddy, that air the writing,'' said Joe, repeating the legal turn as if it did him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) infinite good, ''`account of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pocket</b></font>) the said Matthew.'
<p/>Pip, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) left that cool four thousand unto him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>)? ' Because of Pip's account of him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>), the said Matthew.' And a cool four thousand, Pip!''
<p/>I never discovered from whom Joe derived the conventional temperature of the four thousand pounds; but it appeared to make the sum of money more to him (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had a manifest relish in insisting on its being cool.
<p/>This account gave me great joy, as it perfected the only good thing I had done. I asked Joe whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Matthew</b></font>) had heard if any of the other relations had any legacies? ''
<p/>Miss Sarah,'' said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) have twenty-five pound perannium fur to buy pills, on account of being bilious. Miss Georgiana, she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) have twenty pound down.

<p/>Joe nodded. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Camilla/Mrs. Camilla</b></font>)</div>'' The accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me, to give me great confidence in Joe's information.
<p/>And now,'' said Joe, ``you ain't that strong yet, old chap, that you can take in more nor one additional shovelful to-day.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not, I grant you, but what his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) manners is given to blusterous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, apologetically; <div class="bookquote">``still, a Englishman's ouse is his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) Castle, and castles must not be busted `cept when done in war time.

And wotsume'er the failings on his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) part, he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) were a corn and seedsman in his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) hart.''
<p/>That's it, Pip,'' said Joe; ``and they took his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) till, and they took his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) cash-box, and they drinked his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) wine, and they partook of his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) wittles, and they slapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) face, and they pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) nose, and they tied him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) bedpust, and they giv' him (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) a dozen, and they stuffed his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) mouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) crying out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it Pumblechook's house that has been broken into, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Orlick</b></font>) knowed Orlick, and Orlick's in the county jail.
<p/>I was slow to gain strength, but I did slowly and surely become less weak, and Joe stayed with me, and I fancied I was little Pip again.
<p/>For the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need, that I was like a child in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) hands.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) would sit and talk to me in the old confidence, and with the old simplicity, and in the old unassertive protecting way, so that I would half believe that all my life since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles of the fever that was gone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) did everything for me except the household work, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) had engaged a very decent woman, after paying off the laundress on his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) first arrival.
<p/>Which I do assure you, Pip,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) would often say, in explanation of that liberty; <div class="bookquote">``I found her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a tapping the spare bed, like a cask of beer, and drawing off the feathers in a bucket, for sale.
<p/>Which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have tapped yourn next, and draw'd it off with you a laying on it, and was then a carrying away the coals gradiwally in the soup-tureen and wegetable-dishes, and the wine and spirits in your Wellington boots.
<p/>We looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride, as we had once looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship.
<p/>And when the day came, and an open carriage was got into the Lane, Joe wrapped me up, took me in his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) arms, carried me down to it, and put me in, as if I were still the small helpless creature to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had so abundantly given of the wealth of his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) great nature.
<p/>And Joe got in beside me, and we drove away together into the country, where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass, and sweet summer scents filled all the air.
<p/>The day happened to be Sunday, and when I looked on the loveliness around me, and thought how it had grown and changed, and how the little wild-flowers had been forming, and the voices of the birds had been strengthening, by day and by night, under the sun and under the stars,
<p/>while poor I lay burning and tossing on my bed, the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed there came like a check upon my peace.
<p/>But when I heard the Sunday bells, and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty, I felt that I was not nearly thankful
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>By these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation. '' '' enough,--that I was too weak yet to be even that,--and
<p/>I laid my head on Joe's shoulder, as I had laid it long ago when he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was too much for my young senses.
<p/>More composure came to me after a while, and we talked as we used to talk, lying on the grass at the old Battery.
<p/>Exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) had been in my eyes then, he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) was in my eyes still; just as simply faithful, and as simply right.
<p/>There was no change whatever in Joe. When we got back again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) lifted me out, and carried me-- so easily!--across
<p/>the court and up the stairs , I thought of that eventful Christmas Day when he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) had carried me over the marshes.
<p/>We had not yet made any allusion to my change of fortune, nor did I know how much of my late history he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) was acquainted with.
<p/>I was so doubtful of myself now, and put so much trust in him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>), that I could not satisfy myself whether I ought to refer to it when he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) did not.
<p/>Have you heard, Joe,'' I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) that evening, upon further consideration, as he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) smoked his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) pipe at the window, <div class="bookquote">``who my patron was?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' I heerd,'' returned Joe, <div class="bookquote">``as it were not Miss Havisham, old chap.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did you hear who it was, Joe?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well! I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv' you the bank-notes at the Jolly Bargemen, Pip.
<p/>'' '' So it was.'' <div class="bookquote">``Astonishing! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, in the placidest way. '' Did you hear that he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was dead, Joe?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, after meditating a long time, and looking rather evasively at the window-seat, <div class="bookquote">``as I did hear tell that how he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) were something or another in a general way in that direction.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>I presently asked, with increasing diffidence. '' Which? Him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) as sent the bank-notes, Pip?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Did you hear anything of his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) circumstances, Joe?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not partickler, Pip.''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>'' If you would like to hear, Joe--'' I was beginning, when Joe got up and came to my sofa.
<p/>'' Lookee here, old chap,'' said Joe, bending over me. '' Ever the best of friends; ain't us, Pip? '' I was ashamed to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>).
<p/>'' Wery good, then,'' said Joe, as if I had answered; <div class="bookquote">``that's all right; that's agreed upon. Then why go into subjects, old chap, which as betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary?
<p/>There's subjects enough as betwixt two sech, without onnecessary ones. Lord! To think of your poor sister and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) Rampages! And don't you remember Tickler?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I done what I could to keep you and Tickler in sunders, but my power were not always fully equal to my inclinations.
<p/>For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you, it were not so much,'' said Joe, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) favorite argumentative way, ``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) dropped into me too, if I put myself in opposition to her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) dropped into you always heavier for it.
<p/>It ain't a grab at a man's whisker, not yet a shake or two of a man -LRB-to which your sister was quite welcome-RRB-, that `ud put a man off from getting a little child out of punishment.
<p/>But when that little child is dropped into heavier for that grab of whisker or shaking, then that man naterally up and says to himself, `Where is the good as you are a doing?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do indeed, Joe.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Lookee here, old chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. '' I noticed that. I grant you I see the `arm,' says the man, `but I don't see the good.
<p/>I call upon you, sir, therefore, to pint out the good.''' '' The man says? '' I observed, as Joe waited for me to speak.
<p/>'' The man says,'' Joe assented. '' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right, that man?'' '' Dear Joe, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is always right.'' '' Well, old chap,'' said Joe, <div class="bookquote">``then abide by your words.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s always right -LRB-which in general he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s more likely wrong-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s right when he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) says this: Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself, when you was a little child, you kep it mostly because you know'd as J. Gargery's power to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equal to his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) inclinations.
<p/>Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt two sech, and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects. Biddy giv' herself a deal o' trouble with me afore
<p/>I left -LRB-for I am almost awful dull-RRB-, as I should view it in this light, and, viewing it in this light, as I should so put it.
<p/>Both of which,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, quite charmed with his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) logical arrangement, ``being done, now this to you a true friend, say.
<p/>You mustn't go a overdoing on it, but you must have your supper and your wine and water, and you must be put betwixt the sheets.
<p/>The delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact and kindness with which Biddy--who with her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) woman's wit had found me out so soon--had prepared him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) for it, made a deep impression on my mind.
<p/>But whether Joe knew how poor I was, and how my great expectations had all dissolved, like our own marsh mists before the sun, I could not understand.
<p/>Another thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to develop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension of, was this: As I became stronger and better, Joe became a little less easy with me.
<p/>In my weakness and entire dependence on him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), the dear fellow had fallen into the old tone, and called me by the old names, the dear <div class="bookquote">``old Pip, old chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>that now were music in my ears.
<p/>But, imperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Joe's hold upon them began to slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began to understand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it was all mine.
<p/>Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think that in prosperity I should grow cold to him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) and cast him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) off?
<p/>Namely. '' I too had fallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) let me. Ah! Had I given Joe's innocent heart
<p/>no cause to feel instinctively that as I got stronger, his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) hold upon me would be weaker, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) had better loosen it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away?
<p/>It was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the Temple Gardens leaning on Joe's arm, that I saw this change in him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) very plainly.
<p/>We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight, looking at the river, and I chanced to say as we got up,--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``See, Joe! I can walk quite strongly. Now, you shall see me walk back by myself. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Which do not overdo it, Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but I shall be happy fur to see you able, sir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>The last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate!
<p/>I walked no further than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to be weaker than I was, and asked Joe for his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) arm.
<p/>I, for my part, was thoughtful too; for, how best to check this growing change in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts.
<p/>That I was ashamed to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) exactly how I was placed, and what I had come down to, I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was not quite an unworthy one.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) would want to help me out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) little savings, I knew, and I knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) ought not to help me, and that I must not suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) to do it.
<p/>Joe gave it me, but was thoughtful. It was a thoughtful evening with both of us. But, before we went to bed, I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow,--to-morrow being Sunday,--and
<p/>On Monday morning I would speak to Joe about this change, I would lay aside this last vestige of reserve, I would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) what I had in my thoughts -LRB-that Secondly, not yet arrived at-RRB-, and why I had not decided to go out to Herbert, and then the change would be conquered for ever.
<p/>would begin my new course with the new week. As I cleared, Joe cleared, and it seemed as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) had sympathetically arrived at a resolution too.
<p/>We had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, and then walked in the fields.
<p/>'' I feel thankful that I have been ill, Joe,'' I said. '' Dear old Pip, old chap, you're a`most come round, sir.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It has been a memorable time for me, Joe.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Likeways for myself, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>Joe returned. '' We have had a time together, Joe, that I can never forget.
<p/>There were days once, I know, that I did for a while forget; but I never shall forget these.'' <div class="bookquote">``Pip,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled, <div class="bookquote">``there has been larks.
<p/>At night, when I had gone to bed, Joe came into my room, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had done all through my recovery.
<p/>And, dear sir, what have been betwixt us--have been. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) asked me if I felt sure that I was as well as in the morning?
<p/>Joe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) great good hand, and said, in what I thought a husky voice, <div class="bookquote">``Good night!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>When I got up in the morning, refreshed and stronger yet, I was full of my resolution to tell Joe all, without delay.
<p/>'' Yes, dear Joe, quite. '' '' And are always a getting stronger, old chap?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear Joe, steadily. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) before breakfast.
<p/>I would dress at once and go to his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) room and surprise him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>); for, it was the first day I had been up early.
<p/>I went to his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was not there. Not only was he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) not there, but his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) box was gone.
<p/>I hurried then to the breakfast-table, and on it found a letter. These were its brief contents:-- <div class="bookquote">``Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur
<p/>you are well again dear Pip and will do better without JO. ''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>P.S. Ever the best of friends. '' Enclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which I had been arrested.
<p/>Down to that moment, I had vainly supposed that my creditor had withdrawn, or suspended proceedings until I should be quite recovered.
<p/>I had never dreamed of Joe's having paid the money; but Joe had paid it, and the receipt was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) name.
<p/>What remained for me now, but to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>) to the dear old forge, and there to have out my disclosure to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), and my penitent remonstrance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pip</b></font>), and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved Secondly, which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts, and had formed into a settled purpose?
<p/>The purpose was, that I would go to Biddy, that I would show her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) how humbled and repentant I came back, that I would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) how I had lost all I once hoped for, that I would remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) of our old confidences in my first unhappy time.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Biddy, I think you once liked me very well, when my errant heart, even while it strayed away from you, was quieter and better with you than it ever has been since.
<p/>If you can like me only half as well once more, if you can take me with all my faults and disappointments on my head, if you can receive me like a forgiven child -LRB-and indeed I am as sorry, Biddy, and have as much need of a hushing voice and a soothing hand-RRB-, I hope I am a little worthier of you that I was,--not much, but a little.
<p/>And, Biddy, it shall rest with you to say whether I shall work at the forge with Joe, or whether I shall try for any different occupation down in this country, or whether we shall go away to a distant place where an opportunity awaits me which I set aside, when it was offered, until I knew your answer.
<p/>And now, dear Biddy, if you can tell me that you will go through the world with me, you will surely make it a better world for me, and me a better man for it, and I will try hard to make it a better world for you.
<p/>Then I would say to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Such was my purpose. After three days more of recovery, I went down to the old place to put it in execution.
<p/>The tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down to my native place and its neighborhood before I got there.
<p/>I found the Blue Boar in possession of the intelligence, and I found that it made a great change in the Boar's demeanour.
<p/>Whereas the Boar had cultivated my good opinion with warm assiduity when I was coming into property, the Boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that I was going out of property.
<p/>And how I sped in it is all I have left to tell. Chapter LVIII It was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I had so often made so easily.
<p/>The Boar could not put me into my usual bedroom, which was engaged -LRB-probably by some one who had expectations-RRB-, and could only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and post-chaises up the yard.
<p/>But I had as sound a sleep in that lodging as in the most superior accommodation the Boar could have given me, and the quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom.
<p/>There were printed bills on the gate and on bits of carpet hanging out of the windows, announcing a sale by auction of the Household Furniture and Effects, next week.
<p/>Early in the morning, while my breakfast was getting ready, I strolled round by Satis House. The House itself was to be sold as old building materials, and pulled down.
<p/>LOT 1 was marked in whitewashed knock-knee letters on the brew house; LOT 2 on that part of the main building which had been so long shut up.
<p/>Other lots were marked off on other parts of the structure, and the ivy had been torn down to make room for the inscriptions, and much of it trailed low in the dust and was withered already.
<p/>Stepping in for a moment at the open gate, and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who had no business there, I saw the auctioneer's clerk walking on the casks and telling them off for the information of a catalogue-compiler, pen in hand, who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had so often pushed along to the tune of Old Clem.
<p/>Mr. Pumblechook -LRB-not improved in appearance by his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) late nocturnal adventure-RRB- was waiting for me, and addressed me in the following terms:--
<p/>When I got back to my breakfast in the Boar's coffee-room, I found Mr. Pumblechook conversing with the landlord. '' Young man, I am sorry to see you brought low.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) extended his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and as I was broken by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took it.
<p/>But what else could be expected! what else could be expected! '' '' William,'' said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter, <div class="bookquote">``put a muffin on table.
<p/>Mr. Pumblechook stood over me and poured out my tea--before I could touch the teapot--with the air of a benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last.
<p/>And has it come to this! Has it come to this! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div>I frowningly sat down to my breakfast. '' William,'' said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, <div class="bookquote">``put the salt on.
<p/>In happier times,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>addressing me, <div class="bookquote">``I think you took sugar? And did you take milk? You did. Sugar and milk. William, bring a watercress.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't eat 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) head several times, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) might have expected that, and as if abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, shortly, <div class="bookquote">``but I don't eat watercresses. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' True. The simple fruits of the earth. No. You needn't bring any, William.
<p/>I went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to stand over me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) always did.
<p/>And yet when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) went from here -LRB-I may say with my blessing-RRB-, and I spread afore him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) my humble store, like the Bee, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) was as plump as a Peach!''
<p/>This reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) hand in my new prosperity, saying, <div class="bookquote">``May I?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and the ostentatious clemency with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) had just now exhibited the same fat five fingers.
<p/>'' '' Little more than skin and bone!'' mused Mr. Pumblechook, aloud. '' '' Hah! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) went on, handing me the bread and butter.
<p/>'' And air you a going to Joseph?'' <div class="bookquote">``In heaven's name,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, firing in spite of myself, <div class="bookquote">``what does it matter to you where I am going?
<p/>Leave that teapot alone. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave Pumblechook the opportunity he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) wanted.
<p/>Yes, young man,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), releasing the handle of the article in question, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, <div class="bookquote">``I will leave that teapot alone.
<p/>I forgit myself when I take such an interest in your breakfast, as to wish your frame, exhausted by the debilitating effects of prodigygality, to be stimilated by the `olesome nourishment of your forefathers.
<p/>And yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>waiter</b></font>)</div>said Pumblechook, turning to the landlord and waiter, and pointing me out at arm's length, <div class="bookquote">``this is him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) as I ever sported with in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) days of happy infancy!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>You are right, young man. For once you are right. Tell me not it cannot be; I tell you this is him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''
<p/>A low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to be particularly affected. '' This is him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>),'' said Pumblechook, <div class="bookquote">``as I have rode in my shay-cart.
<p/>This is him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) untoe the sister of which I was uncle by marriage, as her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) name was Georgiana M'ria from her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own mother, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) deny it if he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) can!
<p/>This is him (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) as I have seen brought up by hand. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>The waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gave the case a black look.
<p/>'' Young man,'' said Pumblechook, screwing his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) head at me in the old fashion, <div class="bookquote">``you air a going to Joseph. What does it matter to me, you ask me, where you air a going?
<p/>I say to you, Sir, you air a going to Joseph. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>The waiter coughed, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) modestly invited me to get over that.
<p/>Now,'' said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air of saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and conclusive, <div class="bookquote">``I will tell you what to say to Joseph.
<p/>Here is Squires of the Boar present, known and respected in this town, and here is William, which his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) father's name was Potkins if I do not deceive myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You do not, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>said William. '' In their presence,'' pursued Pumblechook, <div class="bookquote">``I will tell you, young man, what to say to Joseph.
<p/>I will name no names, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) up town, and I have seen that man.''

<p/>'' Say you said that, and even Joseph will probably betray surprise.'' '' There you quite mistake him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>),'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``I know better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Says you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>Pumblechook went on, ''' Joseph, I have seen that man, and that man bears you no malice and bears me no malice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows your character, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness and ignorance; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) knows my character, Joseph, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) knows my want of gratitoode.
<p/>Yes, Joseph,' says you,'' here Pumblechook shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) head and hand at me, ''`he (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) knows my total deficiency of common human gratitoode.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pumblechook</b></font>) knows it, Joseph, as none can. You do not know it, Joseph, having no call to know it, but that man do.'
<p/>'' Windy donkey as he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) was, it really amazed me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) could have the face to talk thus to mine.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Says you, `Joseph, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) gave me a little message, which I will now repeat. It was that, in my being brought low, he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) saw the finger of Providence.

It pinted out this writing, Joseph. Reward of ingratitoode to his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) earliest benefactor, and founder of fortun's.
<p/>It was right to do it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) would do it again.'
<p/>It's pity,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted breakfast, <div class="bookquote">``that the man did not say what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done and would do again.
<p/>But that man said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not repent of what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done, Joseph. Not at all. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' ``Squires of the Boar!
<p/>I have no objections to your mentioning, either up town or down town, if such should be your wishes, that it was right to do it, kind to do it, benevolent to do it, and that I would do it again.
<p/>With those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, with an air, and left the house; leaving me much more astonished than delighted by the virtues of that same indefinite <div class="bookquote">``it.
<p/>I was not long after him (<font color='blue'><b>Squires</b></font>) in leaving the house too, and when I went down the High Street I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Squires</b></font>) holding forth -LRB-no doubt to the same effect-RRB- at his (<font color='blue'><b>Squires</b></font>) shop door to a select group, who honored me with very unfavorable glances as I passed on the opposite side of the way.
<p/>But, it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe, whose great forbearance shone more brightly than before, if that could be, contrasted with this brazen pretender.
<p/>I went towards them slowly, for my limbs were weak, but with a sense of increasing relief as I drew nearer to them, and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness further and further behind.
<p/>The sky was blue, the larks were soaring high over the green corn, I thought all that countryside more beautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet.
<p/>Many pleasant pictures of the life that I would lead there, and of the change for the better that would come over my character when I had a guiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord, <div class="bookquote">``and William! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Pumblechook/Pumblechook</b></font>)</div>'' The June weather was delicious. I had proved, beguiled my way.
<p/>They awakened a tender emotion in me; for my heart was softened by my return, and such a change had come to pass, that I felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel, and whose wanderings had lasted many years.
<p/>The schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen; but, the little roundabout lane by which I entered the village, for quietness' sake, took me past it.
<p/>Some hopeful notion of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), busily engaged in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) daily duties, before she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated.
<p/>But the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards it under the sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe's hammer.
<p/>Long after I ought to have heard it, and long after I had fancied I heard it and found it but a fancy, all was still.
<p/>The limes were there, and the white thorns were there, and the chestnut-trees were there, and their leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen; but, the clink of Joe's hammer was not in the midsummer wind.
<p/>Almost fearing, without knowing why, to come in view of the forge, I saw it at last, and saw that it was closed.
<p/>I was disappointed to find that the day was a holiday; no children were there, and Biddy's house was closed. No gleam of fire, no glittering shower of sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, and still.
<p/>But the house was not deserted, and the best parlor seemed to be in use, for there were white curtains fluttering in its window, and the window was open and gay with flowers.
<p/>I went softly towards it, meaning to peep over the flowers, when Joe and Biddy stood before me, arm in arm.
<p/>At first Biddy gave a cry, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) thought it was my apparition, but in another moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was in my embrace.
<p/>I wept to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wept to see me; I, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) looked so fresh and pleasant; she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), because I looked so worn and white.
<p/>'' But dear Biddy, how smart you are!'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear Pip. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>'' And Joe, how smart you are!'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, dear old Pip, old chap.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked at both of them, from one to the other, and then-- <div class="bookquote">``It's my wedding-day! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness, <div class="bookquote">``and I am married to Joe!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>They had taken me into the kitchen, and I had laid my head down on the old deal table. Biddy held one of my hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) lips, and Joe's restoring touch was on my shoulder.
<p/>'' Which he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) warn't strong enough, my dear, fur to be surprised,'' said Joe. And Biddy said, <div class="bookquote">``I ought to have thought of it, dear Joe, but I was too happy.
<p/>They were both so overjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so touched by my coming to them, so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their day complete!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>My first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never breathed this last baffled hope to Joe. How often, while he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was with me in my illness, had it risen to my lips!
<p/>Dear Biddy,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``you have the best husband in the whole world, and if you could have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) by my bed you would have--
<p/>How irrevocable would have been his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knowledge of it, if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had remained with me but another hour! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But no, you couldn't love him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) better than you do.''
<p/>And, dear Joe, you have the best wife in the whole world, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) will make you as happy as even you deserve to be, you dear, good, noble Joe!''
<p/>'' No, I couldn't indeed,'' said Biddy. '' Joe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) sleeve before his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>And Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church to-day, and are in charity and love with all mankind, receive my humble thanks for all you have done for me, and all I have so ill repaid!
<p/>And when I say that I am going away within the hour, for I am soon going abroad, and that I shall never rest until I have worked for the money with which you have kept me out of prison, and have sent it to you, don't think, dear Joe and Biddy, that if I could repay it a thousand times over, I suppose I could cancel a farthing of the debt I owe you, or that I would do so if I could!''
<p/>'' They were both melted by these words, and both entreated me to say no more. '' But I must say more.
<p/>Dear Joe, I hope you will have children to love, and that some little fellow will sit in this chimney-corner of a winter night, who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for ever.
<p/>; don't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), Biddy, that I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) that I honored you both, because you were both so good and true, and that, as your child, I said it would be natural to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to grow up a much better man than I did.
<p/>Don't tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), Joe, that I was thankless '' '' I ain't a going,'' said Joe, from behind his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) sleeve, <div class="bookquote">``to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) nothink o' that natur, Pip.
<p/>And now, though I know you have already done it in your own kind hearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive me!
<p/>Pray let me hear you say the words, that I may carry the sound of them away with me, and then I shall be able to believe that you can trust me, and think better of me, in the time to come!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div><p/>Nor Biddy ain't. Nor yet no one ain't.'' '' <div class="bookquote">``O dear old Pip, old chap,''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Mrs. Joe/Joe Gargery</b></font>)</div>said Joe. '' God knows as I forgive you, if I have anythink to forgive!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amen! And God knows I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Biddy</b></font>)</div>echoed Biddy. '' Now let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there a few minutes by myself.
<p/>And then, when I have eaten and drunk with you, go with me as far as the finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, before we say good-bye!
<p/>** I sold all I had, and put aside as much as I could, for a composition with my creditors,--who gave me ample time to pay them in
<p/>Within a month, I had quitted England, and within two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co., and within four months I assumed my first undivided responsibility.
<p/>For the beam across the parlor ceiling at Mill Pond Bank had then ceased to tremble under old Bill Barley's growls and was at peace, and Herbert had gone away to marry Clara, and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch until he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) back.
<p/>Many a year went round before I was a partner in the House; but I lived happily with Herbert and his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) wife, and lived frugally, and paid my debts, and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Joe.
<p/>It was not until I became third in the Firm, that Clarriker betrayed me to Herbert; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) then declared that the secret of Herbert's partnership had been long enough upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) conscience, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) must tell it.

<p/>I must not leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great House, or that we made mints of money.
<p/>We were not in a grand way of business, but we had a good name, and worked for our profits, and did very well.
<p/>We owed so much to Herbert's ever cheerful industry and readiness, that I often wondered how I had conceived that old idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) inaptitude, until I was one day enlightened by the reflection, that perhaps the inaptitude had never been in him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) at all, but had been in me.
<p/>and I were not the worse friends for the long concealment. Chapter LIX For eleven years, I had not seen Joe nor Biddy with my bodily eyes,--though
<p/>they had both been often before my fancy in the East,--when, upon an evening in December, an hour or two after dark
<p/>, I laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door. I touched it so softly that I was not heard, and looked in unseen.
<p/>There, smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight, as hale and as strong as ever, though a little gray, sat Joe; and there, fenced into the corner with Joe's leg, and sitting on my own little stool looking at the fire, was--I again!
<p/>We giv' him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) the name of Pip for your sake, dear old chap,'' said Joe, delighted, when I took another stool by the child's side -LRB-but

<p/>I thought so too, and I took him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) out for a walk next morning, and we talked immensely, understanding one another to perfection.
<p/>And I took him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) down to the churchyard, and set him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) on a certain tombstone there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the memory of Philip Pirrip, late of this Parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above.

<p/>Biddy looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) child, and put its little hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) lips, and then put the good matronly hand with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) had touched it into mine.
<p/>There was something in the action, and in the light pressure of Biddy's wedding-ring, that had a very pretty eloquence in it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dear Pip</b></font>)</div>'' Dear Pip,'' said Biddy, <div class="bookquote">``you are sure you don't fret for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>)?''

<p/>Nevertheless, I knew, while I said those words, that I secretly intended to revisit the site of the old house that evening, alone, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) sake.
<p/>I had heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) as leading a most unhappy life, and as being separated from her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) husband, who had used her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) with great cruelty, and who had become quite renowned as a compound of pride, avarice, brutality, and meanness.
<p/>Yes, even so. For Estella's sake. And I had heard of the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) husband, from an accident consequent on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) ill-treatment of a horse.
<p/>The early dinner hour at Joe's, left me abundance of time, without hurrying my talk with Biddy, to walk over to the old spot before dark.
<p/>But, what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think of old times, the day had quite declined when I came to the place.
<p/>This release had befallen her (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) some two years before; for anything I knew, she (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was married again. There was no house now, no brewery, no building whatever left, but the wall of the old garden.
<p/>The cleared space had been enclosed with a rough fence, and looking over it, I saw that some of the old ivy had struck root anew, and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin.
<p/>A gate in the fence standing ajar, I pushed it open, and went in. A cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon, and the moon was not yet up to scatter it.
<p/>I could trace out where every part of the old house had been, and where the brewery had been, and where the gates, and where the casks.
<p/>But, the stars were shining beyond the mist, and the moon was coming, and the evening was not dark. I had done so, and was looking along the desolate garden walk, when I beheld a solitary figure in it.
<p/>The figure showed itself aware of me, as I advanced. It had been moving towards me, but it stood still. As I drew nearer, I saw it to be the figure of a woman.
<p/>As I drew nearer yet, it was about to turn away, when it stopped, and let me come up with it.
<p/>Then, it faltered, as if much surprised, and uttered my name, and I cried out,-- <div class="bookquote">``Estella!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>``I am greatly changed. I wonder you know me.
<p/>Those attractions in it, I had seen before; what I had never seen before, was the saddened, softened light of the once proud eyes; what I had never felt before was the friendly touch of the once insensible hand.
<p/>We sat down on a bench that was near, and I said, <div class="bookquote">``After so many years, it is strange that we should thus meet again, Estella, here where our first meeting was!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The freshness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribable majesty and its indescribable charm remained. Do you often come back?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nor I.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The moon began to rise, and I thought of the placid look at the white ceiling, which had passed away.
<p/>The moon began to rise, and I thought of the pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had heard on earth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have never been here since.''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>Estella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us. '' I have very often hoped and intended to come back, but have been prevented by many circumstances.
<p/>The silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight, and the same rays touched the tears that dropped from her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Not knowing that I saw them, and setting herself to get the better of them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said quietly,-- <div class="bookquote">``Were you wondering, as you walked along, how it came to be left in this condition?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor, poor old place! '' '' Yes, Estella.'' '' The ground belongs to me. It is the only possession I have not relinquished.
<p/>Everything else has gone from me, little by little, but I have kept this. It was the subject of the only determined resistance I made in all the wretched years.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it to be built on?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``At last, it is. I came here to take leave of it before its change.
<p/>And you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer,--<div class="bookquote">``you live abroad still?''  (<font color='red'><b>a wanderer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Still.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' And do well, I am sure?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I work pretty hard for a sufficient living, and therefore--yes, I do well. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have often thought of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div>said Estella.
<p/>There was a long hard time when I kept far from me the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant of its worth.
<p/>But since my duty has not been incompatible with the admission of that remembrance, I have given it a place in my heart.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Of late, very often. <div class="bookquote">``You have always held your place in my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. And we were silent again until she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) spoke.
<p/>'' I little thought,'' said Estella, <div class="bookquote">``that I should take leave of you in taking leave of this spot. I am very glad to do so.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Estella/Miss Estella/ESTELLA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Glad to part again, Estella? To me, parting is a painful thing. To me, the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>And if you could say that to me then, you will not hesitate to say that to me now,--now, when suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be.
<p/>'' But you said to me,'' returned Estella, very earnestly, ''' God bless you, God forgive you!' I have been bent and broken,
<p/>but--I hope--into a better shape. Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me we are friends.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``We are friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, rising and bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) rose from the bench. '' And will continue friends apart,'' said Estella.
<p/>I took her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>) hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as the morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so the evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of tranquil light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting from her (<font color='blue'><b>Estella</b></font>).
