after migrating to the united states rand didnt think of writing anthem but reconsidered after reading short story in the saturday evening post set in the future
ayn rand initially conceived anthem as play when she was teenager living in soviet russia seeing that mainstream magazines would publish speculative fiction she decided to try submitting anthem to them
she wrote the story in the summer of while taking break from research she was doing for her next novel the fountainhead
leonard peikoff explains the meaning behind this title is implicitly upholding the central principles of her philosophy and of her heroes reason values volition individualism
thinking that the original title was too blunt unemotional and would give away too much of the theme rand changed the title to anthem
it was not difficult therefore to change the working title to move from ego to ode or anthem leaving the object celebrated by the ode to be discovered by the reader
the present novel in miss rand mind was from the outset an ode to man ego there are similarities between anthem and the novel
we by yevgeny zamyatin another author who had lived in communist russia a novel taking the form of secret diary or journal
people are identified by codes instead of names children separated from their parents and brought up by the state individualism disposed of in favor of collective #will#
a male protagonist who discovers individuality through his relationship with female character a forest as free place outside the dystopian city
the protagonist discovers link to the past when people were free in tunnel under the earth there are also number of differences between the two stories
for example the society of we is in no scientific or technological decay featuring rays airplanes microphones and so on
in contrast the people of anthem believe that the world is flat and the sun revolves around it and that bleeding people is decent form of medicine
however there is little evidence that rand was influenced by or even read zamyatin work and she never mentioned it in discussions of her life in russia
the similarities have led to speculation about whether rand story was directly influenced by zamyatin anthem was reprinted in the june issue of the pulp magazine famous fantastic mysteries
initially rand planned on publishing anthem as magazine story or serial but her agent encouraged her to publish it as book
she submitted it simultaneously to macmillan publishers in america and cassell in england both had handled her previous novel we the living
cassell agreed to publish anthem but macmillan declined it according to peikoff comment was the author does not understand socialism another american publisher also turned it down and rand agent was unable to sell it as magazine serial
after the success of the fountainhead revised edition of anthem was published in the us in by pamphleteers inc small libertarian oriented publishing house owned by rand friends leonard read and william a anniversary edition was published in including an appendix which reproduces the cassell edition with rand handwritten editorial changes
cassell published it in england in since its publication in the revised version of anthem has sold more than million copies
the original uk edition received mostly positive reviews several praised rand imagination and her support of individualism in the sunday times reviewer dilys powell complimented its simplicity and sincerity
anti communist journalist malcolm muggeridge gave mixed review in the daily telegraph saying it had appeal but its dystopia was not believable
short review by maurice richardson in the observer said it was highly unconvincing in spite of some extremely eloquent writing reviewing the american edition for genre audience anthony boucher and francis mccomas were unsympathetic
saying that rand implies that sinister conspiracy of purveyors of brotherhood has prevented its american publication until now they ironically concluded one can only regret that the conspiracy finally broke down
the libertarian futurist society awarded anthem its hall of fame award in in anthem was nominated for retrospective hugo award for best novella
following the release of anthem in the united states rand explored opportunities for having it adapted to other media she had discussions about potential film opera and ballet adaptations but these projects were never realized
in rand wrote to walt disney that if screen adaptation were possible i would like to see it done in stylized drawings rather than with living actors
in a radio adaptation was done for the freedom story weekly radio program produced by spiritual mobilization christian libertarian group in it was released as an unabridged audiobook by abn the narration by jason mccoy described as tirring and evocative
the book was adapted into stage play in by jeff britting the department manager of the ayn rand archives at the ayn rand institute
in michael paxton wrote directed and co produced stage adaptation of anthem which appeared at the lex theater in hollywood first performed in denver it opened off broadway in september at the jerome robbins theater
instead of illustrating ideas this sporadically interesting show too often delivers exposition desperate to overexplain rather than risk moment of misunderstanding
the new york times review stated for play that celebrates the individual anthem sure doesnt trust its audience the novella also inspired spoof rock musical premiering off broadway at the lynn redgrave theatre in may
the review in the new york times criticized the acting of the leads but called the show exuberant and better than straight adaptation
the cast included randy jones of the village people jason gotay jenna leigh green remy zaken and ashley kate adams in anthem was adapted into graphic novel by charles santino with artwork by joe staton
in a second graphic novel adaptation was produced unrelated to the adaptation adapted by jennifer grossman and dan parsons the work has inspired many musical pieces including full length albums
according to enzo stuarti pat boone composed the music and his friend frank lovejoy wrote the lyrics of the song prelude featured in the album stuarti arrives at carnegie hall
in another point of the song it reads i guard my treasures my thought my #will# my land and my freedom
the song begins with line right out of anthem and the greatest of these is freedom in anthem it reads
i guard my treasures my thought my #will# my land my freedom and the greatest of these is freedom a memo to rand dated
robert silverberg novel time of changes also depicts society where is forbidden word and where the protagonist rebels against this prohibition
in preface to reprint edition of his novel silverberg said he had read anthem in but had long forgotten it when he wrote time of changes
he was surprised to see the similarities when he rediscovered rand story but said overall the two books are very different
anthem is also credited by neil peart for influencing rush with strong parallels to the plot structure and theme of anthem
peart has said that although he had read anthem he was not consciously thinking of the story when he wrote the song however when the similarities were pointed out he realized that there must have been some unconscious influence and gave credit to the genius of ayn rand in the liner notes
the band also released song called anthem on their fly by night album and their canadian record label co founded by rush manager ray danniels is anthem records
the story rand read was probably by the waters of babylon by stephen vincent benét which was published as the place of the gods in the july issue of the post
