<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate, indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) sister's marriage, been mistress of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) house from a very early period.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) mother had died too long ago for her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) caresses; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.
<p/>Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of Emma.
<p/>Produced by An Anonymous Volunteer EMMA By Jane Austen VOLUME I CHAPTER Between them it was more the intimacy of sisters.
<p/>Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) temper had hardly allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) own.
<p/>The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having rather too much her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) many enjoyments.
<p/>The danger, however, was at present so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Sorrow came--a gentle sorrow--but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness.--Miss Taylor married.
<p/>It was Miss Taylor's loss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance.
<p/>The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father composed himself to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had then only to sit and think of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had lost.
<p/>Mr. Weston was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self-denying, generous friendship she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had always wished and promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/>The event had every promise of happiness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend. The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) past kindness--the kindness, the affection of sixteen years--how she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) had taught and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) had played with her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) from five years old--how she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) had devoted all her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) powers to attach and amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) in health--and how nursed her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) through the various illnesses of childhood.
<p/>A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of hers--one to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) could speak every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) as could never find fault.
<p/>How was she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) to bear the change?--It was true that her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend was going only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) advantages, natural and domestic, she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) dearly loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) father, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was no companion for her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) in conversation, rational or playful.
<p/>The evil of the actual disparity in their ages -LRB-and Mr. Woodhouse had not married early-RRB- was much increased by his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) constitution and habits; for having been a valetudinarian all his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) life, without activity of mind or body, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was a much older man in ways than in years; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) heart and his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) amiable temper, his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) talents could not have recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) at any time.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) daily reach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) husband, and their little children, to fill the house, and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) pleasant society again.
<p/>Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town, to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and name, did really belong, afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) no equals.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had many acquaintance in the place, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father was universally civil, but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day.
<p/>It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was used to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind.
<p/>Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was by no means yet reconciled to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) but with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) had spent all the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) life at Hartfield.
<p/>Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could, to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) not to say exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had said at dinner,
<p/>The Woodhouses were first in consequence there. All looked up to them. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spirits required support. <div class="bookquote">``Poor Miss Taylor!--I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) were here again.
<p/>What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot.
<p/>Mr. Weston is such a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) thoroughly deserves a good wife;--and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) might have a house of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) own?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A house of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) own!--But where is the advantage of a house of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) own? This is three times as large.--And
<p/>you have never any odd humours, my dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!--We shall be always meeting!
<p/>We must begin; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' My dear, how am I to get so far?
<p/>Randalls is such a distance. I could not walk half so far. '' <div class="bookquote">``No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage, to be sure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>James</b></font>)</div><p/>But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way;--and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The carriage! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa. You know we have settled all that already.
<p/>And as for James, you may be very sure he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) will always like going to Randalls, because of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) daughter's being housemaid there.
<p/>We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last night. I only doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) will ever take us anywhere else.
<p/>That was your doing, papa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>)--James is so obliged to you!''
<p/>It was very lucky, for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) will make a very good servant
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very glad I did think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>). : she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) is a civil, pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>).
<p/>Whenever I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you have had her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) here to do needlework, I observe she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it.
<p/>I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) is used to see.
<p/>Whenever James goes over to see his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) daughter, you know, she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) will be hearing of us. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) will be able to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) how we all are.
<p/>Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father tolerably through the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own.
<p/>Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had returned to a late dinner, after some days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a servant</b></font>)</div>The backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time.
<p/>Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) good; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) many inquiries after <div class="bookquote">``poor Isabella''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) children were answered most satisfactorily.
<p/>When this was over, Mr. Woodhouse gratefully observed, <div class="bookquote">``It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come out at this late hour to call upon us.
<p/>I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not catch cold.'' <div class="bookquote">``Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes.
<p/>Not a speck on them. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain here.
<p/>It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding.
<p/>Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well.
<p/>'' '' By the bye--I have not wished you joy. How did you all behave? Who cried most?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! poor Miss Taylor! '
<p/>Tis a sad business. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say `poor Miss Taylor.'
<p/>I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!--At any rate, it must be better to have only one to please than two.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>That is what you have in your head, I know--and what you would certainly say if my father were not by.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Especially when one of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma playfully. '' <div class="bookquote">``I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse, with a sigh.
<p/>'' I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome.'' '' My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean you , or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean you .
<p/>What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only myself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know--in a joke--it is all a joke.
<p/>Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) of them: and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew it would be so much less so to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would not have him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) really suspect such a circumstance as her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) not being thought perfect by every body.
<p/>We always say what we like to one another. '' '' Emma knows I never flatter her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>),'' said Mr. Knightley, <div class="bookquote">``but I meant no reflection on any body.
<p/>Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please; she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) will now have but one. The chances are that she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) must be a gainer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div><p/>Well,'' said Emma, willing to let it pass--<div class="bookquote">``you want to hear about the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved charmingly.
<p/>Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen.
<p/>Oh no; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting every day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>But, Mr. Knightley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) will miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) thinks for.
<p/>'' '' Dear Emma bears every thing so well,'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father. '' '' Emma turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head, divided between tears and smiles.
<p/>We should not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so well as we do, sir, if we could suppose it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor's advantage; she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor's time of life, to be settled in a home of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) own, and how important to her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure.
<p/>'' It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion,'' said Mr. Knightley. '' Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) so happily married.''
<p/>And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,'' said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``and a very considerable one--that I made the match myself.
<p/>I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may comfort me for any thing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' Mr. Knightley shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) head at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father fondly replied, <div class="bookquote">``Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever you say always comes to pass.
<p/>Pray do not make any more matches. ''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for other people.
<p/>It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such success, you know!--Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry again.
<p/>Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied either in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) business in town or among his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) friends here, always acceptable wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) went, always cheerful--Mr.
<p/>Oh dear, no! Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not like it. Oh no!
<p/>Some people even talked of a promise to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) deathbed, and others of the son and the uncle not letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).
<p/>Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again. All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I believed none of it.
<p/>Ever since the day--about four years ago--that Miss Taylor and I met with him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject.
<p/>I planned the match from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off match-making.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Your time has been properly and delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I do not understand what you mean by `success,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley. '' Success supposes endeavour. A worthy employment for a young lady's mind!
<p/>But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, 'I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>),' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success?
<p/>Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You made a lucky guess; and that is all that can be said.
<p/>'' '' And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?--I pity you.--I thought you cleverer--for, depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck.
<p/>And as to my poor word `success,' which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it.
<p/>You have drawn two pretty pictures; but I think there may be a third--a something between the do-nothing and the do-all.
<p/>If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's visits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might not have come to any thing after all.
<p/>A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational, unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their own concerns.
<p/>There is always some talent in it. I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that.'' '' You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than good to them, by interference.

<p/>I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I have of doing him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) a service.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good young man, and I have a great regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>But if you want to shew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) any attention, my dear, ask him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to come and dine with us some day.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better thing.
<p/>Invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to dinner, Emma, and help him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to the best of the fish and the chicken, but leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to chuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own wife.
<p/>That will be a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>Depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself.''
<p/>Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family, which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had received a good education, but, on succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) brothers were engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) county, then embodied.
<p/>Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) military life had introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to Miss Churchill, of a great Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), nobody was surprized, except her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) brother and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wife, who had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and who were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend.
<p/>Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) fortune--though her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate--was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) off with due decorum.
<p/>Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) think every thing due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) in return for the great goodness of being in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); but though she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had one sort of spirit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had not the best.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had resolution enough to pursue her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own will in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) brother, but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) former home.
<p/>CHAPTER II It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce much happiness. They lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe
<p/>: she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not cease to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) husband, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.
<p/>Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills, as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of the bargain; for when his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife died, after a three years' marriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain.
<p/>The boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and
<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) decease.
<p/>Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had only his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) own comfort to seek, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) own situation to improve as he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) could.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) quitted the militia and engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in London, which afforded him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) a favourable opening.
<p/>From the expense of the child, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was soon relieved. A complete change of life became desirable. It was a concern which brought just employment enough.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had still a small house in Highbury, where most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) leisure days were spent; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty years of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) life passed cheerfully away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had, by that time, realised an easy competence--enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had always longed for--enough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) own friendly and social disposition.
<p/>It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, it had not shaken his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) determination of never settling till he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were accomplished.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) fortune, bought his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) house, and obtained his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had never been an unhappy man; his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) own temper had secured him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) from that, even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) first marriage; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) second must shew him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) how delightful a well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had only himself to please in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) choice: his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) fortune was his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) own; for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) uncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) assume the name of Churchill on coming of age.
<p/>The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) believed, so deservedly dear.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son every year in London, and was proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>); and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) fond report of him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) merits and prospects a kind of common concern.
<p/>Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively curiosity to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) prevailed, though the compliment was so little returned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had never been there in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) life.
<p/>It was most unlikely, therefore, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) should ever want his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's assistance. His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father had no apprehension of it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) coming to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father had been often talked of but never achieved.
<p/>Now, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a most proper attention, that the visit should take place.
<p/>There was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit.
<p/>Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had written to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) new mother on the occasion.
<p/>For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received. ''
<p/>I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed.
<p/>Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) never saw such a handsome letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) life.
<p/>Mrs. Weston had, of course, formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) great good sense, and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) marriage had already secured.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) felt herself a most fortunate woman; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had lived long enough to know how fortunate she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) knew that at times she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must be missed; and could not think, without pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour's ennui, from the want of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble character; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was more equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) situation than most girls would have been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped would bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) well and happily through its little difficulties and privations.
<p/>And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston's disposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) satisfaction--her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) more than satisfaction--her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent, that Emma, well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, was sometimes taken by surprize at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) being still able to pity `poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) go away in the evening attended by her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) pleasant husband to a carriage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) own.
<p/>'' It was, indeed, a highly prized letter. But never did she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh, and saying, <div class="bookquote">``Ah, poor Miss Taylor!
<p/>There was no recovering Miss Taylor--nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>); but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse.
<p/>The compliments of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) neighbours were over; he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), was all eat up.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) would be very glad to stay. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could never believe other people to be different from himself.
<p/>What was unwholesome to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) regarded as unfit for any body; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly tried to prevent any body's eating it.
<p/>Mr. Perry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could not but acknowledge -LRB-though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination-RRB- that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with many--perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately.
<p/>With such an opinion, in confirmation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) benevolent nerves till it was all gone.
<p/>There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had been at the pains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. CHAPTER III Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) liked very much to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) friends come and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>); and from various united causes, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) long residence at Hartfield, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) good nature, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) fortune, his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) house, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could command the visits of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own little circle, in a great measure, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) liked.
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own terms.
<p/>Fortunately for him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many such.
<p/>Not unfrequently, through Emma's persuasion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>): but evening parties were what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) preferred; and, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card-table for him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).
<p/>Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room, and the smiles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.
<p/>After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle; Had it taken place only once a year, it would have been a grievance.
<p/>Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) single daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward circumstances, can excite.
<p/>Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) into outward respect.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had never boasted either beauty or cleverness.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) youth had passed without distinction, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible.
<p/>And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was a happy woman, and a woman whom no one named without good-will. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) own universal good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) loved every body, was interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted to every body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing.
<p/>The simplicity and cheerfulness of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) nature, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) contented and grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to herself.
<p/>Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School--not of a seminary, or an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality, upon new principles and new systems--and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity--but a real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into a little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies.
<p/>Mrs. Goddard's school was in high repute--and very deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) own hands.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) was a great talker upon little matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless gossip. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) to church.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) was a plain, motherly kind of woman, who had worked hard in her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) youth, and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr. Woodhouse's kindness, felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) particular claim on her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) could, and win or lose a few sixpences by his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) fireside.
<p/>These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect; and happy was she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's sake, in the power; though, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was delighted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) father look comfortable, and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had fearfully anticipated.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>); a most welcome request:
<p/>for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) beauty.
<p/>A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion. Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody.
<p/>Somebody had placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school, and somebody had lately raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) from the condition of scholar to that of parlour-boarder.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>).
<p/>This was all that was generally known of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) history. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) was a very pretty girl, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was short, plump, and fair, with a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) manners as her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) person, and quite determined to continue the acquaintance.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's conversation, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) altogether very engaging--not inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk--and yet so far from pushing, shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had been used to, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) must have good sense, and deserve encouragement.
<p/>Those soft blue eyes, and all those natural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions.
<p/>Encouragement should be given. The acquaintance she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had already formed were unworthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>). The friends from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had just parted, though very good sort of people, must be doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) harm.
<p/>They were a family of the name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell--very creditably, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) believed--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them--but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would notice her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would improve her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would detach her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bad acquaintance, and introduce her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) into good society; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would form her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) opinions and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) manners.
<p/>It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own situation in life, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) leisure, and powers.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which always closed such parties, and for which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been used to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to the fire, before she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was aware.
<p/>With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas, did she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) then do all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) youth, but his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hospitality would have welcomed his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) visitors to every thing, his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) care for their health made him (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grieve that they would eat.
<p/>Such another small basin of thin gruel as his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own was all that he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things, to say: <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs.
<p/>Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse's feelings were in sad warfare. An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an egg better than any body.
<p/>I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see--one of our small eggs will not hurt you.
<p/>Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a little bit of tart--a very little bit. Ours are all apple-tarts. You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here.
<p/>I do not advise the custard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to half a glass of wine? A small half-glass, put into a tumbler of water?
<p/>Emma allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father to talk--but supplied her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) visitors in a much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy.
<p/>I do not think it could disagree with you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) intentions.
<p/>Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) all the evening, and actually shaken hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) at last!
<p/>Quick and decided in her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, and telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, so did their satisfaction in each other.
<p/>CHAPTER IV Harriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. As a walking companion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might find her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father never went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) long walk, or his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. Weston's marriage her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) exercise had been too much confined.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore, one whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could summon at any time to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) privileges.
<p/>But in every respect, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) saw more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) approved her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), and was confirmed in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) kind designs.
<p/>Harriet certainly was not clever, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had a sweet, docile, grateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be guided by any one she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) looked up to.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) early attachment to herself was very amiable; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) inclination for good company, and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no want of taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected.
<p/>Altogether she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly the young friend she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) wanted--exactly the something which her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) home required.
<p/>In that respect Mrs. Weston's loss had been important. Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could never be granted.
<p/>Two such she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not want. It was quite a different sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem.
<p/>Harriet would be loved as one to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could be useful. For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents, but Harriet could not tell.
<p/>Emma was obliged to fancy what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) liked--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could never believe that in the same situation she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) should not have discovered the truth.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was ready to tell every thing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) power, but on this subject questions were vain. Harriet had no penetration.
<p/>Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the school in general, formed naturally a great part of the conversation--and but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole.
<p/>But the Martins occupied her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thoughts a good deal; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had spent two very happy months with them, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) visit, and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place.
<p/>Emma encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) talkativeness--amused by such a picture of another set of beings, and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs. Martin's having '' two parlours, two very good parlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard's drawing-room; and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) having an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty years with her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>); and of their having eight cows, two of them Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch cow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was so fond of it, it should be called her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) cow; and of their having a very handsome summer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all to drink tea:--a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen people.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>); and looked no farther. ''
<p/>For some time she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate cause; but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) came to understand the family better, other feelings arose.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and daughter, a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it appeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was always mentioned with approbation for his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) great good-nature in doing something or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs. Martin, no wife in the case; she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) did suspect danger to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) were not taken care of, she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) might be required to sink herself forever.
<p/>With this inspiriting notion, her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) questions increased in number and meaning; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin, and there was evidently no dislike to it.
<p/>Harriet was very ready to speak of the share he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) being so very good-humoured and obliging.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) some walnuts, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had said how fond she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was of them, and in every thing else he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was so very obliging.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) shepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was very fond of singing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had a very fine flock, and, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was with them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had been bid more for his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) wool than any body in the country.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could sing a little himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was very clever, and understood every thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) believed every body spoke well of him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>).
<p/>Mrs. Martin had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) one day -LRB-and there was a blush as she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) said it,-RRB- that it was impossible for any body to be a better son, and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was sure, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) married, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would make a good husband.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother and sisters were very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). Not that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to marry. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was in no hurry at all.
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose--the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever seen.
<p/>Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with her (<font color='blue'><b>Richardson</b></font>).''
<p/>'' Well done, Mrs. Martin! '' thought Emma. '' You know what you are about.'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) own business?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) does not read?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh yes!--that is, no--I do not know-- but I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has read a good deal--but not what you would think any thing of.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) reads the Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the window seats--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) reads all them to himself.
<p/>But sometimes of an evening, before we went to cards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) would read something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining.
<p/>And I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has read the Vicar of Wakefield. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The Children of the Abbey.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had never heard of such books before I mentioned them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is determined to get them now as soon as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) can.
<p/>'' The next question was-- '' What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh! not handsome--not at all handsome. I thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) very plain at first, but I do not think him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) so plain now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is in Highbury every now and then, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is sure to ride through every week in his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) way to Kingston.
<p/>One does not, you know, after a time. But did you never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has passed you very often.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>That may be, and I may have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) fifty times, but without having any idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot, is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity.
<p/>A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other.
<p/>But a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense, as much above my notice as in every other he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) is below it.
<p/>The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do. '' '' To be sure.
<p/>Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) knows you very well indeed--I mean by sight.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) being a very respectable young man. I know, indeed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) is so, and, as such, wish him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) well.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference--which is very odd.
<p/>What do you imagine his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) age to be?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry.
<p/>They seem very comfortable as they are, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were to take any pains to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would probably repent it.
<p/>Six years hence, if he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) own, with a little money, it might be very desirable.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) would be thirty years old!''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>'' Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are not born to an independence.
<p/>Whatever money he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) might come into when his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) father died, whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) share of the family property, it is, I dare
<p/>Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) fortune entirely to make--cannot be at all beforehand with the world. say, all afloat, all employed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) stock, and so forth; and
<p/>though, with diligence and good luck, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) may be rich in time, it is next to impossible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) should have realised any thing yet.
<p/>They have no indoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy another year.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) does marry;--I mean, as to being acquainted with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wife--for though his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected to, it does not follow that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might marry any body at all fit for you to notice.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. '' The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates.
<p/>There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman's daughter, and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you.''
<p/>But while I visit at Hartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any body can do.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I would have you so firmly established in good society, as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse.
<p/>I want to see you permanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted with the wife, who will probably be some mere farmer's daughter, without education.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education--and been very well brought up.
<p/>However, I do not mean to set up my opinion against yours--and I am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) wife.
<p/>I shall always have a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be very sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me.
<p/>But if he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not visit her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), if I can help it.
<p/>'' Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. '' '' To be sure. Yes. '' Emma watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no alarming symptoms of love.
<p/>The young man had been the first admirer, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no serious difficulty, on Harriet's side, to oppose any friendly arrangement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own.
<p/>They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the Donwell road. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) companion.
<p/>Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few yards forward, while they talked together, soon made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) appearance was very neat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) looked like a sensible young man, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) person had no other advantage; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) came to be contrasted with gentlemen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) must lose all the ground he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had gained in Harriet's inclination.
<p/>Harriet was not insensible of manner; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had voluntarily noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father's gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr. Martin looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) did not know what manner was.
<p/>They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with a smiling face, and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose.
<p/>'' Only think of our happening to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)!--How very odd! It was quite a chance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) said, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had not gone round by Randalls.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) did not think we ever walked this road. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) thought we walked towards Randalls most days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was so busy the last time he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was at Kingston that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) quite forgot it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) goes again to-morrow.
<p/>So very odd we should happen to meet! Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) like what you expected? What do you think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)?
<p/>Do you think him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) so very plain?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is very plain, undoubtedly--remarkably plain:--but that is nothing compared with his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) entire want of gentility.
<p/>I had no right to expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could be so very clownish, so totally without air.
<p/>I had imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), I confess, a degree or two nearer gentility.'' '' To be sure,'' said Harriet, in a mortified voice, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is not so genteel as real gentlemen.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin.
<p/>I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to be a very inferior creature--and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) at all agreeable before.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>At Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred men. Do not you begin to feel that now?
<p/>I am sure you must have been struck by his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) awkward look and abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood here.
<p/>Were not you struck? '' <div class="bookquote">``Certainly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is not like Mr. Knightley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has not such a fine air and way of walking as Mr. Knightley.
<p/>I see the difference plain enough. But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>'' Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr. Martin with him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) .
<p/>You might not see one in a hundred with gentleman so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to.
<p/>What say you to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of them . Compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent.
<p/>You must see the difference.'' '' Oh yes!--there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an old man. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty.
<p/>, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or awkwardness becomes.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Which makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) good manners the more valuable. The older a person grows What is passable in youth is detestable in later age.
<p/>Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) be at Mr. Weston's time of life?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>'' There is no saying, indeed,'' replied Harriet rather solemnly.
<p/>'' But there may be pretty good guessing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) will be a completely gross, vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of nothing but profit and loss.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How much his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) business engrosses him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) already is very plain from the circumstance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else--which is just as it should be, for a thriving man.
<p/>And I have no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will thrive, and be a very rich man in time--and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being illiterate and coarse need not disturb us .''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not remember the book'' (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>--was all Harriet's answer, and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Will he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), indeed? That will be very bad. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>What has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do with books? She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), therefore, said no more for some time.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) next beginning was, <div class="bookquote">``In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior to Mr. Knightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness.
<p/>There is an openness, a quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) , because there is so much good-humour with it--but that would not do to be copied.
<p/>Neither would Mr. Knightley's downright, decided, commanding sort of manner, though it suits him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) very well; his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) figure, and look, and situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to set about copying him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not be sufferable.
<p/>They might be more safely held up as a pattern. On the contrary, I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model.
<p/>I do not know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us, Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) manners are softer than they used to be.
<p/>Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) means any thing, it must be to please you.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) then repeated some warm personal praise which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had drawn from Mr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.
<p/>Did not I tell you what he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) said of you the other day? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet's head.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thought it would be an excellent match; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to have much merit in planning it.
<p/>It was not likely, however, that any body should have equalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in the date of the plan, as it had entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) brain during the very first evening of Harriet's coming to Hartfield.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) feared it was what every body else must think of and predict. The longer she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) considered it, the greater was her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) sense of its expediency.
<p/>Mr. Elton's situation was most suitable, quite the gentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had a comfortable home for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), and Emma imagined a very sufficient income; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was known to have some independent property; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought very highly of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had already satisfied herself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought Harriet a beautiful girl, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, was foundation enough on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side; and on Harriet's there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have all the usual weight and efficacy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was reckoned very handsome; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) person much admired in general, though not by her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), there being a want of elegance of feature which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not dispense with:--but
<p/>the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin's riding about the country to get walnuts for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton's admiration.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was really a very pleasing young man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like. CHAPTER V
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley, <div class="bookquote">``of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it a bad thing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing?--why so?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think they will neither of them do the other any good.
<p/>Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>``You surprize me! I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very differently we feel!--Not think they will do each other any good!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.
<p/>This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr. Knightley.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>'' '' Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) were here, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) thinks exactly as I do on the subject.
<p/>We were speaking of it only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to associate with.
<p/>You are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value of a companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own sex, after being used to it all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life.
<p/>Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case. I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith.
<p/>But on the other hand, as Emma wants to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) better informed, it will be an inducement to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to read more herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is not the superior young woman which Emma's friend ought to be. They will read together. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) means it, I know.
<p/>I have seen a great many lists of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) drawing-up at various times of books that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) meant to read regularly through--and very good lists they were--very well chosen, and very neatly arranged--sometimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule.
<p/>The list she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) drew up when only fourteen--I remember thinking it did her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) judgment so much credit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) may have made out a very good list now.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was twelve years old. But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma.
<p/>Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing.--You never could persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) to read half so much as you wished.--You know you could not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding. <div class="bookquote">``I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``that I thought so then ;
<p/>There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as that ,'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>--said Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had done.
<p/>But I,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) soon added, <div class="bookquote">``who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, must still see, hear, and remember.
<p/>--but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's omitting to do any thing I wished.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) family.
<p/>At ten years old, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sister at seventeen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was always quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident.
<p/>And ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mother she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lost the only person able to cope with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on your recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted another situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) inherits her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mother's talents, and must have been under subjection to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held.
<p/>'' '' Yes,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), smiling. '' You are better placed here ; very fit for a wife, but not at all for a governess.
<p/>You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) , on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and doing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) a wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor.''
<p/>But you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. <div class="bookquote">``Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as Mr. Weston.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne.
<p/>We will not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son may plague him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hope not that .--It is not likely.
<p/>No, Mr. Knightley, do not foretell vexation from that quarter.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma's genius for foretelling and guessing.
<p/>I hope, with all my heart, the young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune.--But Harriet Smith--I have not half done about Harriet Smith.
<p/>I think her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is a flatterer in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority?
<p/>And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) cannot gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) out of conceit with all the other places she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) belongs to.
<p/>I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) situation in life.--They only give a little polish.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) home. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am more anxious for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! you would rather talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) person than her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind, would you?

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such an eye!--the true hazle eye--and so brilliant! regular features, open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health, and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure!
<p/>One hears sometimes of a child being `the picture of health;' now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health.
<p/>There is health, not merely in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bloom, but in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) air, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) glance.

I love to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and I will add this praise, that I do not think her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) personally vain.
<p/>Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm.''
<p/>Considering how very handsome she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) appears to be little occupied with it; her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) vanity lies another way. '' And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm.
<p/>With all dear Emma's little faults, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is an excellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder sister, or a truer friend?
<p/>; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has qualities which may be trusted; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will never lead any one really wrong; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will make no lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is in the right a hundred times.
<p/>No, no '' ``Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel, and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella.
<p/>John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection, and Isabella always thinks as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) does; except when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is not quite frightened enough about the children.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know that you all love her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) really too well to be unjust or unkind; but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty -LRB-I consider myself, you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma's mother might have had-RRB- the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith's intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you.
<p/>Pray excuse me; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be expected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, who perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself.
<p/>It has been so many years my province to give advice, that you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this little remains of office.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I am sure of having their opinions with me. '' <div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I am much obliged to you for it.

<p/>It would not be a bad thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to be very much in love with a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) good.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to break her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) resolution at present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston, <div class="bookquote">``as can well be; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse's account.
<p/>But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) goes so seldom from home.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma, though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you.
<p/>Part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own and Mr. Weston's on the subject, as much as possible.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was quite convinced of Mr. Elton's being in the fairest way of falling in love, if not in love already.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>'' convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had no scruple with regard to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) talked of Harriet, and praised her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) so warmly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) perception of the striking improvement of Harriet's manner, since her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) introduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) growing attachment.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was a beautiful creature when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) came to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) received from nature.

<p/>I have perhaps given her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) a little more decision of character, have taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) to think on points which had not fallen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) way before.
<p/>I have done very little.'' '' If it were admissible to contradict a lady,'' said the gallant Mr. Elton-- '' ''
<p/>'' Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much superadded decision of character! Skilful has been the hand!'' <div class="bookquote">``Great has been the pleasure, I am sure.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) seconded a sudden wish of hers, to have Harriet's picture.

<p/>dear, no, never. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>I would give any money for it. I almost long to attempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) likeness myself. You do not know it
<p/>two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of my friends, and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general.
<p/>I dare say, but But from one cause or another, I gave it up in disgust. But really, I could almost venture, if Harriet would sit to me.
<p/>It would be such a delight to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) picture!'' <div class="bookquote">``Let me entreat you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Elton; <div class="bookquote">``it would indeed be a delight!
<p/>Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend. I know what your drawings are.
<p/>Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable figure-pieces in her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) drawing-room, at Randalls?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div><p/>How could you suppose me ignorant? Yes, good man!--thought Emma--but what has all that to do with taking likenesses? You know nothing of drawing.
<p/>Don't pretend to be in raptures about mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet's face. '' Well, if you give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try what I can do.
<p/>Harriet's features are very delicate, which makes a likeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch.
<p/>'' '' Exactly so--The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth--I have not a doubt of your success.
<p/>Pray, pray attempt it. As you will do it, it will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession.
<p/>'' '' But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thinks so little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own beauty.
<p/>Did not you observe her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) manner of answering me? How completely it meant, `why should my picture be drawn?''' '' Oh!
<p/>yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still I cannot imagine she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would not be persuaded.
<p/>Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others.
<p/>Emma wished to go to work directly, and therefore produced the portfolio containing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) various attempts at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they might decide together on the best size for Harriet.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had always wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would ever submit to.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) played and sang;--and drew in almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting; and in nothing had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) approached the degree of excellence which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would have been glad to command, and ought not to have failed of.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not much deceived as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own skill either as an artist or a musician, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not unwilling to have others deceived, or sorry to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved.
<p/>There was merit in every drawing--in the least finished, perhaps the most; her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there been ten times more,
<p/>'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) many beginnings were displayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths, pencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn. the delight and admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) two companions would have been the same.
<p/>They were both in ecstasies. A likeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be capital. '' No great variety of faces for you,'' said Emma.
<p/>There is my father--another of my father--but the idea of sitting for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) picture made him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so nervous, that I could only take him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) by stealth; neither of them very like therefore.
<p/>'' I had only my own family to study from. Mrs. Weston again, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston!
<p/>always my kindest friend on every occasion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would sit whenever I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). There is my sister; and really quite her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own little elegant figure!--and the face not unlike.
<p/>I should have made a good likeness of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would have sat longer, but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was in such a hurry to have me draw her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) four children that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would not be quiet.
<p/>Then, here come all my attempts at three of those four children;--there they are, Henry and John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of them might do for any one of the rest.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are coarser featured than any of mama's children ever were.
<p/>I took him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was sleeping on the sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) cockade as you would wish to see.
<p/>Here is my sketch of the fourth, who was a baby. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had nestled down his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head most conveniently. That's very like.
<p/>I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa is very good. Then here is my last,''--unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size,
<p/>whole-length--<div class="bookquote">``my last and my best--my brother, Mr. John Knightley.--This did not want much of being finished, when I put it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness.
<p/>I could not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I had really made a very good likeness of it---LRB-Mrs.
<p/>Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it very like-RRB---only too handsome--too flattering--but that was a fault on the right side'' (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>--after all this, came poor
<p/>dear Isabella's cold approbation of--``Yes , it was a little like--but to be sure it did not do him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) justice. We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to sit at all.
<p/>It was made a great favour of; and altogether it was more than I could bear; and so I never would finish it, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square;--and, as I said, I did then forswear ever drawing any body again.
<p/>But for Harriet's sake, or rather for my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at present , I will break my resolution now.
<p/>Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and was repeating, <div class="bookquote">``No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as you observe.
<p/>No husbands and wives,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>with so interesting a consciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not better leave them together at once.
<p/>'' Exactly so. But as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted to be drawing, the declaration must wait a little longer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait.
<p/>It was to be a whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley's, and was destined, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could please herself, to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece.
<p/>The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) credit for stationing himself where he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) might gaze and gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to it, and request him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) to place himself elsewhere.
<p/>But there was no doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) and watching every touch. It then occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to employ him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) in reading.
<p/>'' If he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness indeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) part, and lessen the irksomeness of Miss Smith's.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to be still frequently coming to look; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the progress, and be charmed.--There
<p/>was no being displeased with such an encourager, for his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) admiration made him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) discern a likeness almost before it was possible.
<p/>'' Mr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not respect his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) eye, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) love and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) complaisance were unexceptionable.
<p/>The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was quite enough pleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on.
<p/>There was no want of likeness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more height, and considerably more elegance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both--a standing memorial of the beauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton's very promising attachment was likely to add.
<p/>Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) ought, entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.
<p/>The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction, took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the picture, which was rapid and happy.
<p/>'' By all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party. '' Every body who saw it was pleased, but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through every criticism.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) wanted,''--observed Mrs. Weston to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)--not in the least suspecting that she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was addressing a lover.--<div class="bookquote">``The expression of the eye is most correct, but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>Miss Woodhouse has given her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) friend the only beauty It is the fault of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) face that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) has them not.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). '' I cannot agree with you. It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature.
<p/>I never saw such a likeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know. '' <div class="bookquote">``You have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) too tall, Emma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley.
<p/>Emma knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly added, <div class="bookquote">``Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall.
<p/>Consider, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is sitting down--which naturally presents a different--which in short gives exactly the idea--and the proportions must be preserved, you know.
<p/>Proportions , fore-shortening.--Oh no! it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith's. Exactly so indeed! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is very pretty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse. '' So prettily done! Just as your drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so well as you do.
<p/>The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) seems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) shoulders--and it makes one think she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must catch cold.''
<p/>'' But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer. Look at the tree.'' ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You, sir, may say any thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Elton, <div class="bookquote">``but I must confess that I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out of doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit!
<p/>But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>Any other situation would have been much less in character.
<p/>The naivete of Miss Smith's manners--and altogether--Oh, it is most admirable! I cannot keep my eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness.
<p/>It must be done directly; it must be done in London; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions, must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) stirring out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) house in the fogs of December.
<p/>'' The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a few difficulties. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton, than it was removed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) gallantry was always on the alert. '' Might he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure should he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) have in executing it!
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) could ride to London at any time. It was impossible to say how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) should be gratified by being employed on such an errand.''
<p/>good!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) could not endure the thought!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) would not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) such a troublesome office for the world,''--brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances,--and a very few minutes settled the business.
<p/>Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and give the directions; and Emma thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was too '' What a precious deposit!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) with a tender sigh, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) received it. '' This man is almost too gallant to be in love,'' thought Emma.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is an excellent young man, and will suit Harriet exactly; it will be an `Exactly so,' as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) says himself; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) does sigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a principal.
<p/>'' I should say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love. I come in for a pretty good share as a second.
<p/>But it is his (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) gratitude on Harriet's account.'' CHAPTER VII The very day of Mr. Elton's going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma's services towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend.
<p/>Harriet had been at Hartfield, as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to return again to dinner: she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) returned, and sooner than had been talked of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something extraordinary to have happened which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was longing to tell.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had heard, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) got back to Mrs. Goddard's, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, and finding she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a little parcel for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) from one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) sisters, and gone away; and on opening this parcel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had actually found, besides the two songs which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this letter was from him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal of marriage.
<p/>Half a minute brought it all out. '' Who could have thought it? She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was so surprized she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did not know what to do.
<p/>Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good letter , at least she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thought so. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) wrote as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) really loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) very much--
<p/>but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did not know-- and so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was come as fast as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) should do.--
<p/>'' Emma was half-ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful. '' Upon my word,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will connect himself well if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Will you read the letter? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Harriet. '' Pray do. I'd rather you would.
<p/>'' Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) read, and was surprized. The style of the letter was much above her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) expectation.
<p/>There were not merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of the writer.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) paused over it, while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) opinion, with a <div class="bookquote">``Well, well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>and was at last forced to add, <div class="bookquote">``Is it a good letter?
<p/>It was short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment, liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling. or is it too short?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Yes, indeed, a very good letter,'' replied Emma rather slowly--<div class="bookquote">``so good a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) sisters must have helped him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>).
<p/>I can hardly imagine the young man whom I saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if left quite to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman; no, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a woman.
<p/>No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural talent for--thinks strongly and clearly-- and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes a pen in hand, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts naturally find proper words.
<p/>It is so with some men. Yes, I understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a certain point, not coarse.
<p/>A better written letter, Harriet -LRB-returning it,-RRB- than I had expected. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' Well,'' said the still waiting Harriet;--<div class="bookquote">``well--and--and what shall I do?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>'' What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this letter?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' But what are you in doubt of?
<p/>You must answer it of course--and speedily.'' '' Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me.'' ''
<p/>Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will express yourself very properly, I am sure.
<p/>no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude and concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will present themselves unbidden to your mind, I am persuaded.
<p/>There is no danger of your not being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be unequivocal; You need not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) disappointment.''
<p/>'' You think I ought to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) then,'' said Harriet, looking down. '' Ought to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)! My dear Harriet, what do you mean?
<p/>Are you in any doubt as to that? I thought--but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been under a mistake.
<p/>I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer. I had imagined you were consulting me only as to the wording of it.
<p/>'' Harriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued: <div class="bookquote">``You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, I do not; that is, I do not mean --What shall I do? What would you advise me to do?
<p/>Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to do. '' <div class="bookquote">``I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to do with it.
<p/>This is a point which you must settle with your feelings.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I had no notion that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) liked me so very much,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>said Harriet, contemplating the letter.
<p/>For a little while Emma persevered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought it best to say, <div class="bookquote">``I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman doubts as to whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should accept a man or not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) certainly ought to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) can hesitate as to ' Yes,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ought to say `No' directly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful feelings, with half a heart.
<p/>I thought it my duty as a friend, and older than yourself, to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I want to influence you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to--but if you would just advise me what I had best do--
<p/>'' Oh! No, no, I do not mean that--As you say, one's mind ought to be quite made up-- One should not be hesitating--
<p/>It is a very serious thing.--It will be safer to say `No,' perhaps.--Do you think I had better say `No?' '' <div class="bookquote">``Not for the world,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, smiling graciously, ``would I advise you either way.
<p/>If you prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) the most agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you hesitate?
<p/>You must be the best judge of your own happiness. You blush, Harriet.--Does any body else occur to you at this moment under such a definition?
<p/>Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive yourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At this moment whom are you thinking of?
<p/>The symptoms were favourable.--Instead of answering, Harriet turned away confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was still in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without regard.
<p/>At last, with some hesitation, Harriet said-- <div class="bookquote">``Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as well as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really almost made up my mind--to refuse Mr. Martin.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>Emma waited the result with impatience, but not without strong hopes. Do you think I am right? '' <div class="bookquote">``Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just what you ought.
<p/>While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation in approving.
<p/>Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin.
<p/>While you were in the smallest degree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me.
<p/>I could not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am secure of you for ever. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>Harriet had not surmised her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own danger, but the idea of it struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) forcibly.
<p/>'' You could not have visited me!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) cried, looking aghast. '' No, to be sure you could not; but I never thought of that before.
<p/>an escape!--Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world.''
<p/>That would have been too dreadful!--What <div class="bookquote">``Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it must have been.
<p/>You would have thrown yourself out of all good society. I must have given you up. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Dear me!--How should I ever have borne it!
<p/>It would have killed me never to come to Hartfield any more!'' ``Dear affectionate creature!-- You banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!-- You confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life!
<p/>I wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have a pretty good opinion of himself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is conceited either, in general,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>said Harriet, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) conscience opposing such censure; <div class="bookquote">``at least, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is very good natured, and I shall always feel much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and have a great regard for--but that is quite a different thing from--and you know, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may like me, it does not follow that I should--and
<p/>certainly I must confess that since my visiting here I have seen people--and if one comes to compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all, one is so very handsome and agreeable.
<p/>However, I do really think Mr. Martin a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>); and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) being so much attached to me--and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) writing such a letter--but as to leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>A woman is not to marry a man merely because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is asked, or because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and can write a tolerable letter.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be parted. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh no;--and it is but a short letter too.
<p/>Emma felt the bad taste of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend, but let it pass with a <div class="bookquote">``very true; and it would be a small consolation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), for the clownish manner which might be offending her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) every hour of the day, to know that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband could write a good letter.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>'' '' Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always happy with pleasant companions.
<p/>Emma assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) there would be no difficulty in the answer, and advised its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence.
<p/>The looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) letter again, in replying to it, had such a softening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) up with a few decisive expressions; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was so very much concerned at the idea of making him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) unhappy, and thought so much of what his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother and sisters would think and say, and was so anxious that they should not fancy her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ungrateful, that Emma believed if the young man had come in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) way at that moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have been accepted after all.
<p/>I am quite determined to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But how shall I do? What shall I say? '' This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was rather low all the evening, but Emma could allow for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr. Elton.
<p/>The business was finished, and Harriet safe. '' I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,'' was said in rather a sorrowful tone.
<p/>'' Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. You are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to Abbey-Mill.''
<p/>'' And I am sure I should never want to go there ; for I am never happy but at Hartfield.
<p/>'' Some time afterwards it was, <div class="bookquote">``I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much surprized if she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) knew what had happened.
<p/>I am sure Miss Nash would--for Miss Nash thinks her (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) own sister very well married, and it is only a linen-draper.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher of a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an opportunity as this of being married.

<p/>The attentions of a certain person can hardly be among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I are the only people to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) looks and manners have explained themselves.
<p/>The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly cheering; but still, after a time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) was tender-hearted again towards the rejected Mr. Martin.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that people should like her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) so much. '' Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has got my letter,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) softly.
<p/>'' I wonder what they are all doing--whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) sisters know--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is unhappy, they will be unhappy too. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) will not mind it so very much.''
<p/>At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is shewing your picture to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful is the original, and after being asked for it five or six times, allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma. '' '' My picture!--But he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has left my picture in Bond-street.''
<p/>No, my dear little modest Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till just before he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) mounts his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) horse to-morrow.
<p/>It opens his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) designs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) family, it introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those pleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm prepossession.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) so!--Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. It is his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) companion all this evening, his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) solace, his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) delight. How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy their imaginations all are!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>For some weeks past she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been spending more than half her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) time there, and gradually getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in every respect, safest and kindest, to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with them as much as possible just at present.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard's, but it was then to be settled that she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) should return to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.
<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr. Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) mind to walk out, was persuaded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter not to defer it, and was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose.
<p/>Mr. Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), was offering by his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other.
<p/>Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour.
<p/>Harriet smiled again, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) smiles grew stronger. CHAPTER VIII Harriet slept at Hartfield that night. '' As the sun is out, I believe I had better take my three turns while I can.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitors</b></font>) presently added, with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) advantage.''

<p/>I have reason to think,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``that Harriet Smith will soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable quarter:--Robert Martin is the man.
<p/>Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) knew Mr. Elton looked up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) visit to Abbey-Mill, this summer, seems to have done his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) business.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is desperately in love and means to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>).'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is very obliging,'' said Emma; <div class="bookquote">``but is he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) sure that Harriet means to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well, well, means to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) an offer then. Will that do? He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) came to the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) knows I have a thorough regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) family, and, I believe, considers me as one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) best friends.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to settle so early; whether I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) too young: in short, whether I approved his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) choice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) being considered -LRB-especially since your making so much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)-RRB- as in a line of society above him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).
<p/>I was very much pleased with all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) said. I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) told me every thing; his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in the event of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) marriage.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is an excellent young man, both as son and brother.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) proved to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could not do better.
<p/>I had no hesitation in advising him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to marry. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) away very happy.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had never esteemed my opinion before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had.
<p/>Now, as we may fairly suppose, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would not allow much time to pass before he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) spoke to the lady, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) does not appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should be at Mrs. Goddard's to-day; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) may be detained by a visitor, without thinking him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) at all a tiresome wretch.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pray, Mr. Knightley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech, <div class="bookquote">``how do you know that Mr. Martin did not speak yesterday?''

<p/>I should not feel that I had done wrong. By your account, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) does seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever got over.''
<p/>Not Harriet's equal!'' exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, <div class="bookquote">``No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is not her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) equal indeed, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is as much her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) superior in sense as in situation.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any connexion higher than Robert Martin?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and certainly no respectable relations.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is known only as parlour-boarder at a common school. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any information.
<p/>At her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) age she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) can have no experience, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) little wit, is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is pretty, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is good tempered, and that is all.
<p/>My only scruple in advising the match was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) account, as being beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) deserts, and a bad connexion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>).
<p/>I felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) might do much better; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could not do worse.
<p/>But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) having that sort of disposition, which, in good hands, like his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), might be easily led aright and turn out very well.
<p/>The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) side; and had not the smallest doubt -LRB-nor have I now-RRB- that there would be a general cry-out upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) extreme good luck.
<p/>It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend's leaving Highbury, for the sake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) being settled so well.
<p/>Even your satisfaction I made sure of. I remember saying to myself, `Even Emma, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.'''
<p/>What! think a farmer, -LRB-and with all his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) sense and all his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,-RRB- a good match for my intimate friend!
<p/>Not regret her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any such thing. I wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings.
<p/>I assure you mine are very different. I must think your statement by no means fair. You are not just to Harriet's claims.
<p/>They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is undoubtedly her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) inferior as to rank in society.--The sphere in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) moves is much above his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>).--It would be a degradation.
<p/>As to the circumstances of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) birth, though in a legal sense she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) may be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is not to pay for the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is brought up.--There can scarcely be a doubt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father is a gentleman--and a gentleman of fortune.--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) allowance is very liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) improvement or comfort.--That she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is a gentleman's daughter, is indubitable to me; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) associates with gentlemen's daughters, no one, I apprehend, will deny.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is superior to Mr. Robert Martin.''

<p/>After receiving a very indifferent education she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is left in Mrs. Goddard's hands to shift as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) can;--to move, in short, in Mrs. Goddard's line, to have Mrs. Goddard's acquaintance.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) friends evidently thought this good enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>); and it was good enough.
<p/>Till you chose to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) into a friend, her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) mind had no distaste for her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) own set, nor any ambition beyond it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) desired nothing better herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had no sense of superiority then.
<p/>Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had not felt persuaded of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) not being disinclined to him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>).
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) has it now, you have given it. You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma. I know him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) well.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion. And as to conceit, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is the farthest from it of any man I know.
<p/>It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) chose rather to take up her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own line of the subject again.
<p/>Depend upon it he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had encouragement. '' '' You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before, are unjust to Harriet.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is not a clever girl, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) has better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) understanding spoken of so slightingly.
<p/>Waiving that point, however, and supposing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to be, as you describe her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), only pretty and good-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) possesses them, they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing from among many, consequently a claim to be nice.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) good-nature, too, is not so very slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great readiness to be pleased with other people.
<p/>I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such temper, the highest claims a woman could possess.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost enough to make me think so too.
<p/>Harriet's claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Better be without sense, than misapply it as you do.''
<p/>I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in--what at once bewitches his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses and satisfies his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) judgment.
<p/>'' To be sure!'' cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) playfully. '' I know that is the feeling of you all. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse.
<p/>And is she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), at seventeen, just entering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at because she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) does not accept the first offer she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) receives?
<p/>Were you, yourself, ever to marry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is the very woman for you. No--pray let her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) have time to look about her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley presently, <div class="bookquote">``though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet.
<p/>You will puff her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) up with such ideas of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own beauty, and of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) has a claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) reach will be good enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).
<p/>Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of mischief. Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) expectations too high.
<p/>Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is a very pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives.
<p/>Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity--and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in, when the mystery of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) parentage came to be revealed.
<p/>Let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) marry Robert Martin, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is safe, respectable, and happy for ever; but if you encourage her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to expect to marry greatly, and teach her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard's all the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) life--or, at least, -LRB-for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other,-RRB- till she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the old writing-master's son.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div><p/>'' We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that there can be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making each other more angry.
<p/>But as to my letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) marry Robert Martin, it is impossible; she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) has refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), and so decidedly, I think, as must prevent any second application.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must abide by the evil of having refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) a little; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) appearance is so much against him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) manner so bad, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) ever were disposed to favour him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is not now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was the brother of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) friends, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) took pains to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>); and altogether, having seen nobody better -LRB-that must have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) great assistant-RRB-
<p/>I can imagine, that before she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had seen any body superior, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) might tolerate him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) might not, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was at Abbey-Mill, find him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) disagreeable.
<p/>But the case is altered now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) knows now what gentlemen are; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet.''
<p/>Martin's manners have sense, sincerity, and good-humour to recommend them; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand.
<p/>Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) very much to be gone.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not repent what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had done; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) could be; but yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had a sort of habitual respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) judgment in general, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dislike having it so loudly against her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and to have him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) sitting just opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in angry state, was very disagreeable.
<p/>Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt on Emma's side to talk of the weather, but he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) made no answer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) goes; and from his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) general way of talking in unreserved moments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) does not mean to throw himself away.
<p/>I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) sisters are intimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece.
<p/>If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would have been very kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am very much obliged to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, laughing again. '' I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls.
<p/>I shall leave off while I am well.'' <div class="bookquote">``Good morning to you,'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), rising and walking off abruptly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was very much vexed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) felt the disappointment of the young man, and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had given; and the part which he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair, was provoking him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) exceedingly.
<p/>Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)'s, than in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) opinions were right and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) adversary's wrong, as Mr. Knightley.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) walked off in more complete self-approbation than he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) left for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). Harriet's staying away so long was beginning to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) uneasy.
<p/>The possibility of the young man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's that morning, and meeting with Harriet and pleading his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own cause, gave alarming ideas.
<p/>The dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any such reason to give for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) long absence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) felt a satisfaction which settled her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own mind, and convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had done nothing which woman's friendship and woman's feelings would not justify.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) a little about Mr. Elton; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) considered that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had done, neither with the interest, nor -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) must be allowed to tell herself, in spite of Mr. Knightley's pretensions-RRB- with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had spoken it hastily and in anger, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was able to believe, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had rather said what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wished resentfully to be true, than what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) knew any thing about.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) certainly might have heard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had ever done, and Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money matters; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives.
<p/>Mr. Knightley saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its effects; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest; and more than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was very sure did not belong to Mr. Elton.
<p/>Harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) came back, not to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton.
<p/>Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend a sick child, and Miss Nash had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had told Miss Nash, that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had met Mr. Elton, and found to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) road to London, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the whist-club night, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had been never known to miss before; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) about it, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) how shabby it was in him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>), their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) to put off his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) journey only one day; but it would not do; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a very particular way indeed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was going on business which he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would not put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a very enviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious.
<p/>Mr. Perry could not quite understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) was very sure there must be a lady in the case, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) so; and Mr. Elton only looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits.
<p/>Miss Nash had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) all this, and had talked a great deal more about Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) did not pretend to understand what his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) business might be, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) should think the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton had not his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) equal for beauty or agreeableness.
<p/>Miss Nash had been telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) something, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) repeated immediately with great delight. ''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER IX Mr. Knightley might quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>), but Emma could not quarrel with herself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was so much displeased, that it was longer than usual before he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) came to Hartfield again; and when they did meet, his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) grave looks shewed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) was not forgiven.
<p/>On the contrary, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) plans and proceedings were more and more justified and endeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) by the general appearances of the next few days.
<p/>The Picture, elegantly framed, came safely to hand soon after Mr. Elton's return, and being hung over the mantelpiece of the common sitting-room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) got up to look at it, and sighed out his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) half sentences of admiration just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) ought; and as for Harriet's feelings, they were visibly forming themselves into as strong and steady an attachment as her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) youth and sort of mind admitted.
<p/>Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr. Martin's being no otherwise remembered, than as he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) furnished a contrast with Mr. Elton, of the utmost advantage to the latter.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) views of improving her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) little friend's mind, by a great deal of useful reading and conversation, had never yet led to more than a few first chapters, and the intention of going on to-morrow.
<p/>It was much easier to chat than to study; much pleasanter to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) imagination range and work at Harriet's fortune, than to be labouring to enlarge her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) comprehension or exercise it on sober facts; and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present, the only mental provision she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was making for the evening of life, was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could meet with, into a thin quarto of hot-pressed paper, made up by her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend, and ornamented with ciphers and trophies.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was sorry, but could not repent. In this age of literature, such collections on a very grand scale are not uncommon.
<p/>Miss Nash, head-teacher at Mrs. Goddard's, had written out at least three hundred; and Harriet, who had taken the first hint of it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), hoped, with Miss Woodhouse's help, to get a great many more.
<p/>Emma assisted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) invention, memory and taste; and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand, it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order, in form as well as quantity.
<p/>Mr. Woodhouse was almost as much interested in the business as the girls, and tried very often to recollect something worth their putting in.
<p/>'' So many clever riddles as there used to be when he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was young--he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) wondered he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could not remember them! but he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) should in time.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) good friend Perry, too, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had spoken to on the subject, did not at present recollect any thing of the riddle kind; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had desired Perry to be upon the watch, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) went about so much, something, he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) thought, might come from that quarter.
<p/>'' And it always ended in <div class="bookquote">``Kitty, a fair but frozen maid. ''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>It was by no means his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) daughter's wish that the intellects of Highbury in general should be put under requisition.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) was invited to contribute any really good enigmas, charades, or conundrums that he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) might recollect; and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had the pleasure of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) most intently at work with his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) recollections; and at the same time, as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could perceive, most earnestly careful that nothing ungallant, nothing that did not breathe a compliment to the sex should pass his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) lips.
<p/>They owed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) their two or three politest puzzles; and the joy and exultation with which at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) recalled, and rather sentimentally recited, that well-known charade, My first doth affliction denote, Which my second is destin'd to feel
<p/>And my whole is the best antidote That affliction to soften and heal.-- made her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) quite sorry to acknowledge that they had transcribed it some pages ago already.
<p/>Mr. Elton was the only one whose assistance she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) asked. '' Why will not you write one yourself for us, Mr. Elton?
<p/>'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``that is the only security for its freshness; and nothing could be easier to you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Oh no! he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had never written, hardly ever,
<p/>any thing of the kind in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) life. The stupidest fellow! He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was afraid not even Miss Woodhouse''--he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) stopt a moment--<div class="bookquote">``or Miss Smith could inspire him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) called for a few moments, just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) said, a charade, which a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had addressed to a young lady, the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) admiration, but which, from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) manner, Emma was immediately convinced must be his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The very next day however produced some proof of inspiration. '' I do not offer it for Miss Smith's collection,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).
<p/>Being my friend's, I have no right to expose it in any degree to the public eye, but perhaps you may not dislike looking at it.
<p/>'' '' The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet, which Emma could understand. There was deep consciousness about him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) found it easier to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eye than her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend's.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was gone the next moment:--after another moment's pause, <div class="bookquote">``Take it,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Emma, smiling, and pushing the paper towards Harriet--<div class="bookquote">``it is for you.
<p/>But Harriet was in a tremor, and could not touch it; and Emma, never loth to be first, was obliged to examine it herself.
<p/>Take your own. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>To Miss-- CHARADE. My first displays the wealth and pomp of kings, Lords of the earth! their luxury and ease.

<p/>Man's boasted power and freedom, all are flown; Lord of the earth and sea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) bends a slave, And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cast her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eye over it, pondered, caught the meaning, read it through again to be quite certain, and quite mistress of the lines, and then passing it to Harriet, sat happily smiling, and saying to herself, while Harriet was puzzling over the paper in all the confusion of hope and dulness, <div class="bookquote">``Very well, Mr. Elton, very well indeed.
<p/>Thy ready wit the word will soon supply, May its approval beam in that soft eye! I have read worse charades.

<p/>Approve my charade and my intentions in the same glance.' May its approval beam in that soft eye! Harriet exactly. Soft is the very word for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) eye--of all epithets, the justest that could be given.
<p/>Thy ready wit the word will soon supply. Humph-- Harriet's ready wit! All the better. A man must be very much in love, indeed, to describe her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) so.
<p/>Ah! Mr. Knightley, I wish you had the benefit of this; I think this would convince you. For once in your life you would be obliged to own yourself mistaken.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was obliged to break off from these very pleasant observations, which were otherwise of a sort to run into great length, by the eagerness of Harriet's wondering questions.
<p/>An excellent charade indeed! and very much to the purpose. Things must come to a crisis soon now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>'' What can it be, Miss Woodhouse?--what can it be?
<p/>I have not an idea--I cannot guess it in the least. What can it possibly be? Do try to find it out, Miss Woodhouse.
<p/>Do help me. I never saw any thing so hard. Is it kingdom? I wonder who the friend was--and who could be the young lady.
<p/>Do you think it is a good one? Can it be woman? And woman, lovely woman, reigns alone. Can it be Neptune?
<p/>Behold him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) there, the monarch of the seas! Or a trident? or a mermaid? or a shark? Oh, no! shark is only one syllable.
<p/>It must be very clever, or he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would not have brought it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do you think we shall ever find it out?''
<p/>Where would be the use of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) bringing us a charade made by a friend upon a mermaid or a shark?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mermaids and sharks! Nonsense! My dear Harriet, what are you thinking of? Give me the paper and listen. For Miss ------, read Miss Smith.

<p/>I thought it must be so. Yes, Harriet, just so long have I been wanting the very circumstance to happen that has happened.
<p/>I could never tell whether an attachment between you and Mr. Elton were most desirable or most natural. Its probability and its eligibility have really so equalled each other!
<p/>I am very happy. I congratulate you, my dear Harriet, with all my heart. This is an attachment which a woman may well feel pride in creating.
<p/>It will give you every thing that you want--consideration, independence, a proper home--it will fix you in the centre of all your real friends, close to Hartfield and to me, and confirm our intimacy for ever.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear Miss Woodhouse!'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>--and Mr. Elton's superiority had very ample acknowledgment.

<p/>You and Mr. Elton are by situation called together ; you belong to one another by every circumstance of your respective homes.
<p/>There does seem to be a something in the air of Hartfield which gives love exactly the right direction, and sends it into the very channel where it ought to flow.
<p/>The course of true love never did run smooth-- A Hartfield edition of Shakespeare would have a long note on that passage.''

<p/>and I ran into the front room and peeped through the blind when we heard he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was going by, and Miss Nash came and scolded us away, and staid to look through herself; however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) called me back presently, and let me look too, which was very good-natured.
<p/>Dear me! When I look back to the first time I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)! How little did I think!--The two Abbots And how beautiful we thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) looked!
<p/>This is an alliance which, whoever--whatever your friends may be, must be agreeable to them, provided at least they have common sense; and we are not to be addressing our conduct to fools.
<p/>If they are anxious to see you happily married, here is a man whose amiable character gives every assurance of it;--if they wish to have you settled in the same country and circle which they have chosen to place you in, here it will be accomplished; and if their only object is that you should, in the common phrase, be well married, here is the comfortable fortune, the respectable establishment, the rise in the world which must satisfy them.''

<p/>Depend upon it, he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would not like to have his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) charade slighted, much better than his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) passion. A poet in love must be encouraged in both capacities, or neither.
<p/>Harriet submitted, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mind could hardly separate the parts, so as to feel quite sure that her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend were not writing down a declaration of love.
<p/>Give me the book, I will write it down, and then there can be no possible reflection on you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It seemed too precious an offering for any degree of publicity.
<p/>'' I shall never let that book go out of my own hands,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). '' Very well,'' replied Emma; <div class="bookquote">``a most natural feeling; and the longer it lasts, the better I shall be pleased.
<p/>But here is my father coming: you will not object to my reading the charade to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). It will be giving him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so much pleasure!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) loves any thing of the sort, and especially any thing that pays woman a compliment. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has the tenderest spirit of gallantry towards us all!--You
<p/>My dear Harriet, you must not refine too much upon this charade.--You will betray your feelings improperly, if you are too conscious and too quick, and appear to affix more meaning, or even quite all the meaning which may be affixed to it.
<p/>must let me read it to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>Harriet looked grave. '' Do not be overpowered by such a little tribute of admiration.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been anxious for secrecy, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not have left the paper while I was by; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rather pushed it towards me than towards you.
<p/>Do not let us be too solemn on the business. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has encouragement enough to proceed, without our sighing out our souls over this charade.''
<p/>Mr. Woodhouse came in, and very soon led to the subject again, by the recurrence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) very frequent inquiry of <div class="bookquote">``Well, my dears, how does your book go on?--Have
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>Oh! no-- I hope I shall not be ridiculous about it. Do as you please. '' you got any thing fresh?''
<p/>A piece of paper was found on the table this morning---LRB-dropt, we suppose, by a fairy-RRB---containing a very pretty charade, and we have just copied it in.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) read it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) liked to have any thing read, slowly and distinctly, and two or three times over, with explanations of every part as she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) proceeded--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was very much pleased, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) had foreseen, especially struck with the complimentary conclusion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, papa; we have something to read you, something quite fresh. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Aye, that's very just, indeed, that's very properly said.
<p/>It is such a pretty charade, my dear, that I can easily guess what fairy brought it.--Nobody could have written so prettily, but you, Emma.
<p/>Very true. ' Woman, lovely woman.' '' Emma only nodded, and smiled.--After a little thinking, and a very tender sigh, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>it is no difficulty to see who you take after! Your dear mother was so clever at all those things! If I had but her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) memory!
<p/>But I can remember nothing;--not even that particular riddle which you have heard me mention; I can only recollect the first stanza; and there are several.
<p/>Kitty, a fair but frozen maid, Kindled a flame I yet deplore, The hood-wink'd boy I called to aid, Though of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) near approach afraid, So fatal to my suit before.
<p/>And that is all that I can recollect of it--but it is very clever all the way through. But I think, my dear, you said you had got it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, papa, it is written out in our second page. We copied it from the Elegant Extracts. It was Garrick's, you know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, very true.--I wish I could recollect more of it. Kitty, a fair but frozen maid. The name makes me think of poor Isabella; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was very near being christened Catherine after her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) grandmama.
<p/>I hope we shall have her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) here next week. Have you thought, my dear, where you shall put her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)--and what room there will be for the children?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh! yes--she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) will have her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) own room, of course; the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) always has;--and there is the nursery for the children,--just as usual, you know.
<p/>I do not know, my dear--but it is so long since she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was here!--not since last Easter, and then only for a few days.--Mr.
<p/>Why should there be any change?'' '' John Knightley's being a lawyer is very inconvenient.--Poor Isabella!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) is sadly taken away from us

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' I do not know, my dear. I am sure I was very much surprized when I first heard she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) was going to be married.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``We must ask Mr. and Mrs. Weston to dine with us, while Isabella is here.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, my dear, if there is time.--But---LRB-in a very depressed tone-RRB---she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) is coming for only one week.
<p/>There will not be time for any thing. '' <div class="bookquote">``It is unfortunate that they cannot stay longer--but it seems a case of necessity.
<p/>Mr. John Knightley must be in town again on the 28th, and we ought to be thankful, papa, that we are to have the whole of the time they can give to the country, that two or three days are not to be taken out for the Abbey.
<p/>Mr. Knightley promises to give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) claim this Christmas--though you know it is longer since they were with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), than with us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Woodhouse could never allow for Mr. Knightley's claims on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) brother, or any body's claims on Isabella, except his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) sat musing a little while, and then said, ``But I do not see why poor Isabella should be obliged to go back so soon, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) does.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be very hard, indeed, my dear, if poor Isabella were to be anywhere but at Hartfield. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I think, Emma, I shall try and persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to stay longer with us.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and the children might stay very well. '' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! papa--that is what you never have been able to accomplish, and I do not think you ever will.
<p/>Unwelcome as it was, Mr. Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh; and as Emma saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) spirits affected by the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter's attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them.
<p/>Isabella cannot bear to stay behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) husband. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This was too true for contradiction. '' Harriet must give us as much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) company as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) can while my brother and sister are here.
<p/>I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) will be pleased with the children. We are very proud of the children, are not we, papa?
<p/>I wonder which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) will think the handsomest, Henry or John?'' <div class="bookquote">``Aye, I wonder which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) will. Poor little dears, how glad they will be to come.
<p/>They are very fond of being at Hartfield, Harriet.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dare say they are, sir. I am sure I do not know who is not.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Henry is a fine boy, but John is very like his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mama. Henry is the eldest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was named after me, not after his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father.
<p/>Some people are surprized, I believe, that the eldest was not, but Isabella would have him (<font color='blue'><b>eldest</b></font>) called Henry, which I thought very pretty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>).
<p/>John, the second, is named after his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father. And he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is a very clever boy, indeed. They are all remarkably clever; and they have so many pretty ways.
<p/>They will come and stand by my chair, and say, `Grandpapa, can you give me a bit of string?' and once Henry asked me for a knife, but I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) knives were only made for grandpapas.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) appears rough to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``because you are so very gentle yourself; but if you could compare him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) with other papas, you would not think him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) rough.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wishes his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) boys to be active and hardy; and if they misbehave, can give them a sharp word now and then; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is an affectionate father--certainly Mr. John Knightley is an affectionate father.
<p/>I think their father is too rough with them very often. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' The children are all fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).'' ''
<p/>And then their uncle comes in, and tosses them up to the ceiling in a very frightful way!'' '' But they like it, papa; there is nothing they like so much.
<p/>It is such enjoyment to them, that if their uncle did not lay down the rule of their taking turns, whichever began would never give way to the other.''
<p/>'' Well, I cannot understand it.'' '' That is the case with us all, papa. One half of the world cannot understand the pleasures of the other.''
<p/>Later in the morning, and just as the girls were going to separate in preparation for the regular four o'clock dinner, the hero of this inimitable charade walked in again.
<p/>Harriet turned away; but Emma could receive him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) with the usual smile, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quick eye soon discerned in his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) the consciousness of having made a push--of having thrown a die; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) imagined he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was come to see how it might turn up.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) ostensible reason, however, was to ask whether Mr. Woodhouse's party could be made up in the evening without him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) should be in the smallest degree necessary at Hartfield.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) were, every thing else must give way; but otherwise his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) friend Cole had been saying so much about his (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) dining with him (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>)--had made such a point of it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) conditionally to come.
<p/>Emma thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>), but could not allow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) disappointing his (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) friend on their account; her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father was sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rubber.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) re-urged--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) re-declined; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seemed then about to make his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bow, when taking the paper from the table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) returned it--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! here is the charade you were so obliging as to leave with us; thank you for the sight of it.
<p/>We admired it so much, that I have ventured to write it into Miss Smith's collection. Your friend will not take it amiss I hope.
<p/>Of course I have not transcribed beyond the first eight lines. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mr. Elton certainly did not very well know what to say.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) looked rather doubtingly--rather confused; said something about <div class="bookquote">``honour,'' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>--glanced at Emma and at Harriet, and then seeing the book open on the table, took it up, and examined it very attentively.
<p/>With the view of passing off an awkward moment, Emma smilingly said, ``You must make my apologies to your friend; but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no hesitation in saying,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Elton, though hesitating a good deal while he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) spoke; <div class="bookquote">``I have no hesitation in saying--at least if my friend feels at all as I do--
<p/>I have not the smallest doubt that, could he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) see his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) little effusion honoured as I see it, -LRB-looking at the book again, and replacing it on the table-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would consider it as the proudest moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) may be sure of every woman's approbation while he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) writes with such gallantry.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' After this speech he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was gone as soon as possible.
<p/>Emma could not think it too soon; for with all his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) good and agreeable qualities, there was a sort of parade in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) speeches which was very apt to incline her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to laugh.
<p/>Though now the middle of December, there had yet been no weather to prevent the young ladies from tolerably regular exercise; and on the morrow, Emma had a charitable visit to pay to a poor sick family, who lived a little way out of Highbury.
<p/>Their road to this detached cottage was down Vicarage Lane, a lane leading at right angles from the broad, though irregular, main street of the place; and, as may be inferred, containing the blessed abode of Mr. Elton.
<p/>A few inferior dwellings were first to be passed, and then, about a quarter of a mile down the lane rose the Vicarage, an old and not very good house, almost as close to the road as it could be.
<p/>It had no advantage of situation; but had been very much smartened up by the present proprietor; and, such as it was, there could be no possibility of the two friends passing it without a slackened pace and observing eyes.--Emma's remark
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ran away to indulge the inclination, leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet's share. CHAPTER X was--
<p/>'' There it is. There go you and your riddle-book one of these days.''--Harriet's was-- '' Oh, what a sweet house!--How very beautiful!--There are the yellow curtains that Miss Nash admires so much.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not often walk this way now ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, as they proceeded, ``but then there will be an inducement, and I shall gradually get intimately acquainted with all the hedges, gates, pools and pollards of this part of Highbury.
<p/>Harriet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) found, had never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) life been inside the Vicarage, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) curiosity to see it was so extreme, that, considering exteriors and probabilities, Emma could only class it, as a proof of love, with Mr. Elton's seeing ready wit in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but I cannot think of any tolerable pretence for going in;--no servant that I want to inquire about of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) housekeeper--no message from my father.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I wish we could contrive it,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>); '' She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) pondered, but could think of nothing. After a mutual silence of some minutes, Harriet thus began again--
<p/>so charming as you are!''-- Emma laughed, and replied, <div class="bookquote">``My being charming, Harriet, is not quite enough to induce me to marry; I must find other people charming--one other person at least.
<p/>And I am not only, not going to be married, at present, but have very little intention of ever marrying at all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>-- Emma</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do so wonder, Miss Woodhouse, that you should not be married, or going to be married! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Ah!--so you say; but I cannot believe it.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I must see somebody very superior to any one I have seen yet, to be tempted; Mr. Elton, you know, -LRB-recollecting herself,-RRB- is out of the question: and I do not wish to see any such person.
<p/>I would rather not be tempted. I cannot really change for the better. If I were to marry, I must expect to repent it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Dear me!--it is so odd to hear a woman talk so!''-- '' I have none of the usual inducements of women to marry.
<p/>but I never have been in love; it is not my way, or my nature; and I do not think I ever shall.
<p/>Were I to fall in love, indeed, it would be a different thing! And, without love, I am sure I should be a fool to change such a situation as mine.
<p/>Fortune I do not want; employment I do not want; consequence I do not want: I believe few married women are half as much mistress of their husband's house as I am of Hartfield; and never, never could I expect to be so truly beloved and important; so always first and always right in any man's eyes as I am in my father's.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is as formidable an image as you could present, Harriet; and if I thought I should ever be like Miss Bates!
<p/>so silly--so satisfied--so smiling--so prosing--so undistinguishing and unfastidious--and so apt to tell every thing relative to every body about me, I would marry to-morrow.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>an maid</b></font>)</div>But then, to be an old maid at last, like Miss Bates!'' But between us , I am convinced there never can be any likeness, except in being unmarried.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, Harriet, I shall not be a poor old maid; and it is poverty only which makes celibacy contemptible to a generous public!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>an maid</b></font>)</div>But still, you will be an old maid! and that's so dreadful!'' A single woman, with a very narrow income, must be a ridiculous, disagreeable old maid!
<p/>the proper sport of boys and girls, but a single woman, of good fortune, is always respectable, and may be as sensible and pleasant as any body else.
<p/>And the distinction is not quite so much against the candour and common sense of the world as appears at first; for a very narrow income has a tendency to contract the mind, and sour the temper.
<p/>Those who can barely live, and who live perforce in a very small, and generally very inferior, society, may well be illiberal and cross.
<p/>This does not apply, however, to Miss Bates; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is only too good natured and too silly to suit me; but, in general, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is very much to the taste of every body, though single and though poor.
<p/>Poverty certainly has not contracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) mind: I really believe, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had only a shilling in the world, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) would be very likely to give away sixpence of it; and nobody is afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>): that is a great charm.''
<p/>If I know myself, Harriet, mine is an active, busy mind, with a great many independent resources; and I do not perceive why I should be more in want of employment at forty or fifty than one-and-twenty.
<p/>Woman's usual occupations of hand and mind will be as open to me then as they are now; or with no important variation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dear me! but what shall you do? how shall you employ yourself when you grow old?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' If I draw less, I shall read more; if I give up music, I shall take to carpet-work.
<p/>And as for objects of interest, objects for the affections, which is in truth the great point of inferiority, the want of which is really the great evil to be avoided in not marrying, I shall be very well off, with all the children of a sister I love so much, to care about.
<p/>There will be enough for every hope and every fear; and though my attachment to none can equal that of a parent, it suits my ideas of comfort better than what is warmer and blinder.
<p/>There will be enough of them, in all probability, to supply every sort of sensation that declining life can need. My nephews and nieces!--I shall often have a niece with me.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know Miss Bates's niece? That is, I know you must have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) a hundred times--but are you acquainted?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh! yes; we are always forced to be acquainted whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) comes to Highbury. By the bye, that is almost enough to put one out of conceit with a niece.
<p/>Heaven forbid! at least, that I should ever bore people half so much about all the Knightleys together, as she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) does about Jane Fairfax.
<p/>Every letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) is read forty times over; her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) compliments to all friends go round and round again; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) does but send her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) aunt the pattern of a stomacher, or knit a pair of garters for her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) grandmother, one hears of nothing else for a month.
<p/>One is sick of the very name of Jane Fairfax. I wish Jane Fairfax very well; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) tires me to death.
<p/>Emma was very compassionate; and the distresses of the poor were as sure of relief from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) personal attention and kindness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) counsel and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) patience, as from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) purse.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) understood their ways, could allow for their ignorance and their temptations, had no romantic expectations of extraordinary virtue from those for whom education had done so little; entered into their troubles with ready sympathy, and always gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) assistance with as much intelligence as good-will.
<p/>In the present instance, it was sickness and poverty together which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) came to visit; and after remaining there as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could give comfort or advice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quitted the cottage with such an impression of the scene as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) say to Harriet, as they walked away,
<p/>'' They were now approaching the cottage, and all idle topics were superseded. <div class="bookquote">``These are the sights, Harriet, to do one good.
<p/>How trifling they make every thing else appear!--I feel now as if I could think of nothing but these poor creatures all the rest of the day; and yet, who can say how soon it may all vanish from my mind?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And really, I do not think the impression will soon be over,'' said Emma, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) crossed the low hedge, and tottering footstep which ended the narrow, slippery path through the cottage garden, and brought them into the lane again.
<p/>I do not think it will,'' stopping to look once more at all the outward wretchedness of the place, and recall the still greater within.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>said Harriet. '' Poor creatures! one can think of nothing else.'' '' '' '' Oh! dear, no,'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) companion.
<p/>The lane made a slight bend; and when that bend was passed, Mr. Elton was immediately in sight; and so near as to give Emma time only to say farther, <div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>Well, -LRB-smiling,-RRB- I hope it may be allowed that if compassion has produced exertion and relief to the sufferers, it has done all that is truly important.
<p/>If we feel for the wretched, enough to do all we can for them, the rest is empty sympathy, only distressing to ourselves.
<p/>They walked on. Harriet, here comes a very sudden trial of our stability in good thoughts. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>Harriet could just answer, <div class="bookquote">``Oh!
<p/>dear, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>before the gentleman joined them. The wants and sufferings of the poor family, however, were the first subject on meeting.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) visit he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would now defer; but they had a very interesting parley about what could be done and should be done.
<p/>To fall in with each other on such an errand as this,'' thought Emma; <div class="bookquote">``to meet in a charitable scheme; this will bring a great increase of love on each side.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been going to call on them. Mr. Elton then turned back to accompany them. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>I should not wonder if it were to bring on the declaration.
<p/>Anxious to separate herself from them as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soon afterwards took possession of a narrow footpath, a little raised on one side of the lane, leaving them together in the main road.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not been there two minutes when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found that Harriet's habits of dependence and imitation were bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) up too, and that, in short, they would both be soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).
<p/>This would not do; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) immediately stopped, under pretence of having some alteration to make in the lacing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) half-boot, and stooping down in complete occupation of the footpath, begged them to have the goodness to walk on, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would follow in half a minute.
<p/>They did as they were desired; and by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) judged it reasonable to have done with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) boot, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had the comfort of farther delay in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) power, being overtaken by a child from the cottage, setting out, according to orders, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) pitcher, to fetch broth from Hartfield.
<p/>To walk by the side of this child, and talk to and question her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), was the most natural thing in the world, or would have been the most natural, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) been acting just then without design; and by this means the others were still able to keep ahead, without any obligation of waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) gained on them, however, involuntarily: the child's pace was quick, and theirs rather slow; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was the more concerned at it, from their being evidently in a conversation which interested them.
<p/>Mr. Elton was speaking with animation, Harriet listening with a very pleased attention; and Emma, having sent the child on, was beginning to think how she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might draw back a little more, when they both looked around, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was obliged to join them.
<p/>Mr. Elton was still talking, still engaged in some interesting detail; and Emma experienced some disappointment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was only giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) fair companion an account of the yesterday's party at his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) friend Cole's, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was come in herself for the Stilton cheese, the north Wiltshire, the butter, the celery, the beet-root, and all the dessert.
<p/>This would soon have led to something better, of course,'' was her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) consoling reflection; <div class="bookquote">``any thing interests between those who love; and any thing will serve as introduction to what is near the heart.
<p/>It must, if I were not here. I wish I were anywhere else. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' If I could but have kept longer away!
<p/>They now walked on together quietly, till within view of the vicarage pales, when a sudden resolution, of at least getting Harriet into the house, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) again find something very much amiss about her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) boot, and fall behind to arrange it once more.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) then broke the lace off short, and dexterously throwing it into a ditch, was presently obliged to entreat them to stop, and acknowledged her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) inability to put herself to rights so as to be able to walk home in tolerable comfort.
<p/>'' '' Part of my lace is gone,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and I do not know how I am to contrive. I really am a most troublesome companion to you both, but I hope I am not often so ill-equipped.
<p/>Mr. Elton, I must beg leave to stop at your house, and ask your housekeeper for a bit of ribband or string, or any thing just to keep my boot on.
<p/>Mr. Elton looked all happiness at this proposition; and nothing could exceed his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) alertness and attention in conducting them into his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) house and endeavouring to make every thing appear to advantage.
<p/>The room they were taken into was the one he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) chiefly occupied, and looking forwards; behind it was another with which it immediately communicated; the door between them was open, and Emma passed into it with the housekeeper to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) assistance in the most comfortable manner.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was obliged to leave the door ajar as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fully intended that Mr. Elton should close it.
<p/>It was not closed, however, it still remained ajar; but by engaging the housekeeper in incessant conversation, she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) hoped to make it practicable for him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to chuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own subject in the adjoining room.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>For ten minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) could hear nothing but herself. It could be protracted no longer. She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was then obliged to be finished, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) appearance.
<p/>The lovers were standing together at one of the windows. It had a most favourable aspect; and, for half a minute, Emma felt the glory of having schemed successfully.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had been most agreeable, most delightful; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had told Harriet that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had seen them go by, and had purposely followed them; other little gallantries and allusions had been dropt, but nothing serious.
<p/>But it would not do; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had not come to the point. '' Cautious, very cautious,'' thought Emma; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) advances inch by inch, and will hazard nothing till he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) believes himself secure.
<p/>Still, however, though every thing had not been accomplished by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ingenious device, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not but flatter herself that it had been the occasion of much present enjoyment to both, and must be leading them forward to the great event.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XI Mr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma's power to superintend his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) happiness or quicken his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) measures.
<p/>The coming of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sister's family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) prime object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not herself expect--that any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to the lovers.
<p/>They might advance rapidly if they would, however; they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hardly wished to have more leisure for them.
<p/>Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest.
<p/>Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella's sake; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) thought much of the evils of the journey for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), and not a little of the fatigues of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) alarms were needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent number of nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety.
<p/>The bustle and joy of such an arrival, the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed and disposed of, produced a noise and confusion which his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) nerves could not have borne under any other cause, nor have endured much longer even for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) little ones, and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance, all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing, which they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay, the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them.
<p/>Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle, quiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate; wrapt up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so tenderly attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) father and sister that, but for these higher ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible.
<p/>There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they will do for themselves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could never see a fault in any of them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) inherited also much of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) constitution; was delicate in her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own health, over-careful of that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) children, had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own Mr. Wingfield in town as her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) father could be of Mr. Perry.
<p/>Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man; rising in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) profession, domestic, and respectable in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) private character; but with reserved manners which prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) being generally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) temper was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) great perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased.
<p/>They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance. The extreme sweetness of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) temper must hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wanted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was not a great favourite with his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong in him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>sister-in-law</b></font>) was quick in feeling the little injuries to Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself.
<p/>Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) might have passed over more had his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) manners been flattering to Isabella's sister, but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without praise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) regardless of that greatest fault of all in her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) eyes which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sometimes fell into, the want of respectful forbearance towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) father.
<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not always the patience that could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed.
<p/>It did not often happen; for Mr. John Knightley had really a great regard for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) father-in-law, and generally a strong sense of what was due to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); but it was too often for Emma's charity, especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured, though the offence came not.
<p/>The beginning, however, of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality.
<p/>They had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter's attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had been there last.
<p/>'' Ah, my dear,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``poor Miss Taylor --It is a grievous business.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Oh yes, sir,'' cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) with ready sympathy, <div class="bookquote">``how you must miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>)!
<p/>And dear Emma, too!--What a dreadful loss to you both!--I have been so grieved for you.--I could not imagine how you could possibly do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>).--It
<p/>is a sad change indeed.--But I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) is pretty well, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pretty well, my dear--I hope--pretty well.--I do not know but that the place agrees with her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) tolerably.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of Randalls. '' Oh! no--none in the least.
<p/>I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my life--never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) own regret.'' <div class="bookquote">``Very much to the honour of both,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the handsome reply.
<p/>'' And do you see her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), sir, tolerably often?'' asked Isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) father. Mr. Woodhouse hesitated.--<div class="bookquote">``Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish.
<p/>Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one, have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both, either at Randalls or here--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married. and as you may suppose, Isabella, most frequently here.
<p/>They are very, very kind in their visits. Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way, you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all.
<p/>Every body must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated--which is the exact truth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy.
<p/>I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and now you have Emma's account
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just as it should be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. John Knightley, ``and just as I hoped it was from your letters. , I hope you will be satisfied.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse--<div class="bookquote">``yes, certainly--I cannot deny that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty often--but then--she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is always obliged to go away again.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not, papa.--You quite forget poor Mr. Weston.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>said John Knightley pleasantly, <div class="bookquote">``that Mr. Weston has some little claim.
<p/>I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force.
<p/>As for Isabella, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div><p/>You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of the poor husband. <div class="bookquote">``Me, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife hearing</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife, hearing and understanding only in part.--
<p/>about me?--I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for the misery of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you talking as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) does not deserve.
<p/>I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is one of the very best-tempered men that ever existed. Excepting yourself and your brother, I do not know his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) equal for temper.
<p/>I shall never forget his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) flying Henry's kite for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that very windy day last Easter--and ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night, on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence.--If any body can deserve him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), it must be Miss Taylor.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where is the young man?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>said John Knightley. '' Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) been here on this occasion--or has he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) not?'' ''
<p/>There was a strong expectation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in nothing; and I have not heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) mentioned lately.''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) has not been here yet,'' replied Emma. '' '' But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), and a very proper, handsome letter it was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) shewed it to me.
<p/>I thought it very well done of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) indeed. Whether it was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own idea you know, one cannot tell. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is but young, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) uncle, perhaps--
<p/>'' '' My dear papa, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes.'' <div class="bookquote">``Three-and-twenty!--is he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) indeed?--Well , I could not have thought it--and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was but two years old when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) poor mother!
<p/>Well, time does fly indeed!--and my memory is very bad. However, it was an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of pleasure.
<p/>I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept. 28th--and began, `My dear Madam,' but I forget how it went on; and it was signed
<p/>`F. C. Weston Churchill.'--I remember that perfectly. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How very pleasing and proper of him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. John Knightley/Mrs. Knightley</b></font>)</div>cried the good-hearted Mrs. John Knightley.
<p/>'' I have no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) being a most amiable young man. But how sad it is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should not live at home with his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) father!
<p/>There is something so shocking in a child's being taken away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) parents and natural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part with him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).
<p/>To give up one's child! I really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. John Knightley coolly. '' But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John.
<p/>Mr. Weston is rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings; he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) takes things as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society for his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection, or any thing that home affords.
<p/>Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, and had half a mind to take it up; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) struggled, and let it pass.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home to himself, whence resulted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) brother's disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it was important.--It had a high claim to forbearance.
<p/>CHAPTER XII Mr. Knightley was to dine with them--rather against the inclination of Mr. Woodhouse, who did not like that any one should share with him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) in Isabella's first day.
<p/>Emma's sense of right however had decided it; and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had particular pleasure, from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr. Knightley and herself, in procuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) the proper invitation.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hoped they might now become friends again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought it was time to make up. Making-up indeed would not do.
<p/>Concession must be out of the question; but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) came into the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had one of the children with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--the youngest, a nice little girl about eight months old, who was now making her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) first visit to Hartfield, and very happy to be danced about in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) aunt's arms.
<p/>It did assist; for though he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) began with grave looks and short questions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way, and to take the child out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity.
<p/>Emma felt they were friends again; and the conviction giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at first great satisfaction, and then a little sauciness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not help saying, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was admiring the baby, <div class="bookquote">``What a comfort it is, that we think alike about our nephews and nieces.
<p/>As to men and women, our opinions are sometimes very different; but with regard to these children, I observe we never disagree.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the baby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``If you were as much guided by nature in your estimate of men and women, and as little under the power of fancy and whim in your dealings with them, as you are where these children are concerned, we might always think alike.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) certainly had not been in the wrong, and he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) would never own that he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) had. '' To be sure--our discordancies must always arise from my being in the wrong.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A material difference then,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) replied--<div class="bookquote">``and no doubt you were much my superior in judgment at that period of our lives; but does not the lapse of one-and-twenty years bring our understandings a good deal nearer?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>), smiling--<div class="bookquote">``and reason good. I was sixteen years old when you were born.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Yes--a good deal nearer .''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have still the advantage of you by sixteen years' experience, and by not being a pretty young woman and a spoiled child.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>But still, not near enough to give me a chance of being right, if we think differently. '' Come, my dear Emma, let us be friends, and say no more about it.
<p/>Tell your aunt, little Emma, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances, and that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) were not wrong before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is now.
<p/>'' '' That's true,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried--<div class="bookquote">``very true. Little Emma, grow up a better woman than your aunt. Be infinitely cleverer and not half so conceited.
<p/>As far as good intentions went, we were both right, and I must say that no effects on my side of the argument have yet proved wrong.
<p/>Now, Mr. Knightley, a word or two more, and I have done. I only want to know that Mr. Martin is not very, very bitterly disappointed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' A man cannot be more so,'' was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) short, full answer. '' Ah!--Indeed I am very sorry.--Come, shake hands with me.
<p/>'' This had just taken place and with great cordiality, when John Knightley made his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) appearance, and <div class="bookquote">``How d'ye do, George?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>succeeded in the true English style, burying under a calmness that seemed all but indifference, the real attachment which would have led either of them, if requisite, to do every thing for the good of the other.
<p/>The evening was quiet and conversable, as Mr. Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) dear Isabella, and the little party made two natural divisions; on one side he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter; on the other the two Mr. Knightleys; their subjects totally distinct, or very rarely mixing--and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other.
<p/>The brothers talked of their own concerns and pursuits, but principally of those of the elder, whose temper was by much the most communicative, and who was always the greater talker.
<p/>As a magistrate, he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) had generally some point of law to consult John about, or, at least, some curious anecdote to give; and as a farmer, as keeping in hand the home-farm at Donwell, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had to tell what every field was to bear next year, and to give all such local information as could not fail of being interesting to a brother whose home it had equally been the longest part of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) life, and whose attachments were strong.
<p/>The plan of a drain, the change of a fence, the felling of a tree, and the destination of every acre for wheat, turnips, or spring corn, was entered into with as much equality of interest by John, as his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) cooler manners rendered possible; and if his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) willing brother ever left him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) any thing to inquire about, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) inquiries even approached a tone of eagerness.
<p/>While they were thus comfortably occupied, Mr. Woodhouse was enjoying a full flow of happy regrets and fearful affection with his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter.
<p/>My poor dear Isabella,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), fondly taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) hand, and interrupting, for a few moments, her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) busy labours for some one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) five children--<div class="bookquote">``How long it is, how terribly long since you were here!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``John, how are you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div>And how tired you must be after your journey! You must go to bed early, my dear--and I recommend a little gruel to you before you go.--You
<p/>and I will have a nice basin of gruel together. My dear Emma, suppose we all have a little gruel. ''
<p/>Emma could not suppose any such thing, knowing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did, that both the Mr. Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself;--and two basins only were ordered.
<p/>After a little more discourse in praise of gruel, with some wondering at its not being taken every evening by every body, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightleys</b></font>) proceeded to say, with an air of grave reflection, <div class="bookquote">``It was an awkward business, my dear, your spending the autumn at South End instead of coming here.
<p/>I never had much opinion of the sea air.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Mr. Wingfield most strenuously recommended it, sir--or we should not have gone.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! my dear, but Perry had many doubts about the sea doing her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) any good; and as to myself, I have been long perfectly convinced, though perhaps I never told you so before, that the sea is very rarely of use to any body.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) recommended it for all the children, but particularly for the weakness in little Bella's throat,--both sea air and bathing.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am sure it almost killed me once.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, feeling this to be an unsafe subject, <div class="bookquote">``I must beg you not to talk of the sea.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>It makes me envious and miserable;--I who have never seen it! South End is prohibited, if you please. My dear Isabella, I have not heard you make one inquiry about Mr. Perry yet; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) never forgets you.''
<p/>Poor Perry is bilious, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) has not time to take care of himself--he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) tells me he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) has not time to take care of himself--which is very sad--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) is always wanted all round the country.
<p/>'' Oh! good Mr. Perry--how is he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>), sir?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, pretty well; but not quite well. I suppose there is not a man in such practice anywhere.
<p/>But then there is not so clever a man any where.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Perry</b></font>)</div>``And Mrs. Perry and the children, how are they? do the children grow?
<p/>I have a great regard for Mr. Perry. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) will be calling soon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) will be so pleased to see my little ones.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) will be here to-morrow, for I have a question or two to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) about myself of some consequence.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And, my dear, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) comes, you had better let him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) look at little Bella's throat. '' '' Oh! my dear sir, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) throat is so much better that I have hardly any uneasiness about it.
<p/>Either bathing has been of the greatest service to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>), or else it is to be attributed to an excellent embrocation of Mr. Wingfield's, which we have been applying at times ever since August.''
<p/>``It is not very likely, my dear, that bathing should have been of use to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>)--and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation, I would have spoken to--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs. and Miss Bates,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``I have not heard one inquiry after them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh! the good Bateses --I am quite ashamed of myself--but you mention them in most of your letters. I hope they are quite well.
<p/>Good old Mrs. Bates--I will call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) to-morrow, and take my children.--They are always so pleased to see my children.--And that excellent Miss Bates!--such thorough worthy people!--How are they, sir?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, pretty well, my dear, upon the whole. But poor Mrs. Bates had a bad cold about a month ago. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wingfield/Wingfield</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Wingfield told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wingfield</b></font>) has never known them more general or heavy--except when it has been quite an influenza.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How sorry I am! But colds were never so prevalent as they have been this autumn. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That has been a good deal the case, my dear; but not to the degree you mention.
<p/>Perry says that colds have been very general, but not so heavy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) has very often known them in November.
<p/>Perry does not call it altogether a sickly season.'' '' No, I do not know that Mr. Wingfield considers it very sickly except--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! my poor dear child, the truth is, that in London it is always a sickly season. Nobody is healthy in London, nobody can be.
<p/>It is a dreadful thing to have you forced to live there! so far off!--and the air so bad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wingfield/Wingfield</b></font>)</div>'' No, indeed-- we are not at all in a bad air.
<p/>Our part of London is very superior to most others!--You must not confound us with London in general, my dear sir.
<p/>I should be unwilling, I own, to live in any other part of the town;--there is hardly any other that I could be satisfied to have my children in: but we are so remarkably airy!--Mr.
<p/>The neighbourhood of Brunswick Square is very different from almost all the rest. We are so very airy! Wingfield thinks the vicinity of Brunswick Square decidedly the most favourable as to air.
<p/>You make the best of it--but after you have been a week at Hartfield, you are all of you different creatures; you do not look like the same.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! my dear, it is not like Hartfield. Now I cannot say, that I think you are any of you looking well at present.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry to hear you say so, sir; but I assure you, excepting those little nervous head-aches and palpitations which I am never entirely free from anywhere, I am quite well myself; and if the children were rather pale before they went to bed, it was only because they were a little more tired than usual, from their journey and the happiness of coming.
<p/>I hope you will think better of their looks to-morrow; for I assure you Mr. Wingfield told me, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wingfield</b></font>) did not believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Wingfield</b></font>) had ever sent us off altogether, in such good case.
<p/>I trust, at least, that you do not think Mr. Knightley looking ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>turning her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eyes with affectionate anxiety towards her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) husband.
<p/>'' Middling, my dear; I cannot compliment you. I think Mr. John Knightley very far from looking well. '' '' What is the matter, sir?--Did you speak to me?'' cried Mr. John Knightley, hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own name.
<p/>I am sorry to find, my love, that my father does not think you looking well--but I hope it is only from being a little fatigued.
<p/>'' I could have wished, however, as you know, that you had seen Mr. Wingfield before you left home.'' '' My dear Isabella,''--exclaimed he (<font color='blue'><b>Wingfield</b></font>) hastily--``pray do not concern yourself about my looks.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, <div class="bookquote">``about your friend Mr. Graham's intending to have a bailiff from Scotland, to look after his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) new estate.
<p/>Be satisfied with doctoring and coddling yourself and the children, and let me look as I chuse. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>What will it answer?
<p/>so long and successfully that, when forced to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attention again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father and sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had nothing worse to hear than Isabella's kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax; and Jane Fairfax, though no great favourite with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) in general, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was at that moment very happy to assist in praising.
<p/>Will not the old prejudice be too strong? '' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) talked in this way '' That sweet, amiable Jane Fairfax!
<p/>'' said Mrs. John Knightley.--``It is so long since I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), except now and then for a moment accidentally in town!
<p/>I always regret excessively on dear Emma's account that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cannot be more at Highbury; but now their daughter is married, I suppose Colonel and Mrs. Campbell will not be able to part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) at all.
<p/>What happiness it must be to her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) good old grandmother and excellent aunt, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) comes to visit them! She (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) would be such a delightful companion for Emma.
<p/>Mr. Woodhouse agreed to it all, but added, ``Our little friend Harriet Smith, however, is just such another pretty kind of young person.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am most happy to hear it--but only Jane Fairfax one knows to be so very accomplished and superior!--and exactly Emma's age.
<p/>This topic was discussed very happily, and others succeeded of similar moment, and passed away with similar harmony; but the evening did not close without a little return of agitation.
<p/>The gruel came and supplied a great deal to be said--much praise and many comments--undoubting decision of its wholesomeness for every constitution, and pretty severe Philippics upon the many houses where it was never met with tolerably;--but, unfortunately, among the failures which the daughter had to instance, the most recent, and therefore most prominent, was in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own cook at South End, a young woman hired for the time, who never had been able to understand what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) meant by a basin of nice smooth gruel, thin, but not too thin.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>You will like Harriet. Emma could not have a better companion than Harriet. '' '' Often as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had wished for and ordered it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had never been able to get any thing tolerable.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) head and fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with tender concern.--The ejaculation in Emma's ear expressed, ``Ah!
<p/>Here was a dangerous opening. there is no end of the sad consequences of your going to South End. It does not bear talking of.
<p/>And for a little while she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would not talk of it, and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to the relish of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own smooth gruel.
<p/>After an interval of some minutes, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) began with, <div class="bookquote">``I shall always be very sorry that you went to the sea this autumn, instead of coming here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' But why should you be sorry, sir?--I assure you, it did the children a great deal of good.'' ''
<p/>And, moreover, if you must go to the sea, it had better not have been to South End. South End is an unhealthy place.
<p/>Perry was surprized to hear you had fixed upon South End.'' <div class="bookquote">``I know there is such an idea with many people, but indeed it is quite a mistake,
<p/>sir.--We all had our health perfectly well there, never found the least inconvenience from the mud; and Mr. Wingfield says it is entirely a mistake to suppose the place unhealthy; and I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Wingfield</b></font>) may be depended on, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Wingfield</b></font>) thoroughly understands the nature of the air, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wingfield</b></font>) own brother and family have been there repeatedly.
<p/>if you went anywhere.--Perry was a week at Cromer once, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) holds it to be the best of all the sea-bathing places.
<p/>And, by what I understand, you might have had lodgings there quite away from the sea--a quarter of a mile off--very comfortable.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You should have gone to Cromer, my dear, A fine open sea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) says, and very pure air. You should have consulted Perry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But, my dear sir, the difference of the journey;--only consider how great it would have been.--An hundred miles, perhaps, instead of forty.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! my dear, as Perry says, where health is at stake, nothing else should be considered; and if one is to travel, there is not much to chuse between forty miles and
<p/>an hundred.--Better not move at all, better stay in London altogether than travel forty miles to get into a worse air.
<p/>Emma's attempts to stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father had been vain; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had reached such a point as this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not wonder at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) brother-in-law's breaking out.
<p/>Mr. Perry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>), in a voice of very strong displeasure, ``would do as well to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) opinion till it is asked for.
<p/>Why does he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) make it any business of his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>), to wonder at what I do?--at my taking my family to one part of the coast or another?--I may be allowed, I hope, the use of my judgment as well as Mr. Perry.--I want his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) directions no more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) drugs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) paused--and growing cooler in a moment, added, with only sarcastic dryness, <div class="bookquote">``If Mr. Perry can tell me how to convey a wife and five children a distance of an hundred and thirty miles with no greater expense or inconvenience than a distance of forty, I should be as willing to prefer Cromer to South End as he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) could himself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>'' This is just what Perry said. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) a very ill-judged measure. '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``True, true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Knightley, with most ready interposition--<div class="bookquote">``very true.
<p/>John, as to what I was telling you of my idea of moving the path to Langham, of turning it more to the right that it may not cut through the home meadows, I cannot conceive any difficulty.
<p/>I should not attempt it, if it were to be the means of inconvenience to the Highbury people, but if you call to mind exactly the present line of the path....
<p/>I shall see you at the Abbey to-morrow morning I hope, and then we will look them over, and you shall give me your opinion.
<p/>Mr. Woodhouse was rather agitated by such harsh reflections on his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) friend Perry, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had, in fact, though unconsciously, been attributing many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) own feelings and expressions;--but the soothing attentions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) daughters gradually removed the present evil, and the immediate alertness of one brother, and better recollections of the other, prevented any renewal of it.
<p/>That's a consideration indeed.--But The only way of proving it, however, will be to turn to our maps. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XIII
<p/>There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John Knightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning among her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) old acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) five children, and talking over what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had done every evening with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father and sister.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had nothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly. It was a delightful visit;--perfect, in being much too short.
<p/>In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too, there was no avoiding, though at Christmas.
<p/>Mr. Weston would take no denial; they must all dine at Randalls one day;--even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party.
<p/>How they were all to be conveyed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would have made a difficulty if he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could, but as his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) son and daughter's carriage and horses were actually at Hartfield, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was not able to make more than a simple question on that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) that they might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet also.
<p/>Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, were the only persons invited to meet them;--the hours were to be early, as well as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse's habits and inclination being consulted in every thing.
<p/>The evening before this great event -LRB-for it was a very great event that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December-RRB- had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had gone home so much indisposed with a cold, that, but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs. Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to leave the house.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was very feverish and had a bad sore throat: Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of, and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) from this delightful engagement, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) loss without many tears.
<p/>Emma sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could, to attend her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in Mrs. Goddard's unavoidable absences, and raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) spirits by representing how much Mr. Elton's would be depressed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) state; and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) at last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) having a most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) very much.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) was met by Mr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid--of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), on the rumour of considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) might carry some report of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) to Hartfield--they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) two eldest boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for.
<p/>Emma called on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the next day, and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) doom already signed with regard to Randalls. They joined company and proceeded together.
<p/>Emma was just describing the nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend's complaint;--<div class="bookquote">``a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), a quick, low pulse, &c.
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with them.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) exclaimed, ``A sore-throat!--I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid infectious sort.
<p/>Has Perry seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)? Indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks.
<p/>Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experience and care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) could not wish to reason away, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) would rather feed and assist than not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) added soon afterwards--as if quite another subject, <div class="bookquote">``It is so cold, so very cold--and looks and feels so very much like snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I should really try not to go out to-day--and dissuade my father from venturing; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has made up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind, and does not seem to feel the cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston.
<p/>Why does not Perry see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But, upon my word, Mr. Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself.
<p/>You appear to me a little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night.
<p/>Mr. Elton looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) did not very well know what answer to make; which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had not really the least inclination to give up the visit;--but Emma, too eager and busy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own previous conceptions and views to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) impartially, or see him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) with clear vision, was very well satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) muttering acknowledgment of its being <div class="bookquote">``very cold, certainly very cold,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) from Randalls, and secured him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening.
<p/>But hardly had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) so spoken, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) brother was civilly offering a seat in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's only objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction.
<p/>It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment; never had his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) smile been stronger, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) eyes more exulting than when he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) next looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).
<p/>Well,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to herself, <div class="bookquote">``this is most strange!--After I had got him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill behind!--Most strange
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' You do quite right,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>);--<div class="bookquote">``we will make your apologies to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' indeed!--But there is
<p/>, I believe, in many men, especially single men, such an inclination--such a passion for dining out--a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures, their employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any thing gives way to it--and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most valuable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in love with Harriet; but still, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot refuse an invitation, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must dine out wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is asked.
<p/>What a strange thing love is! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can see ready wit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). ''
<p/>Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not but do him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) voice while assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) should call at Mrs. Goddard's for news of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) fair friend, the last thing before he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) prepared for the happiness of meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) again, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) hoped to be able to give a better report; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) favour.
<p/>After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley began with-- <div class="bookquote">``I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr. Elton.
<p/>It is downright labour to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) where ladies are concerned. With men he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) can be rational and unaffected, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has ladies to please, every feature works.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect,'' replied Emma; <div class="bookquote">``but where there is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a great deal.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>Where a man does his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best with only moderate powers, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such perfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but value.
<p/>'' '' Yes,'' said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div><p/>Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied with a smile of astonishment, <div class="bookquote">``are you imagining me to be Mr. Elton's object?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Elton in love with me!--What an idea!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly.
<p/>I think your manners to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better look about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Elton and I are very good friends, and nothing more;'' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked on, amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very well pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) brother for imagining her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) blind and ignorant, and in want of counsel.
<p/>Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) mind to the visit, that in spite of the increasing coldness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) eldest daughter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own carriage, with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it.
<p/>The cold, however, was severe; and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes of snow were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) said no more. Emma soon saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) companion was not in the happiest humour.
<p/>The preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least, which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means
<p/>like; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) in expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) discontent.
<p/>A man,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), ``must have a very good opinion of himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) asks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as this, for the sake of coming to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).
<p/>It is the greatest absurdity--Actually snowing at this moment!--The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home--and the folly of people's not staying comfortably at home when they can!
<p/>If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we should deem it;--and here
<p/>are we, probably with rather thinner clothing than usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of the voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) view or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can;--here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow.
<p/>Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse;--four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home.
<p/>Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the <div class="bookquote">``Very true, my love,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which must have been usually administered by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) travelling companion; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must think himself a most agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not be complying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dreaded being quarrelsome; her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heroism reached only to silence.
<p/>They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr. Elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to talk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lips. Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject.
<p/>Mr. Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was so very cheerful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) civilities indeed, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) must have received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had sent while dressing, and the answer had been, <div class="bookquote">``Much the same--not better.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>'' My report from Mrs. Goddard's,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) presently, ``was not so pleasant as I had hoped--`Not better' was my answer.
<p/>no--I am grieved to find--I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better, by no means better, rather worse.
<p/>Very much grieved and concerned--I had flattered myself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must be better after such a cordial as I knew had been given her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) in the morning.
<p/>Emma smiled and answered--<div class="bookquote">``My visit was of use to the nervous part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat; it is a most severe cold indeed.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face lengthened immediately; and his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) voice was the voice of sentiment as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) answered. '' Oh! '' Mr. Perry has been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), as you probably heard.''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) has been used to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report.
<p/>'' Yes--I imagined--that is--I did not--'' '' But it is impossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party to-day!''
<p/>'' Dreadful!--Exactly so, indeed.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) will be missed every moment. '' This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable; but it should have lasted longer.
<p/>Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began to speak of other things, and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.
<p/>'' What an excellent device,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``the use of a sheepskin for carriages. How very comfortable they make it;--impossible to feel cold with such precautions.
<p/>The contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced and guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted.
<p/>Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very cold afternoon--but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter.--Ha!
<p/>snows a little I see. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Yes,'' said John Knightley, <div class="bookquote">``and I think we shall have a good deal of it.
<p/>Quite seasonable; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday, and prevent this day's party, which it might very possibly have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Christmas weather,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Elton. '' This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body invites their friends about them, and people think little of even the worst weather.
<p/>I was snowed up at a friend's house once for a week. Nothing could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not get away till that very day se`nnight.
<p/>Mr. John Knightley looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) did not comprehend the pleasure, but said only, coolly, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls.
<p/>At another time Emma might have been amused, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was too much astonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party. '' We are sure of excellent fires,'' continued he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and every thing in the greatest comfort.
<p/>Weston indeed is much beyond praise, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is exactly what one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society;--it will be a small party, but where small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any.
<p/>Mr. Weston's dining-room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably; and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by two than exceed by two.
<p/>I think I shall certainly have your approbation, though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties of London, may not quite enter into our feelings.
<p/>Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston;--Mrs. I think you will agree with me, -LRB-turning with a soft air to Emma,-RRB- ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir--I never dine with any body.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! -LRB-in a tone of wonder and pity,-RRB- I had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery.
<p/>Well, sir, the time must come when you will be paid for all this, when you will have little labour and great enjoyment.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My first enjoyment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>replied John Knightley, as they passed through the sweep-gate, <div class="bookquote">``will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XIV Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room;--Mr. Elton must compose his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) ill-humour.
<p/>Mr. Elton must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for the place.--Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as happy as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was.
<p/>Mr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the world to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) spoke with such unreserve, as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife; not any one, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) related with such conviction of being listened to and understood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the little affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father and herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston had not a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.
<p/>This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might not afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but the very sight of Mrs. Weston, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) smile, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) touch, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) voice was grateful to Emma, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) determined to think as little as possible of Mr. Elton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost.
<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons. The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through before her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) arrival.
<p/>Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it, besides all the history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own and Isabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed just got to the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) satisfaction that James should come and see his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been almost wholly engrossed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) attentions to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), was able to turn away and welcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) dear Emma.
<p/>Emma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) rather sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/>The difficulty was great of driving his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) strange insensibility towards Harriet, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mind, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) not only sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) elbow, but was continually obtruding his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) happy countenance on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) notice, and solicitously addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) upon every occasion.
<p/>Instead of forgetting him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) behaviour was such that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not avoid the internal suggestion of <div class="bookquote">``Can it really be as my brother imagined?
<p/>can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affections from Harriet to me?--Absurd and insufferable!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be so anxious for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father, and so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) good manners.
<p/>For her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own sake she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could not be rude; and for Harriet's, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was even positively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton's nonsense, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) particularly wished to listen to.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) heard enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) heard the words <div class="bookquote">``my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Frank,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>repeated several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much suspected that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was announcing an early visit from his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) son; but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would have been awkward.
<p/>Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never marrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill, which always interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had frequently thought--especially since his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's marriage with Miss Taylor--that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) were to marry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was the very person to suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) in age, character and condition.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) seemed by this connexion between the families, quite to belong to her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of.
<p/>That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was very strongly persuaded; and though not meaning to be induced by him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), or by any body else, to give up a situation which she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) believed more replete with good than any she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could change it for, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had a great curiosity to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), a decided intention of finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) pleasant, of being liked by him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to a certain degree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends' imaginations.
<p/>With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very cross--and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again, or the substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston.--So it proved;--for when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston, at dinner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``We want only two more to be just the right number.
<p/>I should like to see two more here,--your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my son--and then I should say we were quite complete.
<p/>I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting Frank. I had a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) this morning, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) will be with us within a fortnight.
<p/>Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party quite complete.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) has been wanting to come to us,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Weston, <div class="bookquote">``ever since September: every letter has been full of it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) cannot command his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) has those to please who must be pleased, and who -LRB-between ourselves-RRB- are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>'' But now I have no doubt of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) here about the second week in January. '' '' What a very great pleasure it will be to you!
<p/>and Mrs. Weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must be almost as happy as yourself.'' ``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would be, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) thinks there will be another put-off.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) does not depend upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) coming so much as I do: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) does not know the parties so well as I do.
<p/>The case, you see, is---LRB-but this is quite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room.
<p/>There are secrets in all families, you know-RRB---The case is, that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January; and that Frank's coming depends upon their being put off.
<p/>But I know they will, because it is a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years, they always are put off when it comes to the point.
<p/>I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of being here myself: but your good friend there -LRB-nodding towards the upper end of the table-RRB- has so few vagaries herself, and has been so little used to them at Hartfield, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cannot calculate on their effects, as I have been long in the practice of doing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Emma; <div class="bookquote">``but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston.
<p/>If they are not put off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) cannot stir. I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>If you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe.
<p/>Yes--I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been at the place in my life.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is an odd woman!--But
<p/>I never allow myself to speak ill of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), on Frank's account; for I do believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>).
<p/>I used to think she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not capable of being fond of any body, except herself: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) has always been kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) -LRB-in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) way--allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing to be as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) likes-RRB-.
<p/>And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say it to any body else, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) has no more heart than a stone to people in general; and the devil of a temper.
<p/>Emma liked the subject so well, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began upon it, to Mrs. Weston, very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) joy--yet observing, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.-- Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of: <div class="bookquote">``for I cannot depend upon his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) coming.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' '' I cannot be so sanguine as Mr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing.
<p/>Yes--it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs. Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world.''
<p/>Mr. Weston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter stands?'' '' '' My Emma!'' replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, ``what is the certainty of caprice?
<p/>Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attending before--<div class="bookquote">``You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father thinks.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/-- Isabella</b></font>)</div>It depends entirely upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) aunt's spirits and pleasure; in short, upon her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) temper. To you--to my two daughters--I may venture on the truth.
<p/>Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered woman; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) coming now, depends upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) being willing to spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>).''
<p/>Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,'' replied Isabella: <div class="bookquote">``and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella/-- Isabella</b></font>)</div>To be constantly living with an ill-tempered person, must be dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any thing of; but it must be a life of misery.
<p/>What a blessing, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) never had any children! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) would have made them!'' Emma wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been alone with Mrs. Weston.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should then have heard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), with a degree of unreserve which she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would not hazard with Isabella; and, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) really believed, would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), excepting those views on the young man, of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) own imagination had already given her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) such instinctive knowledge.
<p/>But at present there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after dinner, was a confinement that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could not endure.
<p/>Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>); and gladly did he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) move to those with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was always comfortable.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of saying, <div class="bookquote">``And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain.
<p/>I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant, whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Even if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us.
<p/>I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) side; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills' to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to themselves.
<p/>'' Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. There is jealousy. They are jealous even of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) regard for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father.
<p/>In short, I can feel no dependence on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) ought to come,'' said Emma.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could stay only a couple of days, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's not having it in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power to do as much as that.
<p/>A young woman , if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fall into bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young man 's being under such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes it.''
<p/>One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before one decides upon what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can do,'' replied Mrs. Weston.
<p/>One ought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must not be judged by general rules: she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is so very unreasonable; and every thing gives way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).''
<p/>Now, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural, that while she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) owes every thing, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) exercises incessant caprice towards him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) , she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) owes nothing at all.''
<p/>My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand a bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way.
<p/>I have no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) having, at times, considerable influence; but it may be perfectly impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) to know beforehand when it will be.
<p/>'' '' '' '' But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is so fond of the nephew: he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) is so very great a favourite. '' ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) may have a great deal of influence on some points,'' continued Mrs. Weston, <div class="bookquote">``and on others, very little: and among those, on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance of his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) coming away from them to visit us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XV Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) tea; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) tea he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) three companions could do, to entertain away his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) notice of the lateness of the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared.
<p/>Mr. Weston was chatty and convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation.
<p/>Emma listened, and then coolly said, <div class="bookquote">``I shall not be satisfied, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) comes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' Mr. Elton, in very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in.
<p/>Mrs. Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) joined them immediately, and, with scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.
<p/>Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind by the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) late improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) as before, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) making Harriet his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) very first subject, was ready to listen with most friendly smiles.
<p/>Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) know?--had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) heard any thing about her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), since their being at Randalls?--he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) felt much anxiety--he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) must confess that the nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) complaint alarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) considerably.
<p/>And in this style he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) talked on for some time very properly, not much attending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charity with him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>).
<p/>But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) account, than on Harriet's--more anxious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should escape the infection, than that there should be no infection in the complaint.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) began with great earnestness to entreat her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber again, for the present--to entreat her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to promise him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) not to venture into such hazard till he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) opinion; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course, there was no putting an end to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) extreme solicitude about her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).
<p/>It did appear--there was no concealing it--exactly like the pretence of being in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), instead of Harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) professed himself extremely anxious about her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) fair friend--her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) fair, lovely, amiable friend. '' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was vexed. and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had difficulty in behaving with temper.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) turned to Mrs. Weston to implore her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) assistance, <div class="bookquote">``Would not she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) give him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) support?--would not she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) add her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) persuasions to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard's till it were certain that Miss Smith's disorder had no infection?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could not be satisfied without a promise--would not she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) give him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) influence in procuring it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So scrupulous for others,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``and yet so careless for herself!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself.
<p/>Is this fair, Mrs. Weston?--Judge between us. Have not I some right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid.
<p/>Emma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and as for herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could only give him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) a look; but it was such a look as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought must restore him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) senses, and then left the sofa, removing to a seat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sister, and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attention.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did another subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing fast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse:
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, sir. Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow.
<p/>Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else had something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized, and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer.
<p/>Mrs. Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) and turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) attention from his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) son-in-law, who was pursuing his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) triumph rather unfeelingly.
<p/>I admired your resolution very much, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``in venturing out in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Every body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired your spirit; and I dare say we shall get home very well.
<p/>Another hour or two's snow can hardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand.
<p/>Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) hurrying away.
<p/>As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was afraid they would find no difficulty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) wished the road might be impassable, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost good-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body, calling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) wife to agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), that with a little contrivance, every body might be lodged, which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hardly knew how to do, from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.
<p/>What is to be done, my dear Emma?--what is to be done?'' was Mr. Woodhouse's first exclamation, and all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could say for some time.
<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) looked for comfort; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) assurances of safety, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) representation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of their having so many friends about them, revived him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) a little.
<p/>I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight. '' '' His (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) own.
<p/>The horror of being blocked up at Randalls, while her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) children were at Hartfield, was full in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was eager to have it settled, that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father and Emma should remain at Randalls, while she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.
<p/>You had better order the carriage directly, my love,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I dare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if we do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk.
<p/>I could change my shoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing does give you cold.
<p/>'' I am not at all afraid. I should not mind walking half the way. <div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). '' Walk home!--you are prettily shod for walking home, I dare say.
<p/>It will be bad enough for the horses. '' Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) approbation of the plan. Mrs. Weston could only approve.
<p/>Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away; and they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had left the room immediately after his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) brother's first report of the snow, came back again, and told them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had been out of doors to examine, and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour hence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had gone beyond the sweep--some way along the Highbury road--the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep--in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present, but the clouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its being soon over.
<p/>To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's account, who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) nervous constitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) continued at Randalls.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home, but no assurances could convince him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that it was safe to stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending, Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences:
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) in there being nothing to apprehend. thus-- '' Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am ready, if the others are.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Shall I ring the bell?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, do. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for.
<p/>A few minutes more, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) own house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over.
<p/>The carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on such occasions, was carefully attended to his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own by Mr. Knightley and Mr. Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen, and the discovery of a much darker night than he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been prepared for.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was afraid they should have a very bad drive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was afraid poor Isabella would not like it. And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind.
<p/>They must keep as much together as they could;'' and James was talked to, and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage.
<p/>Isabella stept in after her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) father; John Knightley, forgetting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) did not belong to their party, stept in after his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wife very naturally; so that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them, and that they were to have a tete-a-tete drive.
<p/>It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure, previous to the suspicions of this very day; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could have talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but one.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had been drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine, and felt sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would want to be talking nonsense.
<p/>To restrain him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) as much as might be, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own manners, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night; but scarcely had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) begun, scarcely had they passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) subject cut up--her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand seized--her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attention demanded, and Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>): availing himself of the precious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well known, hoping--fearing--adoring--ready to die if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>); but flattering himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short, very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) did not know what they had best do. But now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would rather it had not happened. It really was so.
<p/>Without scruple--without apology--without much apparent diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) lover. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) tried to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>); but vainly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would go on, and say it all.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) felt that half this folly must be drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour.
<p/>Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the playful, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hoped would best suit his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) half and half state, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton.
<p/>Angry as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was, the thought of the moment made her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) resolve to restrain herself when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did speak. This to me !
<p/>you forget yourself--you take me for my friend--any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver; but no more of this to me , if you please.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>could she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) possibly mean!''--And he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) words with such assurance of accent, such boastful pretence of amazement, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could not help replying with quickness, ``Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct!
<p/>and I can account for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Smith!--message to Miss Smith!--What Command yourself enough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) spirits, not at all to confuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) intellects.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) perfectly knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own meaning; and having warmly protested against her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) suspicion as most injurious, and slightly touched upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) respect for Miss Smith as her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) friend,--but acknowledging his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) resumed the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own passion, and was very urgent for a favourable answer.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) thought less of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) inebriety, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) thought more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) inconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness, replied, <div class="bookquote">``It is impossible for me to doubt any longer.
<p/>After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last month, to Miss Smith--such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing--to be addressing me in this manner--this is an unsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible!
<p/>You have made yourself too clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express. Believe me, sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object of such professions.
<p/>Smith!--I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence--never paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) any attentions, but as your friend: never cared whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) were dead or alive, but as your friend.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's sanguine state of mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) tried to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand again, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) joyously exclaimed-- <div class="bookquote">``Charming Miss Woodhouse!

<p/>In no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake ends where it does.
<p/>Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware, probably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of.
<p/>But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I trust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of matrimony at present.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was too angry to say another word; her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) manner too decided to invite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually deep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer, for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace.
<p/>If there had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment.
<p/>Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves, all at once, at the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) house; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was out before another syllable passed.--Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) a good night.
<p/>'' The compliment was just returned, coldly and proudly; and, under indescribable irritation of spirits, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was then conveyed to Hartfield.
<p/>There she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father, who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane--turning a corner which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could never bear to think of--and in strange hands--a mere common coachman--no James; and there it seemed as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr. John Knightley, ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) ill-humour, was now all kindness and attention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father, as to seem--if not quite ready to join him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in a basin of gruel--perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party, except herself.--But her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) mind had never been in such perturbation; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) the relief of quiet reflection.
<p/>The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think and be miserable.--It was a wretched business indeed!--Such
<p/>CHAPTER XVI an overthrow of every thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been wishing for!--Such a development of every thing most unwelcome!--Such a blow for Harriet!--that was the worst of all.
<p/>Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or other; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken--more in error--more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) actually was,
<p/>could the effects of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) blunders have been confined to herself. '' If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have borne any thing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have doubled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) presumption to me--but poor Harriet! '' How she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could have been so deceived!--He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) protested that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never thought seriously of Harriet--never!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) looked back as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could; but it was all confusion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had taken up the idea, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) supposed, and made every thing bend to it.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manners, however, must have been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not have been so misled. The picture!--How eager he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been about the picture!--and the charade!--and
<p/>To be sure, the charade, with its <div class="bookquote">``ready wit'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--but then the <div class="bookquote">``soft eyes'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--in fact it suited neither; it was a jumble without taste or truth.
<p/>Certainly she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had often, especially of late, thought his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manners to herself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way, as a mere error of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not always lived in the best society, that with all the gentleness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but, till this very day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) as Harriet's friend.
<p/>To Mr. John Knightley was she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) indebted for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) first idea on the subject, for the first start of its possibility.
<p/>an hundred other circumstances;--how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet. Who could have seen through such thick-headed nonsense? There was no denying that those brothers had penetration.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) remembered what Mr. Knightley had once said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) about Mr. Elton, the caution he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had given, the conviction he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) character had been there shewn than any she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had reached herself.
<p/>It was dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in many respects, the very reverse of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had meant and believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>); proud, assuming, conceited; very full of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own claims, and little concerned about the feelings of others.
<p/>Contrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) addresses to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had sunk him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) opinion.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) professions and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) proposals did him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) no service. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thought nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) attachment, and was insulted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) hopes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wanted to marry well, and having the arrogance to raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) eyes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), pretended to be in love; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was perfectly easy as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for.
<p/>Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice, less allied with real love.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse of Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so easily obtained as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had fancied, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would soon try for Miss Somebody else with twenty, or with ten.
<p/>But--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) should talk of encouragement, should consider her (<font color='blue'><b>Somebody</b></font>) as aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) views, accepting his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) attentions, meaning -LRB-in short-RRB-, to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)!--should
<p/>suppose himself her (<font color='blue'><b>Somebody</b></font>) equal in connexion or mind!--look down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Somebody</b></font>) friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Somebody</b></font>)!--It was most provoking.
<p/>Perhaps it was not fair to expect him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to feel how very much he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Somebody</b></font>) inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind.
<p/>The very want of such equality might prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) perception of it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) must know that in fortune and consequence she (<font color='blue'><b>Somebody</b></font>) was greatly his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) superior.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family--and that the Eltons were nobody.
<p/>The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate, to which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from other sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) way as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to notice but his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) situation and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) civility.--But he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had fancied her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>); that evidently must have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) dependence; and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own behaviour to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had been so complaisant and obliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as -LRB-supposing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) real motive unperceived-RRB- might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had so misinterpreted his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had little right to wonder that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) , with self-interest to blind him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), should have mistaken hers.
<p/>There had been no real affection either in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) language or manners. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) need not trouble herself to pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). The first error and the worst lay at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) door.
<p/>It was adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what ought to be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple.
<p/>It was foolish, it was wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was quite concerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might never have thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) but for me; and certainly never would have thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) with hope, if I had not assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) attachment, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is as modest and humble as I used to think him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).
<p/>'' Here have I,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man. Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) not to accept young Martin.
<p/>There I was quite right. That was well done of me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and chance.
<p/>I was introducing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) into good company, and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to have attempted more.
<p/>I have been but half a friend to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) were not to feel this disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>);--William Coxe--Oh!
<p/>But now, poor girl, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) peace is cut up for some time. no, I could not endure William Coxe--a pert young lawyer.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stopt to blush and laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own relapse, and then resumed a more serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might be, and must be.
<p/>The distressing explanation she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had to make to Harriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the awkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in most unmirthful reflections some time longer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) having blundered most dreadfully.
<p/>To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma's, though under temporary gloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits.
<p/>The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy, and of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope.
<p/>Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had gone to bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and to depend on getting tolerably out of it.
<p/>It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)--that Harriet's nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive--and that there could be no necessity for any body's knowing what had passed except the three principals, and especially for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father's being given a moment's uneasiness about it.
<p/>These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) further service, for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present.
<p/>Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter attempted it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas.
<p/>The ground covered with snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, every morning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in to freeze, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was for many days a most honourable prisoner.
<p/>No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note; no church for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton's absenting himself.
<p/>It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hoped and believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to be really taking comfort in some society or other, it was very pleasant to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father so well satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) being all alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own house, too wise to stir out; and to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep entirely from them,--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The weather was most favourable for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>); though Christmas Day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not go to church. <div class="bookquote">``Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?''
 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>These days of confinement would have been, but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) private perplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) companions; and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ill-humour at Randalls, that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) amiableness never failed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) during the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) stay at Hartfield.
<p/>But with all the hopes of cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was still such an evil hanging over her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in the hour of explanation with Harriet, as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was always agreeable and obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body. CHAPTER XVII Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield.
<p/>The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and Mr. Woodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter to stay behind with all her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) children, was obliged to see the whole party set off, and return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) lamentations over the destiny of poor Isabella;--which poor Isabella, passing her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) life with those she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) doated on, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always innocently busy, might have been a model of right feminine happiness.
<p/>The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say, with Mr. Elton's best compliments, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was proposing to leave Highbury the following morning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) way to Bath; where, in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had engaged to spend a few weeks, and very much regretted the impossibility he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was under, from various circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse, of whose friendly civilities he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) should ever retain a grateful sense--and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be happy to attend to them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) for contriving it, though not able to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) much credit for the manner in which it was announced.
<p/>Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) father, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was so pointedly excluded.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>Emma was most agreeably surprized.--Mr. Elton's absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not even a share in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) opening compliments.--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) name was not mentioned;--and
<p/>so striking a change in all this, and such an ill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) graceful acknowledgments, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought, at first, could not escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's suspicion.
<p/>It did, however.--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely to the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) language.
<p/>It was a very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening.
<p/>there was Mr. Woodhouse talked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) alarms, and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) usual promptitude.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had reason to believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nearly recovered from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cold, and it was desirable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) other complaint before the gentleman's return.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went to Mrs. Goddard's accordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessary penance of communication; and a severe one it was.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had to destroy all the hopes which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been so industriously feeding--to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred--and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ideas on one subject, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) observations, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) convictions, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) prophecies for the last six weeks.
<p/>The confession completely renewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) first shame--and the sight of Harriet's tears made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) should never be in charity with herself again.
<p/>Harriet bore the intelligence very well--blaming nobody--and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend.
<p/>Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost; and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed on Harriet's side, not her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark. Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of.
<p/>The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) never could have deserved him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)--and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) tears fell abundantly--but her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) grief was so truly artless, that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma's eyes--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and tried to console her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart and understanding--really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two--and that to resemble her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would be more for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do.
<p/>It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and ignorant; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) life.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) second duty now, inferior only to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father's claims, was to promote Harriet's comfort, and endeavour to prove her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own affection in some better method than by match-making.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) got her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to Hartfield, and shewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) the most unvarying kindness, striving to occupy and amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), and by books and conversation, to drive Mr. Elton from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thoughts.
<p/>Time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general, and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton in particular; but it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) reasonable that at Harriet's age, and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton's return, as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance, without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them.
<p/>Harriet did think him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) all perfection, and maintained the non-existence of any body equal to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) in person or goodness--and did, in truth, prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen; but yet it appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so natural, so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort unrequited , that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force.
<p/>If Mr. Elton, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) return, made his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own indifference as evident and indubitable as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would anxiously do, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not imagine Harriet's persisting to place her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) happiness in the sight or the recollection of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).
<p/>Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible. Their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad for each, for all three.
<p/>Not one of them had the power of removal, or of effecting any material change of society. They must encounter each other, and make the best of it.
<p/>Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) companions at Mrs. Goddard's; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could have any chance of hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth.
<p/>Where the wound had been given, there must the cure be found if anywhere; and Emma felt that, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in the way of cure, there could be no true peace for herself.
<p/>CHAPTER XVIII Mr. Frank Churchill did not come. When the time proposed drew near, Mrs. Weston's fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse.
<p/>For the present, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not be spared, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``very great mortification and regret; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) looked forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period.
<p/>Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed--much more disappointed, in fact, than her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) husband, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for ever expecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression.
<p/>For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and sorry; but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) began to perceive that Frank's coming two or three months later would be a much better plan; better time of year; better weather; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would be able, without any doubt, to stay considerably longer with them than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had come sooner.
<p/>These feelings rapidly restored his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of a more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays; and after all her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) concern for what her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) husband was to suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It soon flies over the present failure, and begins to hope again. The acquaintance at present had no charm for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted, rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was desirable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) should appear, in general, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) usual self, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) took care to express as much interest in the circumstance, and enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston's disappointment, as might naturally belong to their friendship.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary, -LRB-or, being acting a part, perhaps rather more,-RRB- at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) away.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) then proceeded to say a good deal more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) felt, of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would have made; and ending with reflections on the Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement with Mr. Knightley; and, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) great amusement, perceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was taking the other side of the question from her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) real opinion, and making use of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself.
<p/>'' The Churchills are very likely in fault,'' said Mr. Knightley, coolly; <div class="bookquote">``but I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) might come if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) own heart, as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) deficiency--but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable,--a waste of time--tiresome women--and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) seldom went near them.
<p/>But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in--observing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) proposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could calculate, they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.
<p/>Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment, which was every thing to them, the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to give up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) place to Miss Woodhouse, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) more active, talking daughter, almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after Mr. Woodhouse's health, cheerful communications about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother's, and sweet-cake from the beaufet--<div class="bookquote">``Mrs.

<p/>Whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) kindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can.

<p/>All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath; and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss Fairfax's handwriting.

<p/>I am sure there is nobody's praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss Woodhouse's. My mother does not hear; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is a little deaf you know.
<p/>And Emma had the advantage of hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very rude, of making her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) escape from Jane Fairfax's letter, and had almost resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse, when Miss Bates turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) again and seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) attention.
<p/>Ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging to say about Jane's handwriting? ''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>'' My mother's deafness is very trifling you see--just nothing at all.
<p/>By only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is sure to hear; but then she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is used to my voice.
<p/>However, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will not find her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grandmama at all deafer than she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at my mother's time of life--and it really is full two years, you know, since she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was here.
<p/>We never were so long without seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) before, and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) now.''
<p/>But it is very remarkable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) should always hear Jane better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) does me. Jane speaks so distinct! <div class="bookquote">``Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh yes; next week. '' <div class="bookquote">``Indeed!--that must be a very great pleasure.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week.
<p/>I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) will be as happy to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) friends at Highbury, as they can be to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).
<p/>Yes, Friday or Saturday; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) cannot say which, because Colonel Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days.
<p/>Every body is so surprized; and every body says the same obliging things. So very good of them to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) the whole way!
<p/>That is the reason of her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) writing out of rule, as we call it; for, in the common course, we should not have heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) before next Tuesday or Wednesday.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But they always do, you know. Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next. That is what she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) writes about. '' Yes, so I imagined.
<p/>I was afraid there could be little chance of my hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day.'' '' So obliging of you!
<p/>No, we should not have heard, if it had not been for this particular circumstance, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) being to come here so soon.
<p/>My mother is so delighted!--for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is to be three months with us at least. Three months, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says so, positively, as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you.
<p/>The case is, you see, that the Campbells are going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) father and mother to come over and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) directly.
<p/>till she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) married, last October, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) was never away from them so much as a week, which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say, but however different countries, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) wrote a very urgent letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) mother--or her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) father,
<p/>I declare I do not know which it was, but we shall see presently in Jane's letter--wrote in Mr. Dixon's name as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own, to press their coming over directly, and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy.
<p/>Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean--I do not know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) ever heard about it from any body else; but it was very natural, you know, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) should like to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) own place while he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) was paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) addresses--and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them--for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter's not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all blame them
<p/>; of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) heard every thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) might be telling Miss Campbell about his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) own home in Ireland; and I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) wrote us word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) had taken himself.
<p/>They had not intended to go over till the summer, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) is so impatient to see them again--for He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) is a most amiable, charming young man, I believe.
<p/>At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma's brain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the not going to Ireland, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) said, with the insidious design of farther discovery, <div class="bookquote">``You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to come to you at such a time.
<p/>Considering the very particular friendship between her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) to be excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell.
<p/>The very thing that we have always been rather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) at such a distance from us, for months together--not able to come if any thing was to happen.
<p/>Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) account of things. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Very true, very true, indeed. But you see, every thing turns out for the best.
<p/>They want her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) -LRB-Mr. and Mrs. Dixon-RRB- excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint invitation, Jane says, as you will hear presently; Mr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention.
<p/>Ever since the service he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) rendered Jane at Weymouth, when they were out in that party on the water, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails, would have been dashed into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) had not, with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) habit--
<p/>-LRB-I can never think of it without trembling!-RRB---But ever since we had the history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!''
 (<font color='red'><b>all friends</b></font>)</div><p/>But, in spite of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) friends' urgency, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own wish of seeing Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs. Bates?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--entirely her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) own doing, entirely her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) own choice; and Colonel and Mrs. Campbell think she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) does quite right, just what they should recommend; and indeed they particularly wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) to try her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) native air, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) has not been quite so well as usual lately.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) is a most charming young man. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``I am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely.
<p/>Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has no remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be compared with Miss Fairfax.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dixon</b></font>)</div><p/>But Mrs. Dixon must be very much disappointed. '' Oh! no. You are very obliging to say such things--but certainly not.
<p/>There is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always was absolutely plain--but extremely elegant and amiable.'' '' Yes, that of course.''
<p/>so long ago as the 7th of November, -LRB-as I am going to read to you,-RRB- and has never been well since.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) never mentioned it before, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would not alarm us.
<p/>that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) kind friends the Campbells think she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had better come home, and try an air that always agrees with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>); and they have no doubt that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)--and it is certainly a great deal better that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) should come here, than go to Ireland, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is unwell.
<p/>Just like her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)! so considerate!--But however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is so far from well, Nobody could nurse her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), as we should do.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following--as you will find from Jane's letter.
<p/>If it was not for the drawback of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) illness--but I am afraid we must expect to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) grown thin, and looking very poorly.
<p/>'' So sudden!--You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse, what a flurry it has thrown me in! I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me, as to that.
<p/>I always make a point of reading Jane's letters through to myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>and so I began to-day with my usual caution; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) being unwell, than I burst out, quite frightened, with `Bless me!
<p/>Jane desired me to do it, so I always do: poor Jane is ill!'--which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed at.
<p/>However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I had fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) does not think much about it.
<p/>But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my guard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry.
<p/>The expense shall not be thought of; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) is so liberal, and so fond of Jane that I dare
<p/>say he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) would not mean to charge any thing for attendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know.
<p/>Well, now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) letter, and I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid we must be running away,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, glancing at Harriet, and beginning to rise--<div class="bookquote">``My father will be expecting us.
<p/>I had no intention, I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes, when I first entered the house.
<p/>I merely called, because I would not pass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates; but I have been so pleasantly detained!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has a wife and family to maintain, and is not to be giving away his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) time. Now, however, we must wish you and Mrs. Bates good morning.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) regained the street--happy in this, that though much had been forced on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) against her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) will, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had in fact heard the whole substance of Jane Fairfax's letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had been able to escape the letter itself.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet</b></font>)</div>And not all that could be urged to detain her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) succeeded. CHAPTER II Jane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates's youngest daughter.
<p/>Fairfax of the --regiment of infantry, and Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope and interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy remembrance of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) dying in action abroad--of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards--and this girl.
<p/>By birth she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old, on losing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) became the property, the charge, the consolation, the foundling of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grandmother and aunt, there had seemed every probability of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) being permanently fixed there; of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) being taught only what very limited means could command, and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what nature had given her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in a pleasing person, good understanding, and warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.
<p/>This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; and farther, had been indebted to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for such attentions, during a severe camp-fever, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed had saved his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life.
<p/>These were claims which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax, before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own return to England put any thing in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power.
<p/>The marriage of Lieut. But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) father gave a change to her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) destiny. When he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did return, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sought out the child and took notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a married man, with only one living child, a girl, about Jane's age: and Jane became their guest, paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all; and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was nine years old, his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) daughter's great fondness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) own wish of being a real friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) education.
<p/>It was accepted; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family, and had lived with them entirely, only visiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) grandmother from time to time.
<p/>The plan was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) should be brought up for educating others; the very few hundred pounds which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) inherited from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) father making independence impossible.
<p/>To provide for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell's power; for though his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) income, by pay and appointments, was handsome, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) fortune was moderate and must be all his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) daughter's; but, by giving her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) an education, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.
<p/>Such was Jane Fairfax's history. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had fallen into good hands, known nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent education.
<p/>Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed people, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell's residence being in London, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, by the attendance of first-rate masters.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children, fully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was too much beloved to be parted with.
<p/>It was easy to decide that she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was still too young; and Jane remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious mixture of home and amusement, with only the drawback of the future, the sobering suggestions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own good understanding to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) that all this might soon be over.
<p/>The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements.
<p/>That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman, nor could her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents.
<p/>They continued together with unabated regard however, till the marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as soon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) bread to earn.
<p/>This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) less fortunate friend towards entering on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) path of duty; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had now reached the age which her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) own judgment had fixed on for beginning.
<p/>Neither father nor mother could promote, and the daughter could not endure it. The evil day was put off. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had long resolved that one-and-twenty should be the period.
<p/>With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire from all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society, peace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.
<p/>As long as they lived, no exertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and for their own comfort they would have retained her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) wholly; but this would be selfishness:--what must be at last, had better be soon.
<p/>Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay, and spared her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished.
<p/>The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a resolution, though their feelings did. Still, however, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had never been quite well since the time of their daughter's marriage; and till she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) should have completely recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) usual strength, they must forbid her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) engaging in duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances, to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort.
<p/>With regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) not accompanying them to Ireland, her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) account to her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths not told.
<p/>It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was so very dear: and the Campbells, whatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double, or treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that they depended more on a few months spent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) native air, for the recovery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) health, than on any thing else.
<p/>Certain it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was to come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it--Mr.
<p/>Frank Churchill--must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness of a two years' absence.
<p/>Emma was sorry;--to have to pay civilities to a person she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not like through three long months!--to be always doing more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished, and less than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ought!
<p/>might be a difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) it was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the really accomplished young woman, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) conscience could not quite acquit her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/>But <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could never get acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not know how it was, but there was such coldness and reserve--such apparent indifference whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pleased or not--and then, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) aunt was such an eternal talker!--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was made such a fuss with by every body!--and
<p/>Why she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not like Jane Fairfax it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate-- because their ages were the same, every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other.
<p/>It was a dislike so little just--every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence, without feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had injured her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>); and now, when the due visit was paid, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) arrival, after a two years' interval, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners, which for those two whole years she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had been depreciating.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>These were her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) reasons--she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had no better. Jane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had herself the highest value for elegance.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) height was pretty, just such as almost every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall; her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) figure particularly graceful
<p/>; her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) size a most becoming medium, between fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two.
<p/>Emma could not but feel all this; and then, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face--her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) features--there was more beauty in them altogether than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very pleasing beauty.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom.
<p/>It was a style of beauty, of which elegance was the reigning character, and as such, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must, in honour, by all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) principles, admire it:--elegance, which, whether of person or of mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw so little in Highbury.
<p/>There, not to be vulgar, was distinction, and merit. In short, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency;
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) took in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) history, indeed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) situation, as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) beauty; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was going to sink from, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was going to live, it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every well-known particular entitling her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) to interest, were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had so naturally started to herself.
<p/>the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice, and was determining that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) would dislike her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) no longer. In that case, nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had resolved on.
<p/>Emma was very willing now to acquit her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) of having seduced Mr. Dixon's actions from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) wife, or of any thing mischievous which her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) imagination had suggested at first.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his (<font color='blue'><b>sharer</b></font>) conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend; and from the best, the purest of motives, might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to divide herself effectually from him (<font color='blue'><b>sharer</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>sharer</b></font>) connexions by soon beginning her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) career of laborious duty.
<p/>Upon the whole, Emma left her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with such softened, charitable feelings, as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) independence; nobody that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could wish to scheme about for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/>If it were love, it might be simple, single, successless love on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) side alone. These were charming feelings--but not lasting.
<p/>Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) certainly is handsome; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) is better than handsome!
<p/>Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state.
<p/>The aunt was as tiresome as ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) health was now added to admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) powers; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) ate for breakfast, and how small a slice of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again.
<p/>They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) an affectation of candour, an air of greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own very superior performance.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>Former provocations reappeared. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was, besides, which was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious! There was no getting at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) real opinion.
<p/>If any thing could be more, where all was most, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was more reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own value for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match.
<p/>Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed determined to hazard nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved. It was all general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or distinguished.
<p/>It did her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) no service however. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) caution was thrown away. Emma saw its artifice, and returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) first surmises.
<p/>There probably was something more to conceal than her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps, had been very near changing one friend for the other, or been fixed only to Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.
<p/>It was known that they were a little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma procure as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) truly was.
<p/>The like reserve prevailed on other topics. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and Mr. Frank Churchill had been at Weymouth at the same time. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) appear a sensible young man; a young man of information?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``At a watering-place, or in a common London acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points.
<p/>Manners were all that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of Mr. Churchill.
<p/>Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) handsome?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was reckoned a very fine young man.''

(<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) believed every body found his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) manners pleasing.
<p/>CHAPTER III Emma could not forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>);--but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business with Mr. Woodhouse, his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) approbation of the whole; not so openly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) might have done had her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father been out of the room, but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma.
<p/>'' Emma could not forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had been used to think her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) unjust to Jane, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement.
<p/>A very pleasant evening,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary, told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) understood, and the papers swept away;--<div class="bookquote">``particularly pleasant.
<p/>I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than sitting at one's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music. I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma.
<p/>I was glad you made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) play so much, for having no instrument at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence.
<p/>You left nothing undone. '' <div class="bookquote">``I am happy you approved,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, smiling; <div class="bookquote">``but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield.

<p/>If any thing, you are too attentive. The muffin last night--if it had been handed round once, I think it would have been enough.''
<p/>No,'' said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; <div class="bookquote">``you are not often deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>I think you understand me, therefore. '' An arch look expressed--<div class="bookquote">``I understand you well enough;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said only, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Fairfax is reserved.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I always told you she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was--a little; but you will soon overcome all that part of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has its foundation in diffidence.
<p/>My dear Emma,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), moving from his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) chair into one close by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant evening.
<p/>What arises from discretion must be honoured. ''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You think her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) diffident. I do not see it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' Oh!
<p/>no ; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions; and amused to think how little information I obtained.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am disappointed,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) only answer. '' I hope every body had a pleasant evening,'' said Mr. Woodhouse, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) quiet way.
<p/>Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but then I moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me.
<p/>'' I had. Miss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) always is, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) speaks rather too quick. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is very agreeable, and Mrs. Bates too, in a different way.
<p/>I like old friends; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must have found the evening agreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had Emma. '' <div class="bookquote">``True, sir; and Emma, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had Miss Fairfax.
<p/>Emma saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the present, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's eyes from. I am always watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to admire; and I do pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) from my heart.
<p/>Mr. Knightley looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were more gratified than he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) cared to express; and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whose thoughts were on the Bates's, said--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined! a great pity indeed! and I have often wished--but
<p/>it is so little one can venture to do--small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon-- Now we have killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg
<p/>; it is very small and delicate--Hartfield pork is not like any other pork--but still it is pork--and, my dear Emma, unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks, nicely fried, as ours are fried, without the smallest grease, and not roast it, for no stomach can bear roast pork--
<p/>I think we had better send the leg--do not you think so, my dear?''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>'' My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter.
<p/>There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice, and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like.''
<p/>I knew you would wish it. '' That's right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it before, but that is the best way.
<p/>They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Emma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley presently, <div class="bookquote">``I have a piece of news for you. You like news--and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had time only to say, <div class="bookquote">``No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>when the door was thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``News! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it?--why do you smile so?--where did you hear it?--at Randalls? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>Full of thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest.
<p/>Mr. Knightley soon saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) moment, and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).
<p/>'' Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? My dear Miss Woodhouse--I come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork!
<p/>Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was so completely surprized that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not avoid a little start, and a little blush, at the sound.
<p/>There is my news:--I thought it would interest you,'' said Mr. Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them.
<p/>You are too bountiful! Have you heard the news? Mr. Elton is going to be married. '' '' '' But where could you hear it?'' cried Miss Bates.
<p/>For it is not five minutes since I received Mrs. Cole's note--no, it cannot be more than five--or at least ten--for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come out--I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork--Jane was standing in the passage--were not you,
<p/>'' Where could you possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? Jane?--for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting-pan large enough.
<p/>So I said I would go down and see, and Jane said, `Shall I go down instead? for I think you have a little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.'--`Oh!
<p/>my dear,' said I--well, and just then came the note. A Miss Hawkins--that's all I know. A Miss Hawkins of Bath.
<p/>But, Mr. Knightley, how could you possibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) sat down and wrote to me.
<p/>A Miss Hawkins--'' <div class="bookquote">``I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had just read Elton's letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me directly.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Hawkins</b></font>)</div>'' Well! that is quite--I suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too bountiful.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We consider our Hartfield pork,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Woodhouse--<div class="bookquote">``indeed it certainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I cannot have a greater pleasure than--''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>My mother desires her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) very best compliments and regards, and a thousand thanks, and says you really quite oppress her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).'' ''
<p/>If ever there were people who, without having great wealth themselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us.
<p/>Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good to us. We may well say that `our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.'
<p/>Well, Mr. Knightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well-- '' <div class="bookquote">``It was short--merely to announce--but cheerful, exulting, of course.'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>--
<p/>Here was a sly glance at Emma. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had been so fortunate as to--I forget the precise words--one has no business to remember them.
<p/>The information was, as you state, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins. By his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) style, I should imagine it just settled.''
<p/>'' Mr. Elton going to be married!'' said Emma, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could speak. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) will have every body's wishes for his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) happiness.''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is very young to settle,'' was Mr. Woodhouse's observation. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had better not be in a hurry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) seemed to me very well off as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was.
<p/>We were always glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) at Hartfield.'' '' A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!'' said Miss Bates, joyfully; <div class="bookquote">``my mother is so
<p/>pleased!--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cannot bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>Jane's curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). '' No--I have never seen Mr. Elton,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) replied, starting on this appeal; <div class="bookquote">``is he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)--is he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) a tall man?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Who shall answer that question? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma. '' My father would say `yes,' Mr. Knightley `no;' and Miss Bates and I that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is just the happy medium.
<p/>When you have been here a little longer, Miss Fairfax, you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury, both in person and mind.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) will. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is the very best young man-- But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was precisely the height of Mr. Perry.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) extreme attention to my mother--wanting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to sit in the vicarage pew, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might hear the better, for my mother is a little deaf, you know--it is not much, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does not hear quite quick.
<p/>Miss Hawkins,--I dare say, an excellent young woman. Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) fancied bathing might be good for it--the warm bath--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) says it did him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) no lasting benefit.
<p/>Colonel Campbell, you know, is quite our angel. And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man, quite worthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>).
<p/>Now, here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles, such very good people; and the Perrys
<p/>It is such a happiness when good people get together--and they always do. --I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry.
<p/>I always say, we are quite blessed in our neighbours.--My dear sir, if there is one thing my mother loves better than another, it is pork--a roast loin of pork--

<p/>I say, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>turning to Mr. Woodhouse, <div class="bookquote">``I think there are few places with such society as Highbury. One feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) has been gone only four weeks. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>Nobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings, Emma said, <div class="bookquote">``You are silent, Miss Fairfax--but
<p/>You, who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects, who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell's account--we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss Woodhouse,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bates, <div class="bookquote">``four weeks yesterday.--A Miss Hawkins!--Well, I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts; not that I ever--

<p/>I do not pretend to it. What is before me, I see. At the same time, nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired--Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on, so good-humouredly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) knows I would not offend for the world. How does Miss Smith do? She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) seems quite recovered now. Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately?

<p/>'' Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a regard, I always think a person well-looking.
<p/>But I gave what I believed the general opinion, when I called him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) plain.'' '' Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away.
<p/>The weather does not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are too obliging, my dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take leave.
<p/>I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole's; but I shall not stop three minutes: and, Jane, you had better go home directly
<p/>This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed. --I would not have you out in a shower!--We think she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is the better for Highbury already.
<p/>I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard, for I really do not think she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) cares for any thing but boiled pork: when we dress the leg it will be another thing.
<p/>Thank you, we do indeed. Good morning to you, my dear sir. Oh! Mr. Knightley is coming too. Well, that is so very!--I am sure
<p/>if Jane is tired, you will be so kind as to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) your arm.--Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!--Good morning to you.
<p/>Emma, alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, had half her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attention wanted by him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry--and to marry strangers too--and the other half she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could give to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own view of the subject.
<p/>It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news, as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was sorry for Harriet:
<p/>Harriet must feel it--and all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could hope was, by giving the first information herself, to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) from hearing it abruptly from others.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) were to meet Miss Bates in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) way!--and upon its beginning to rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at Mrs. Goddard's, and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) without preparation.
<p/>The shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes, when in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the <div class="bookquote">``Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>which instantly burst forth, had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation.
<p/>As the blow was given, Emma felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not now shew greater kindness than in listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly through what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had to tell.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had set out from Mrs. Goddard's half an hour ago--she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had been afraid it would rain--she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had been afraid it would pour down every moment--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) might get to Hartfield first
<p/>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had hurried on as fast as possible; but then, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would just step in and see how it went on; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not seem to stay half a moment there, soon after she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came out
<p/>it began to rain, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not know what to do; so she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ran on directly, as fast as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could, and took shelter at Ford's.''--Ford's was the principal woollen-draper, linen-draper, and
<p/>'' It was now about the time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ford</b></font>) was likely to call. '' haberdasher's shop united; the shop first in size and fashion in the place.--<div class="bookquote">``And
<p/>so, there she (<font color='blue'><b>Ford</b></font>) had set, without an idea of any thing in the world, full ten minutes, perhaps--when, all of a sudden, who should come in--to be sure it was so very

<p/>I did not know what to do. I was sitting near the door--Elizabeth saw me directly; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did not; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was busy with the umbrella.
<p/>I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw me, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) looked away directly, and took no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop; and I kept sitting near the door!--Oh!
<p/>I could not go away you know, because of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there.--Oh!
<p/>dear ; I was so miserable! I am sure I must have been as white as my gown. dear, Miss Woodhouse--well, at last
<p/>, I fancy, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked round and saw me; for instead of going on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) buyings, they began whispering to one another.
<p/>I am sure they were talking of me; and I could not help thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was persuading her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to speak to me---LRB-do
<p/>you think he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was, Miss Woodhouse?-RRB---for presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) came forward--came quite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake hands, if I would.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) did not do any of it in the same way that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) used; I could see she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was altered; but, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) seemed to try to be very friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time; but I know no more what I said--I was in such a tremble!--I remember she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind!
<p/>By that time, it was beginning to hold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away--and then--only think!--I found he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was coming up towards me too--slowly you know, and as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) did not quite know what to do; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) came and spoke, and I answered--and I stood for a minute, feeling dreadfully, you know, one can't tell how
<p/>; and then I took courage, and said it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got three yards from the door,
<p/>when he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) came after me, only to say, if I was going to Hartfield, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole's stables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain.
<p/>Dear, Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! Oh! dear, I thought it would have been the death of me! So I said, I was very much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>):
<p/>you know I could not do less; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) went back to Elizabeth, and I came round by the stables--
<p/>I believe I did--but I hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I would rather done any thing
<p/>than have it happen: and yet, you know, there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) behave so pleasantly and so kindly.
<p/>And Elizabeth, too. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me and make me comfortable again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) power.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was obliged to stop and think. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not thoroughly comfortable herself. The young man's conduct, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister's, seemed the result of real feeling, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could not but pity them.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had believed them to be well-meaning, worthy people before; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion?
<p/>As Harriet described it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour. It was folly to be disturbed by it.
<p/>Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be sorry to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)--they must be all sorry. Ambition, as well as love, had probably been mortified.
<p/>They might all have hoped to rise by Harriet's acquaintance: and besides, what was the value of Harriet's description?--So easily pleased--so little discerning;--what signified her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) praise?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) exerted herself, and did try to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) comfortable, by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of being dwelt on, <div class="bookquote">``It might be distressing, for the moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>);
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but you seem to have behaved extremely well; and it is over--and may never--can never, as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need not think about it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet said, <div class="bookquote">``very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``would not think about it;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but still she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) talked of it--still she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could talk of nothing else; and Emma, at last, in order to put the Martins out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head, was obliged to hurry on the news, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had meant to give with so much tender caution; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only amused, at such a state of mind in poor Harriet--such a conclusion of Mr. Elton's importance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)!
<p/>Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did not feel the first intelligence as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might have done the day before, or an hour before, its interest soon increased; and before their first conversation was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity, wonder and regret, pain and pleasure, as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins, which could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) fancy.
<p/>Mr. Elton's rights, however, gradually revived. Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting. It had been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining any influence to alarm.
<p/>As Harriet now lived, the Martins could not get at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), without seeking her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>); for since her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) refusal of the brother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard's; and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again, with any necessity, or even any power of speech.
<p/>CHAPTER IV Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is sure of being kindly spoken of.
<p/>A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins's name was first mentioned in Highbury, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) was, by some means or other, discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind; to be handsome, elegant, highly accomplished, and perfectly amiable: and when Mr. Elton himself arrived to triumph in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) happy prospects, and circulate the fame of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) merits, there was very little more for him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to do, than to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) Christian name, and say whose music she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) principally played.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had gone away rejected and mortified--disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of what appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) strong encouragement; and not only losing the right lady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had gone away deeply offended--he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) came back engaged to another--and to another as superior, of course, to the first, as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost.
<p/>Mr. Elton returned, a very happy man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) came back gay and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse, and defying Miss Smith.
<p/>The charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent fortune, of so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of some dignity, as well as some convenience: the story told well
<p/>; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) had not thrown himself away--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) had gained a woman of 10,000 l. or thereabouts; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) had gained her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with such delightful rapidity--the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice; the history which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) had to give Mrs. Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious--the steps so quick, from the accidental rencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green's, and the party at Mrs. Brown's--smiles and blushes rising in importance--with consciousness and agitation richly scattered--the lady had been so easily impressed--so sweetly disposed--had in short, to use a most intelligible phrase, been so very ready to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), that vanity and prudence were equally contented.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had caught both substance and shadow--both fortune and affection, and was just the happy man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to be; talking only of himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own concerns--expecting to be congratulated--ready to be laughed at--and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the young ladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have been more cautiously gallant.
<p/>The wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves to please, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation, which a certain glance of Mrs. Cole's did not seem to contradict, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) next entered Highbury he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would bring his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bride.
<p/>During his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) present short stay, Emma had barely seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the impression of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension, now spread over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) air.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was, in fact, beginning very much to wonder that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had ever thought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleasing at all; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance, a lesson, a source of profitable humiliation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very well; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pain, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction. The pain of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued residence in Highbury, however, must certainly be lessened by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) marriage.
<p/>Many vain solicitudes would be prevented--many awkwardnesses smoothed by it. A Mrs. Elton would be an excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink without remark.
<p/>It would be almost beginning their life of civility again. Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was good enough for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury--handsome enough--to look plain, probably, by Harriet's side.
<p/>As to connexion, there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had done nothing.
<p/>On that article, truth seemed attainable. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was, must be uncertain; but who she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was, might be found out; and setting aside the 10,000 l.
<p/>Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol--merchant, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) must be called; but, as the whole of the profits of his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) mercantile life appeared so very moderate, it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) line of trade had been very moderate also.
<p/>Part of every winter she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) had been used to spend in Bath; but Bristol was her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) home, the very heart of Bristol; for though the father and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remained--in the law line--nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), than that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was in the law line; and with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) the daughter had lived.
<p/>, it did not appear that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was at all Harriet's superior. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) brought no name, no blood, no alliance. Emma guessed him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to be the drudge of some attorney, and too stupid to rise.
<p/>And all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister, who was very well married , to a gentleman in a great way , near Bristol, who kept two carriages!
<p/>That was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) but have given Harriet her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) feelings about it all!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had talked her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) into love; but, alas! she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not so easily to be talked out of it. The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet's mind was not to be talked away.
<p/>; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) certainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient; but nothing else, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) feared, would cure her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) might be superseded by another Harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be always in love. And now, poor girl!
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was always having a glimpse of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) somewhere or other.
<p/>Harriet was sure just to meet with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), or just to miss him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), just to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) voice, or see his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) shoulder, just to have something occur to preserve him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) fancy, in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was, moreover, perpetually hearing about him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>); for, excepting when at Hartfield, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton, and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) concerns; and every report, therefore, every guess--all that had already occurred, all that might occur in the arrangement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) affairs, comprehending income, servants, and furniture, was continually in agitation around her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) regrets kept alive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins's happiness, and continual observation of, how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) seemed attached!--his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) air as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) walked by the house--the very sitting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) hat, being all in proof of how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was in love!
<p/>Had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) friend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriet's mind, Emma would have been amused by its variations.
<p/>Emma saw him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) only once; but two or three times every day Sometimes Mr. Elton predominated, sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other.
<p/>The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's a few days afterwards.
<p/>Harriet had not been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), written in the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach, with a great deal of kindness; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been much occupied by it, continually pondering over what could be done in return, and wishing to do more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) dared to confess.
<p/>Mr. Elton's engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin. But Mr. Elton, in person, had driven away all such cares.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) staid, the Martins were forgotten; and on the very morning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martins</b></font>) setting off for Bath again, Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned, judged it best for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to return Elizabeth Martin's visit.
<p/>How that visit was to be acknowledged--what would be necessary--and what might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration.
<p/>Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, would be ingratitude. It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance--!
<p/>After much thinking, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could determine on nothing better, than Harriet's returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had understanding, should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) meant to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in the carriage, leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) at the Abbey Mill, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) drove a little farther, and call for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) again so soon, as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could think of nothing better: and though there was something in it which her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own heart could not approve--something of ingratitude, merely glossed over--it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?
<p/>Only half an hour before her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend called for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) at Mrs. Goddard's, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) evil stars had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to The Rev. Philip Elton, White-Hart, Bath , was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher's cart, which was to convey it to where the coaches past; and every thing in this world, excepting that trunk and the direction, was consequently a blank.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was to be put down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led between espalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing which had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning to revive a little local agitation; and when they parted, Emma observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, which determined her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went on herself, to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married, and settled in Donwell.
<p/>The quarter of an hour brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) punctually to the white gate again; and Miss Smith receiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) summons, was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) without delay, and unattended by any alarming young man.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) came solitarily down the gravel walk--a Miss Martin just appearing at the door, and parting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) seemingly with ceremonious civility.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was feeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) enough to understand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was creating.
<p/>CHAPTER V Small heart had Harriet for visiting. Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls.
<p/>They had received her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) doubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time--till just at last, when Mrs. Martin's saying, all of a sudden, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) thought Miss Smith was grown, had brought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner.
<p/>In that very room she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had been measured last September, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) two friends. There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window.
<p/>They all seemed to remember the day, the hour, the party, the occasion--to feel the same consciousness, the same regrets--to be ready to return to the same good understanding; and they were just growing again like themselves, -LRB-Harriet, as Emma must suspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,-RRB- when the carriage reappeared, and all was over.
<p/>Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago!--Emma could not but picture it all, and feel how justly they might resent
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) had done it. The style of the visit, and the shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive. , how naturally Harriet must suffer.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would have given a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had the Martins in a higher rank of life.
<p/>They were so deserving, that a little higher should have been enough: but as it was, how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) have done otherwise?--Impossible!--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not repent.
<p/>They must be separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process--so much to herself at this time, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) soon felt the necessity of a little consolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure it.
<p/>It was a bad business. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins. The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.
<p/>It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that neither <div class="bookquote">``master nor mistress was at home;''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>they had both been out some time; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.
<p/>'' This is too bad,'' cried Emma, as they turned away. '' And now we shall just miss them; too provoking!--I do not know when I have been so disappointed.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) leaned back in the corner, to indulge her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both--such being the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind.
<p/>'' Presently the carriage stopt ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were standing to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).
<p/>There was instant pleasure in the sight of them, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound--for Mr. Weston immediately accosted her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) with, <div class="bookquote">``How d'ye do?--how
<p/>Frank comes to-morrow--I had a letter this morning--we see him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty--he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) is at Oxford to-day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) comes for a whole fortnight
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had come at Christmas he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) could not have staid three days; I was always glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) did not come at Christmas; now we are going to have just the right weather for him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), fine, dry, settled weather.
<p/>d'ye do?--We have been sitting with your father--glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so well. ; I knew it would be so. We shall enjoy him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish.
<p/>There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston's, confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife, fewer and quieter, but not less to the purpose.
<p/>To know that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) rejoice in their joy.
<p/>The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming; and in the rapidity of half a moment's thought, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more.
<p/>Mr. Weston gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the history of the engagements at Enscombe, which allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) command, as well as the route and the method of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) journey; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) listened, and smiled, and congratulated.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits. '' I shall soon bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) over to Hartfield,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), at the conclusion.
<p/>Emma could imagine she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife. '' We had better move on, Mr. Weston,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``we are detaining the girls.
<p/>Well, well, I am ready;'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and turning again to Emma, <div class="bookquote">``but you must not be expecting such a very fine young man; you have only had my account you know
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' ; I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is really nothing extraordinary:''--though his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o'clock,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>was Mrs. Weston's parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant only for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).
<p/>Four o'clock!--depend upon it he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be here by three,'' was Mr. Weston's quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting.
<p/>Emma's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore a different air; James and his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) horses seemed not half so sluggish as before.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked at the hedges, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought the elder at least must soon be coming out; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) turned round to Harriet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.
<p/>Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing. '' '' Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?''--was a question, however, which did not augur much.
<p/>But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.
<p/>The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston's faithful pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o'clock, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) at four.
<p/>My dear, dear anxious friend,''--said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), in mental soliloquy, while walking downstairs from her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own room, <div class="bookquote">``always overcareful for every body's comfort but your own; I see you now in all your little fidgets, going again and again into his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) room, to be sure that all is right.
<p/>; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence; and by this time to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later, I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' The clock struck twelve as she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) passed through the hall. '' ' Tis twelve I am sure they will bring him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) soon.
<p/>They had been arrived only a few minutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) explanation of Frank's being a day before his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) time, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) father was yet in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) very civil welcome and congratulations, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) appeared, to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.
<p/>The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was actually before her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not think too much had been said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) praise; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was a very good looking young man; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) looked quick and sensible.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) felt immediately that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should like him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>); and there was a well-bred ease of manner, and a readiness to talk, which convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) came intending to be acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), and that acquainted they soon must be.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) father--Mr. Weston and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had reached Randalls the evening before.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) alter his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) plan, and travel earlier, later, and quicker, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might gain half a day.
<p/>I told you yesterday,'' cried Mr. Weston with exultation, <div class="bookquote">``I told you all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would be here before the time named.
<p/>One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in upon one's friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, <div class="bookquote">``though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far; but in coming home I felt I might do any thing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>I remembered what I used to do myself. '' The word home made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father look on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with fresh complacency.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very much pleased with Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house, would hardly allow it even to be very small, admired the situation, the walk to Highbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more, and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one's own country gives, and the greatest curiosity to visit it.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before, passed suspiciously through Emma's brain; but still, if it were a falsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled.
<p/>Emma was directly sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew how to make himself agreeable; the conviction was strengthened by what followed. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner had no air of study or exaggeration.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment. Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) side were the inquiries,--<div class="bookquote">``Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) a horsewoman?--Pleasant rides?--Pleasant walks?--Had they a large neighbourhood?--Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough?--There were several very pretty houses in and about it.--Balls--
<p/>But when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance proportionably advanced, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) contrived to find an opportunity, while their two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) mother-in-law, and speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) with so much handsome praise, so much warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) secured to his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) father, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) very kind reception of himself, as was an additional proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) knowing how to please--and of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) did not advance a word of praise beyond what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother-in-law</b></font>) knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston; but, undoubtedly he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) could know very little of the matter.
<p/>had they balls?--Was it a musical society? ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) understood what would be welcome; he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) could be sure of little else.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) father's marriage,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) said, ``had been the wisest measure, every friend must rejoice in it; and the family from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) got as near as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could to thanking her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) for Miss Taylor's merits, without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse's character, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's.
<p/>And at last, as if resolved to qualify his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) opinion completely for travelling round to its object, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) person.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but I confess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than a very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma; <div class="bookquote">``were you to guess her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be eighteen , I should listen with pleasure; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' '' Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); Don't let her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) imagine that you have spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) as a pretty young woman.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I should know better,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``no, depend upon it, -LRB-with a gallant bow,-RRB- that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind, had ever crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must see more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ways; at present she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) only felt they were agreeable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) quick eye she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression; and even, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might have determined not to look, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was confident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was often listening.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own father's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, the entire deficiency in him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) of all such sort of penetration or suspicion, was a most comfortable circumstance.
<p/>Happily he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it.--Though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any; it seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could not think so ill of any two persons' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could now, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) guest, give way to all his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr. Frank Churchill's accommodation on his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) journey, through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had certainly escaped catching cold--which, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to feel quite assured of himself till after another night.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had business at the Crown about his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hay, and a great many errands for Mrs. Weston at Ford's, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) need not hurry any body else.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) son, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also, saying, ``As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the opportunity of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other, and therefore may as well be paid now.
<p/>I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours, -LRB-turning to Emma,-RRB- a lady residing in or near Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax.
<p/>I shall have no difficulty, I suppose, in finding the house; though Fairfax, I believe, is not the proper name--I should rather say Barnes, or Bates.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) blessed the favouring blindness. A reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move.--<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must be going. ''  (<font color='red'><b>any family</b></font>)</div>Do you know any family of that name?''
<p/>True, true, you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) at Weymouth, and a fine girl she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is.
<p/>'' To be sure we do,'' cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) father; <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Bates--we passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) house--I saw Miss Bates at the window. Call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), by all means.
<p/>There is no necessity for my calling this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said the young man; <div class="bookquote">``another day would do as well; but there was that degree of acquaintance at Weymouth which--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be done cannot be done too soon.
<p/>You saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) with the Campbells, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was the equal of every body she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) mixed with, but here she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is with a poor old grandmother, who has barely enough to live on.
<p/>And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank; any want of attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) here should be carefully avoided. If you do not call early it will be a slight.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>The son looked convinced. '' I have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) speak of the acquaintance,'' said Emma; ``she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is a very elegant young woman.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) agreed to it, but with so quiet a <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>as inclined her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) almost to doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it.
<p/>You will see her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) to advantage; see her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) and hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)--no, I am afraid you will not hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) at all, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) has an aunt who never holds her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) tongue.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse, always the last to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) way in conversation; <div class="bookquote">``then give me leave to assure you that you will find her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) a very agreeable young lady.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) is staying here on a visit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) grandmama and aunt, very worthy people; I have known them all my life.
<p/>They will be extremely glad to see you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' If you were never particularly struck by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) manners before,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I think you will to-day. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>But your father is not going so far; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is only going to the Crown, quite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many houses
<p/>; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk, unless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street.
<p/>Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hearty support by calling out, <div class="bookquote">``My good friend, this is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) sees it, and as to Mrs. Bates's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) may get there from the Crown in a hop, step, and jump.
<p/>They were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one, and a graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave.
<p/>Emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day, with full confidence in their comfort.
<p/>My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' CHAPTER VI The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), it appeared, most companionably at home, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their walk, immediately fixed on Highbury.--<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) should always chuse the same.
<p/>Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury, would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) constant attraction.'' (<font color='red'><b>-- Highbury</b></font>)</div>--Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood for Hartfield; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) trusted to its bearing the same construction with him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>).
<p/>Emma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in for half a minute, in order to hear that his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son was very handsome, knew nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm in arm.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was wanting to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) again, and especially to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) in company with Mrs. Weston, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) behaviour to whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was to depend.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) came with Mrs. Weston, to whom and to Highbury he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) seemed to take very cordially. They walked thither directly. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) were deficient there, nothing should make amends for it.
<p/>It was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) whole manner to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)--nothing could more agreeably denote his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wish of considering her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) as a friend and securing her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) affection.
<p/>And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of the morning.
<p/>They were all three walking about together for an hour or two--first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards in Highbury.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther was resolved on, confessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) wish to be made acquainted with the whole village, and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) begged to be shewn the house which his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) father had lived in so long, and which had been the home of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) father's father; and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was still living, walked in quest of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they shewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must be very like a merit to those he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was with.
<p/>Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it could not be fairly supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had been ever voluntarily absenting himself; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had not been acting a part, or making a parade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) justice.
<p/>Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there; but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago for a ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as such;--but such brilliant days had long passed away, and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place.
<p/>But on seeing them together, she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) became perfectly satisfied. Some of the objects of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was immediately interested.
<p/>Its character as a ball-room caught him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>); and instead of passing on, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities, and lament that its original purpose should have ceased.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) saw no fault in the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would acknowledge none which they suggested. No, it was long enough, broad enough, handsome enough.
<p/>It would hold the very number for comfort. They ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter.
<p/>Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room?--She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) who could do any thing in Highbury!
<p/>The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend, were mentioned; but he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was not satisfied.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could not be persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) saw around him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars were given and families described, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing, or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body's returning into their proper place the next morning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) argued like a young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) seemed to have all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social inclinations of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe.
<p/>Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) indifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could be no judge, however, of the evil he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was holding cheap. It was but an effusion of lively spirits.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown; and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emma recollected his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) intended visit the day before, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had paid it.
<p/>'' Yes, oh! yes''--he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">``I was just going to mention it. A very successful visit:--I saw all the three ladies; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint.
<p/>If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit.
<p/>Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--but there was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I found, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) -LRB-finding me nowhere else-RRB- joined me there at last, that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an hour.
<p/>The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?''
<p/>'' Ill, very ill--that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it?
<p/>Ladies can never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill
<p/>health.--A most deplorable want of complexion. '' Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax's complexion.
<p/>It was certainly never brilliant, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness and delicacy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) listened with all due deference; acknowledged that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had heard many people say the same--but yet he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) must confess, that to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health.
<p/>Where features were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them all; and where they were good, the effect was--fortunately he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) need not attempt to describe what the effect was.
<p/>'' '' '' Well,'' said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``there is no disputing about taste.--At least you admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) except her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) complexion. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) head and laughed.--<div class="bookquote">``I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) complexion.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you see her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same society? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ford/Mrs. Ford</b></font>)</div>At this moment they were approaching Ford's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) hastily exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Ha!
<p/>this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives, as my father informs me. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comes to Highbury himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford's.
<p/>If it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove myself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury.
<p/>I must buy something at Ford's. It will be taking out my freedom.--I dare say they sell gloves.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! yes, gloves and every thing.
<p/>You were very popular before you came, because you were Mr. Weston's son--but lay out half a guinea at Ford's, and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues.
<p/>They went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of <div class="bookquote">``Men's Beavers''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``York Tan''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>were bringing down and displaying on the counter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tan</b></font>) said--<div class="bookquote">``But
<p/>I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking to me, you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my amor patriae .

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a very unfair one. It is always the lady's right to decide on the degree of acquaintance.
<p/>Miss Fairfax must already have given her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) account.--I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may chuse to allow.
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is so very reserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about any body, that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could do herself. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>May I, indeed?--Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so well.
<p/>I met her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells a little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set.
<p/>Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly, warm-hearted woman. I like them all. '' <div class="bookquote">``You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) is destined to be?''

<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) fully understood and honoured such a sentiment. '' Ever hear her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)!'' repeated Emma. '' You forget how much she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) belongs to Highbury.
<p/>I have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) every year of our lives since we both began. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) plays charmingly.'' <div class="bookquote">``You think so, do you?--I wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) appeared to me to play well, that is, with considerable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself.--I am excessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body's performance.--I have been used to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s admired; and I remember one proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) being thought to play well:--a man, a very musical man, and in love with another woman--engaged to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)--on the point of marriage--would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit down instead--never seemed to like to hear one if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hear the other.
<p/>That, I thought, in a man of known musical talent, was some proof.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Proof indeed!''

<p/>We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you, than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly--very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal stronger than, if I had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all agreeable to me.
<p/>I could not excuse a man's having more music than love--more ear than eye--a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dixon/Dixon</b></font>)</div>Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a very strong proof. '' How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?''
<p/>One would rather have a stranger preferred than one's very particular friend--with a stranger it might not recur again--but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself!--Poor Mrs. Dixon!

<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) really did not seem to feel it.
<p/>But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>)--quickness of friendship, or dulness of feeling--there was one person, I think, who must have felt it:
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So much the better--or so much the worse:--I do not know which. Miss Fairfax herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' As to that--I do not--'' '' Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax's sensations from you, or from any body else.
<p/>They are known to no human being, I guess, but herself. But if she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) continued to play whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses.
<p/>There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all--'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, ``however, it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were--how it might all be behind the scenes.
<p/>But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must be a better judge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) character, and of how she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) is likely to conduct herself in critical situations, than I can be.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have known her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children and women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate,--that we should have taken to each other whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) friends.
<p/>I hardly know how it has happened; a little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) always was, by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) aunt and grandmother, and all their set.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly. '' But we never did. And then, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) reserve--I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>). '' Oftentimes very convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety in reserve, but no attraction.
<p/>One cannot love a reserved person. '' <div class="bookquote">``Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction may be the greater.
<p/>But I must be more in want of a friend, or an agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble of conquering any body's reserve to procure one.
<p/>I have no reason to think ill of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)--not the least--except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) perfectly agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>): and after walking together so long, and thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was not exactly what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had expected; less of the man of the world in some of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, therefore better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had expected.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was particularly struck by his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) manner of considering Mr. Elton's house, which, as well as the church, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) would go and look at, and would not join them in finding much fault with.
<p/>No, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) could not believe it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having.
<p/>If it were to be shared with the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not think any man to be pitied for having that house.
<p/>Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ideas seemed more moderate--his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feelings warmer. There must be ample room in it for every real comfort.
<p/>The man must be a blockhead who wanted more. Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not know what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was talking about.
<p/>Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one.
<p/>But Emma, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own mind, determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did know what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was talking about, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper's room, or a bad butler's pantry, but no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) happy, and that whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) were attached, he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment.
<p/>CHAPTER VII Emma's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the following day, by hearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was gone off to London, merely to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hair cut.
<p/>A sudden freak seemed to have seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) at breakfast, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to return to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared than having his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hair cut.
<p/>There was certainly no harm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not approve.
<p/>It did not accord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense, or even the unselfish warmth of heart, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had believed herself to discern in him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) yesterday.
<p/>; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father and Mrs. Weston, indifferent as to how his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) conduct might appear in general; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) became liable to all these charges.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father only called him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) a coxcomb, and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it, was clear enough, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) passing it over as quickly as possible, and making no other comment than that <div class="bookquote">``all young people would have their little whims.
<p/>With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) visit hitherto had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend only good ideas of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>).
<p/>Mrs. Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) made himself--how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) saw to like in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) disposition altogether.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) appeared to have a very open temper--certainly a very cheerful and lively one; she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could observe nothing wrong in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) notions, a great deal decidedly right; he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) uncle with warm regard, was fond of talking of him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)--said he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) would be the best man in the world if he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) were left to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) acknowledged her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) with respect.
<p/>This was all very promising; and, but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) hair cut, there was nothing to denote him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) unworthy of the distinguished honour which her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) imagination had given him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>); the honour, if not of being really in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), of being at least very near it, and saved only by her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) own
<p/>indifference---LRB-for still her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) resolution held of never marrying-RRB---the honour, in short, of being marked out for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) by all their joint acquaintance.
<p/>Vanity, extravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>Mr. Weston, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) side, added a virtue to the account which must have some weight.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to understand that Frank admired her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) extremely--thought her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) very beautiful and very charming; and with so much to be said for him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) altogether, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) found she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) must not judge him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) harshly.
<p/>As Mrs. Weston observed, <div class="bookquote">``all young people would have their little whims. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>There was one person among his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) new acquaintance in Surry, not so leniently disposed.
<p/>In general he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was judged, throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man--one who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles--Mr.
<p/>The circumstance was told him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) at Hartfield; for the moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was silent; but Emma heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) almost immediately afterwards say to himself, over a newspaper he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``Hum!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had half a mind to resent; but an instant's observation convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that it was really said only to relieve his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) let it pass.
<p/>Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and Mrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune.
<p/>Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make Emma want their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted exactly the advice they gave.
<p/>This was the occurrence:--The Coles had been settled some years in Highbury, and were very good sort of people--friendly, liberal, and unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in trade, and only moderately genteel.
<p/>On their first coming into the country, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping little company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means--the house in town had yielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them.
<p/>Knightley. just the trifling, silly fellow I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) for. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>With their wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house, their inclination for more company.
<p/>They added to their house, to their number of servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this time were, in fortune and style of living, second only to the family at Hartfield.
<p/>Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among the single men, had already taken place.
<p/>Nothing should tempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) to go, if they did; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) regretted that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father's known habits would be giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) refusal less meaning than she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) could wish.
<p/>The Coles were very respectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them.
<p/>This lesson, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) very much feared, they would receive only from herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) very differently affected.
<p/>Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation, and none had come for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father and herself; and Mrs. Weston's accounting for it with
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose they will not take the liberty with you; they know you do not dine out,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>was not quite sufficient.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should like to have had the power of refusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled there, consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), occurred again and again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might not have been tempted to accept.
<p/>The regular and best families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite--neither Donwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses.
<p/>They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before, and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) absence.
<p/>The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) spirits; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.
<p/>It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) first remark, on reading it, was that <div class="bookquote">``of course it must be declined,''  (<font color='red'><b>Westons</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to do, that their advice for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) going was most prompt and successful.
<p/>Might not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of his (<font color='blue'><b>Westons</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) owned that, considering every thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not absolutely without inclination for the party.
<p/>The Coles expressed themselves so properly--there was so much real attention in the manner of it--so much consideration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father.
<p/>They would have solicited the honour earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of air, and therefore induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) the more readily to give them the honour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) company.
<p/>Upon the whole, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was very persuadable; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) comfort--how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates, might be depended on for bearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) company--Mr.
<p/>Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter's going out to dinner on a day now near at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>).
<p/>As for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) going, Emma did not wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to think it possible, the hours would be too late, and the party too numerous.
<p/>'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was soon pretty well resigned. '' I am not fond of dinner-visiting,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``I never was. No more is Emma.
<p/>I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us--take us in their afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so reasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening.
<p/>Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to.
<p/>However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what it ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then turning to Mrs. Weston, with a look of gentle reproach--<div class="bookquote">``Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had not married, you would have staid at home with me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, sir,'' cried Mr. Weston, <div class="bookquote">``as I took Miss Taylor away, it is incumbent on me to supply her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment, if you wish it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>'' But the idea of any thing to be done in a moment , was increasing, not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation.
<p/>The ladies knew better how to allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately arranged. With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/>James could take the note. But first of all, there must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole.'' <div class="bookquote">``You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible.
<p/>You will say that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must decline their obliging invitation; beginning with my compliments , of course.
<p/>But you will do every thing right. I need not tell you what is to be done. We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday.
<p/>We have never been there above once since the new approach was made; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely.
<p/>And when you get there, you must tell him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) at what time you would have him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) come for you again; and you had better name an early hour.
<p/>I shall have no fears for you with him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). You will not like staying late. You will get very tired when tea is over.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?'' '' Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired.
<p/>There will be a great many people talking at once. You will not like the noise.'' '' But, my dear sir,'' cried Mr. Weston, <div class="bookquote">``if Emma comes away early, it will be breaking up the party.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And no great harm if it does,'' said Mr. Woodhouse. '' The sooner every party breaks up, the better.'' ''
<p/>But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma's going away directly after tea might be giving offence.
<p/>They are good-natured people, and think little of their own claims; but still they must feel that any body's hurrying away is no great compliment; and Miss Woodhouse's doing
<p/>it would be more thought of than any other person's in the room. You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles
<p/>, I am sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who have been your neighbours these ten years.
<p/>'' '' No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to you for reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain.
<p/>I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor. You would not think it to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) is bilious--
<p/>Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I would not be the means of giving them any pain. My dear Emma, we must consider this.
<p/>I am sure, rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a little longer than you might wish.
<p/>I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account.
<p/>You will not regard being tired. You will be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends.'' '' Oh yes, papa. I am only afraid of your sitting up for me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) loves piquet, you know; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time--and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort.
<p/>I am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard. You must promise me not to sit up.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) did, on the condition of some promises on her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) side: such as that, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) came home cold, she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; if hungry, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) would take something to eat; that her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) own maid should sit up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>); and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house, as usual.
<p/>CHAPTER VIII Frank Churchill came back again; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's dinner waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious for his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray any imperfection which could be concealed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) came back, had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hair cut, and laughed at himself with a very good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had done.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had no reason to wish his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hair longer, to conceal any confusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) spirits.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, after seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), Emma thus moralised to herself:-- <div class="bookquote">``I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not always folly.--It depends upon the character of those who handle it. Mr. Knightley, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is not a trifling, silly young man.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would have done this differently. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would either have gloried in the achievement, or been ashamed of it.
<p/>There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities.--No, I am perfectly sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is not trifling or silly.
<p/>With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) again, and for a longer time than hitherto; of judging of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) general manners, and by inference, of the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) manners towards herself; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to throw coldness into her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) air; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be, who were now seeing them together for the first time.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at Mr. Cole's; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr. Elton, even in the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) favour, none had disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) father's comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs. Goddard being able to come; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) last pleasing duty, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) left the house, was to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) respects to them as they sat together after dinner; and while her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) father was fondly noticing the beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) dress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) power, by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine, for whatever unwilling self-denial his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had provided a plentiful dinner for them
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) followed another carriage to Mr. Cole's door; and was pleased to see that it was Mr. Knightley's; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses, having little spare money and a great deal of health, activity, and independence, was too apt, in Emma's opinion, to get about as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could, and not use his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had an opportunity now of speaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) approbation while warm from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) stopped to hand her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) out.
<p/>'' ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could know that they had been allowed to eat it. '' This is coming as you should do,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``like a gentleman.--I am quite glad to see you.
<p/>for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual.--You might not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), observing, <div class="bookquote">``How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment! ''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>'' Yes I should , I am sure I should.
<p/>There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them.
<p/>but with you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances.
<p/>You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, Now you have nothing to try for. You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed.
<p/>You are not striving to look taller than any body else. Now I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsensical girl! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) reply, but not at all in anger. Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with Mr. Knightley.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was received with a cordial respect which could not but please, and given all the consequence she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could wish for.
<p/>When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest of admiration were for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), from both husband and wife; the son approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with a cheerful eagerness which marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) peculiar object, and at dinner she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) seated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) firmly believed, not without some dexterity on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) side.
<p/>The party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper unobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox's family, the lawyer of Highbury.
<p/>The less worthy females were to come in the evening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; but already, at dinner, they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general; and, while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over, Emma could fairly surrender all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attention to the pleasantness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) neighbour.
<p/>The first remote sound to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt herself obliged to attend, was the name of Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) that was expected to be very interesting.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) listened, and found it well worth listening to. That very dear part of Emma, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fancy, received an amusing supply.
<p/>Mrs. Cole was telling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had been calling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte--a very elegant looking instrument--not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the substance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) side, and explanations on Miss Bates's, was, that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood's the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece--entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates's account, Jane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it--but now, they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter;--of course it must be from Colonel Campbell.
<p/>One can suppose nothing else,'' added Mrs. Cole, <div class="bookquote">``and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) knows their ways best; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cole</b></font>)</div>But Jane, it seems, had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it. They might chuse to surprize her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).
<p/>Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>); every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell, and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own way, and still listen to Mrs. Cole.
<p/>I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction!--It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax, who plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument.
<p/>'' '' It seemed quite a shame, especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away.
<p/>but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole, I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and our little girls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of it; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music,
<p/>has not any thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world, to amuse herself with.--I was saying this to Mr. Cole but yesterday, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) quite agreed with me; only he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) is so particularly fond of music that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) could not help indulging himself in the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought--or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it.--We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening.
<p/>Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole's, turned to Frank Churchill.
<p/>This is like giving ourselves a slap, to be sure! and it was '' '' Why do you smile?'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>).
<p/>'' Nay, why do you?'' <div class="bookquote">``Me!--I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell's being so rich and so liberal.--It is a handsome present.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I rather wonder that it was never made before. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) did not give her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) the use of their own instrument--which must now be shut up in London, untouched by any body.''
<p/>'' '' That is a grand pianoforte, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) might think it too large for Mrs. Bates's house. '' <div class="bookquote">``You may say what you chuse--but your countenance testifies that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I smile because you smile, and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what there is to question.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve. If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can be?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dixon</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?'' '' Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) must know as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) father, how acceptable an instrument would be; and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a young woman's scheme than an elderly man's.
<p/>It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare say. I told you that your suspicions would guide mine.'' '' If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend Mr .
<p/>Dixon in them.'' '' Mr. Dixon.--Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.
<p/>Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had entertained before.--I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting either that, after making his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) proposals to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) had the misfortune to fall in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) , or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) became conscious of a little attachment on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) side.
<p/>One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland.
<p/>We were speaking the other day, you know, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) being so warm an admirer of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) performance.'' '' Here, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) must be leading a life of privation and penance; there it would have been all enjoyment.
<p/>As to the pretence of trying her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) native air, I look upon that as a mere excuse.--In the summer it might have passed; but what can any body's native air do for them in the months of January, February, and March?
<p/>Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I dare say in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>)'s.
<p/>I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions, though you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly tell you what they are.''
<p/>'' And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr. Dixon's preference of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) music to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) friend's, I can answer for being very decided.''
<p/>'' And then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) life. Did you ever hear of that?--A water party; and by some accident she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) was falling overboard.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>).'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) did. I was there--one of the party.'' ``Were you really?--Well!--But you observed nothing of course, for it seems to be a new idea to you.--If
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact, that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>).--It was the work of a moment.
<p/>I had been there, I think I should have made some discoveries. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable--indeed I believe it was
<p/>half an hour before any of us were comfortable again--yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable.
<p/>They were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses, and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when the table was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed exactly right, and occupation and ease were generally restored, Emma said, <div class="bookquote">``The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me.
<p/>I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have made discoveries. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>The conversation was here interrupted. I wanted to know a little more, and this tells me quite enough.
<p/>Depend upon it, we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.'' '' And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the Campbells.''
<p/>'' No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells. Miss Fairfax knows it is not from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first.
<p/>I may not have convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business.''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) would not have been puzzled, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) dared fix on them. <div class="bookquote">``Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced.
<p/>At first, while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only as paternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world.
<p/>But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship.
<p/>Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely. And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was no occasion to press the matter farther. The conviction seemed real; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) felt it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) said no more, other subjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; the dessert succeeded, the children came in, and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever things said, a few downright silly, but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other--nothing worse than everyday remarks, dull repetitions, old news, and heavy jokes.
<p/>Emma watched the entree of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own particular little friend; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not exult in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dignity and grace, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light, cheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so many alleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection.
<p/>The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other ladies, in their different divisions, arrived. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sat--and who would have guessed how many tears she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been lately shedding?
<p/>To be in company, nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and say nothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour.
<p/>Jane Fairfax did look and move superior; but Emma suspected she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved--yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton in vain--by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) felt too much in the secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair, and therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, the subject was almost immediately introduced, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received, the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of <div class="bookquote">``my excellent friend Colonel Campbell.
<p/>Mrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested by the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) perseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) plainly read in the fair heroine's countenance.
<p/>In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of the early was Frank Churchill.
<p/>In he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) walked, the first and the handsomest; and after paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) compliments en passant to Miss Bates and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece, made his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) way directly to the opposite side of the circle, where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could find a seat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), would not sit at all.
<p/>Emma divined what every body present must be thinking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) object, and every body must perceive it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient moments afterwards, heard what each thought of the other.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Only to be sure it was paying him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) too great a compliment, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had never seen so lovely a face, and was delighted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) naivete. '' '' Emma restrained her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) indignation, and only turned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in silence.
<p/>Smiles of intelligence passed between her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and the gentleman on first glancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been impatient to leave the dining-room--hated sitting long--was always the first to move when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could--that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy over parish business--that as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had staid, however, it had been pleasant enough, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether--thought it so abundant in agreeable families--that Emma began to feel she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been used to despise the place rather too much.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) as to the society in Yorkshire--the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort; and could make out from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) answers that, as far as Enscombe was concerned, there was very little going on, that their visitings were among a range of great families, none very near; and that even when days were fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an even chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits for going; that they made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) separate engagements, it was not without difficulty, without considerable address at times , that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) could get away, or introduce an acquaintance for a night.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken at its best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had persuaded his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aunt where his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uncle could do nothing, and on her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) laughing and noticing it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) owned that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed -LRB-excepting one or two points-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could with time persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to any thing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had wanted very much to go abroad--had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel--but she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) would not hear of it.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) importance at Enscombe was very evident. One of those points on which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) influence failed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then mentioned. This had happened the year before.
<p/>Now , he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was beginning to have no longer the same wish. The unpersuadable point, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not mention, Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father.
<p/>I have made a most wretched discovery,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), after a short pause.-- <div class="bookquote">``I have been here a week to-morrow--half my time.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I never knew days fly so fast. A week to-morrow!--And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself. But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others!--I hate the recollection.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out of so few, in having your hair cut.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' No,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), smiling, <div class="bookquote">``that is no subject of regret at all. I have no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to be seen.
<p/>The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself obliged to turn from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole.
<p/>When Mr. Cole had moved away, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attention could be restored as before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.
<p/>I believe I have been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hair in so odd a way--so very odd a way--that I cannot keep my eyes from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' What is the matter?'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) started. '' Thank you for rousing me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) replied. '' I never saw any thing so outree!--Those
<p/>curls!--This must be a fancy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own. I see nobody else looking like her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)!--I must go and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) whether it is an Irish fashion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) standing before Miss Fairfax, and talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); but as to its effect on the young lady, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly in front of Miss Fairfax, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could absolutely distinguish nothing.
<p/>Shall I?--Yes , I will--I declare I will--and you shall see how she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) takes it;--whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) colours. '' Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.
<p/>'' This is the luxury of a large party,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>):--<div class="bookquote">``one can get near every body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to talk to you.
<p/>I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh.
<p/>Do you know how Miss Bates and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece came here?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How?--They were invited, were not they?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! yes--but how they were conveyed hither?--the manner of their coming?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true.--Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, and cold as the nights are now.
<p/>And as I looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), though I never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) appear to more advantage, it struck me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was heated, and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold.
<p/>I could not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room, and I could get at him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), I spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) about the carriage.
<p/>You may guess how readily he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) came into my wishes; and having his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) approbation, I made my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) that the carriage would be at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) service before it took us home;
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?'' Poor girl! for I thought it would be making her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) comfortable at once.
<p/>with many, many thanks--`there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley's carriage had brought, and was to take them home again.'
<p/>Good soul! she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was as grateful as possible, you may be sure. ' Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'--but I was quite surprized;--very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized.
<p/>And, in short, from knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) usual ways, I am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation
<p/>Such a very kind attention--and so thoughtful an attention!--the sort of thing that so few men would think of. the carriage was used at all.
<p/>I do suspect he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would not have had a pair of horses for himself, and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them.''
<p/>I know no man more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing--to do any thing really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is not a gallant man, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane Fairfax's ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>);--and for an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley.
<p/>I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had horses to-day--for we arrived together; and I laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) about it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) said not a word that could betray.
<p/>Well,'' said Mrs. Weston, smiling, ``you give him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) credit for more simple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while Miss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have never been able to get it out again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma--<div class="bookquote">``nothing more likely. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' The more I think of it, the more probable it appears. In short, I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax.
<p/>See the consequence of keeping you company!--What do you say to it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Emma. '' Dear Mrs. Weston, how could you think of such a thing?--Mr. Knightley!--Mr.
<p/>Knightley must not marry!--You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell?--Oh! no, no, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at all consent to Mr. Knightley's marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely.
<p/>I am amazed that you should think of such a thing.'' '' My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it.
<p/>I do not want the match--I do not want to injure dear little Henry--but the idea has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to marry, you would not have him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) refrain on Henry's account, a boy of six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted.--Mr. Knightley marry!--No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adopt it now.
<p/>And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) has always been a first favourite with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), as you very well know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But the imprudence of such a match! '' <div class="bookquote">``I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than what you mention.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) has a great regard for the Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax--and is always glad to shew them attention.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) good-nature, his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) humanity, as I tell you, would be quite enough to account for the horses. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to match-making.
<p/>You do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey!--Oh! no, no;--every feeling revolts. For his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own sake, I would not have him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) do so mad a thing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Imprudent, if you please--but not mad. Excepting inequality of fortune, and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) has not the least idea of it. Do not put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) head.
<p/>Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) marry?--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is as happy as possible by himself; with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) farm, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) sheep, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) library, and all the parish to manage; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is extremely fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) brother's children.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) has no occasion to marry, either to fill up his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) time or his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) heart.'' '' My dear Emma, as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) thinks so, it is so; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) really loves Jane Fairfax--
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love, I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) does not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would do any good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), or her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) family; but--''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Jane Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/>Well,'' said Mrs. Weston, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``perhaps the greatest good he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>If it would be good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), I am sure it would be evil to himself; a very shameful and degrading connexion.
<p/>have her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) haunting the Abbey, and thanking him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) all day long for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) great kindness in marrying Jane?--`So very kind and obliging!--But
<p/>'' '' How would he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)?--To he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) always had been such a very kind neighbour!'
<p/>Not that it was such a very old petticoat either--for still it would last a great while--and, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong.'''
<p/>And then fly off, through half a sentence, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) mother's old petticoat. ' <div class="bookquote">``For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/>You divert me against my conscience. And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss Bates.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) might talk on; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wanted to say any thing himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would only talk louder, and drown her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) voice.
<p/>But the question is not, whether it would be a bad connexion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), but whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wishes it; and I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) does.
<p/>Little things do not irritate him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) speak, and so must you, so very highly of Jane Fairfax!
<p/>I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) express himself so warmly on those points!--Such an admirer of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) performance on the pianoforte, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) voice!
<p/>The interest he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) takes in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)--his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) anxiety about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) health--his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) concern that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) should have no happier prospect! I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) for ever.
<p/>and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me--this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody--though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley?
<p/>Oh! I cannot help suspecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is just the person to do it, even without being in love.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>``Then it can be no argument to prove that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is in love. But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to do.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) lamenting her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) having no instrument repeatedly; oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common course of things, occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).
<p/>Mr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' '' Very well; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had intended to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) so.''
<p/>``There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have a very strong notion that it comes from him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was particularly silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have many a time reproached me with doing.
<p/>I see no sign of attachment--I believe nothing of the pianoforte--and proof only shall convince me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax.
<p/>They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend; for Mrs. Weston was the most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation;--and at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it.
<p/>Frank Churchill, of whom, in the eagerness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) conversation with Mrs. Weston, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had been seeing nothing, except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr. Cole, to add his (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) very pressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it suited Emma best to lead, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave a very proper compliance.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew the limitations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own powers too well to attempt more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could perform with credit; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable, and could accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own voice well.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>'' One accompaniment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) song took her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) agreeably by surprize--a second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pardon was duly begged at the close of the song, and every thing usual followed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was accused of having a delightful voice, and a perfect knowledge of music; which was properly denied; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) knew nothing of the matter, and had no voice at all, roundly asserted.
<p/>They sang together once more; and Emma would then resign her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) place to Miss Fairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) never could attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own.
<p/>With mixed feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sang again.
<p/>But the sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half Emma's mind; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions.
<p/>They had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) objections to Mr. Knightley's marrying did not in the least subside.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could see nothing but evil in it. It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John Knightley; consequently to Isabella.
<p/>A real injury to the children--a most mortifying change, and material loss to them all;--a very great deduction from her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) father's daily comfort--and, as to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) could not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey.
<p/>A Mrs. Knightley for them all to give way to!--No--Mr. Knightley must never marry. Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.
<p/>Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). They talked at first only of the performance. His (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) admiration was certainly very warm; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not have struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).
<p/>As a sort of touchstone, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) began to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) believed it to indicate only his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own.
<p/>It is not that I am without the wish; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put-to for such a purpose.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) replied;--<div class="bookquote">``but you must often wish it, I am sure.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I often feel concern,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that I dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must proceed another step.
<p/>'' This present from the Campbells,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)--<div class="bookquote">``this pianoforte is very kindly given.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) replied, and without the smallest apparent
<p/>embarrassment.--<div class="bookquote">``But they would have done better had they given her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) notice of it. Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure is not enhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable.
<p/>I should have expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>From that moment, Emma could have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) oath that Mr. Knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument.
<p/>But whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were entirely free from peculiar attachment--whether there were no actual preference--remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end of Jane's second song, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) voice grew thick.
<p/>'' That will do,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), when it was finished, thinking aloud--<div class="bookquote">``you have sung quite enough for one evening--now be quiet.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Another song, however, was soon begged for. '' One more;--they would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more.
<p/>And Frank Churchill was heard to say, <div class="bookquote">``I think you could manage this without effort; the first part is so very trifling.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>The strength of the song falls on the second. '' Mr. Knightley grew angry. '' That fellow,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), indignantly, ``thinks of nothing but shewing off his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own voice.
<p/>And touching Miss Bates, who at that moment passed near--<div class="bookquote">``Miss Bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner?
<p/>Miss Bates, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even to be grateful, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) stept forward and put an end to all farther singing.
<p/>Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but soon -LRB-within five minutes-RRB- the proposal of dancing--originating nobody exactly knew where--was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space.
<p/>Mrs. Weston, capital in her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) country-dances, was seated, and beginning an irresistible waltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma, had secured her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand, and led her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) up to the top.
<p/>While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off, Emma found time, in spite of the compliments she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was receiving on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) voice and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr. Knightley.
<p/>This must not be. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>Go, and interfere. They have no mercy on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).'' This would be a trial. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was no dancer in general.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur something. There was no immediate appearance.
<p/>No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was talking to Mrs. Cole--he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was still talking to Mrs. Cole.
<p/>Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) interest was yet safe; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment.
<p/>Not more than five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found herself well matched in a partner.
<p/>They were a couple worth looking at. Two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. It was growing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) mother's account.
<p/>After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to begin again, they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful, and have done.
<p/>'' Perhaps it is as well,'' said Frank Churchill, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) attended Emma to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) carriage. '' I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) languid dancing would not have agreed with me, after yours.''
<p/>The visit afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must have delighted the Coles--worthy people, who deserved to be made happy!--And left a name behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that would not soon die away.
<p/>CHAPTER IX Emma did not repent her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) condescension in going to the Coles. Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two points on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not quite easy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) doubted whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) suspicions of Jane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill.
<p/>It was hardly right; but it had been so strong an idea, that it would escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) submission to all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) told, was a compliment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) penetration, which made it difficult for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be quite certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ought to have held her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tongue.
<p/>The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had no doubt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) own playing and singing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) childhood--and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet's praise could have satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might soon have been comforted.
<p/>'' Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)'s, than a lamp is like sunshine.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! dear --I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quite as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) does.
<p/>I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body last night said how well you played. '' '' Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference.
<p/>The truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised, but Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it.
<p/>Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) does, or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out.
<p/>Mr. Cole said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) valued taste much more than execution.
<p/>'' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure? I saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had execution, but I did not know she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had any taste.
<p/>Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing.--There is no understanding a word of it. Besides, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) does play so very well
<p/>, you know, it is no more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) is obliged to do, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) will have to teach. The Coxes were wondering last night whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) would get into any great family.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), though fearful of its producing Mr. Elton. '' They told me--that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) came to their father upon some business, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to stay to dinner.'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' They talked a great deal about him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), especially Anne Cox.
<p/>I do not know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) meant, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer.''
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox should be.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) sat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at dinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very likely.--I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar girls in Highbury. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>Harriet had business at Ford's.--Emma thought it most prudent to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/>Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always very long at a purchase; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was still hanging over muslins and changing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mind, Emma went to the door for amusement.--Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury;--Mr.
<p/>Perry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the office-door, Mr. Cole's carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could presume to expect; and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes fell only on the butcher with his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) full basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling children round the baker's little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no reason to complain, and was amused enough; quite enough still to stand at the door.
<p/>Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) present state, would be dangerous. A mind lively and at ease, can do with seeing nothing, and can see nothing that does not answer.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two persons appeared; Mrs. Weston and her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son-in-law; they were walking into Highbury;--to Hartfield of course.
<p/>They were stopping, however, in the first place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was a little nearer Randalls than Ford's; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught their eye.--Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and the agreeableness of yesterday's engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting.
<p/>Mrs. Weston informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was going to call on the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument. ''
<p/>For my companion tells me,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night, that I would come this morning.
<p/>I was not aware of it myself. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) says I did, I am going now.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And while Mrs. Weston pays her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) visit, I may be allowed, I hope,'' said Frank Churchill, <div class="bookquote">``to join your party and wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) at Hartfield--if you are going home.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>'' Mrs. Weston was disappointed. '' I thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much pleased.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps--I may be equally in the way here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) did not want me.
<p/>My aunt always sends me off when she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is shopping. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) says I fidget her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to death; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could almost say the same.
<p/>What am I to do? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am here on no business of my own,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma; ``I am only waiting for my friend.

<p/>Well--if you advise it.--But -LRB-with a smile-RRB- if Colonel Campbell should have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone--what shall I say?
<p/>A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) lips, but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not believe any such thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Emma.--<div class="bookquote">``I am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I shall be no support to Mrs. Weston. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might do very well by herself. '' Quite otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's opinion last night.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do come with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston, <div class="bookquote">``if it be not very disagreeable to you. It need not detain us long.
<p/>We will go to Hartfield afterwards. We will follow them to Hartfield. I really wish you to call with me. It will be felt so great an attention!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates's door.
<p/>Emma watched them in, and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter,--trying, with all the force of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own mind, to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be it ever so beautiful, would still never match her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) yellow pattern.
<p/>and I always thought you meant it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>At last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.
<p/>'' Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am? '' asked Mrs. Ford.--<div class="bookquote">``Yes--no--yes, to Mrs. Goddard's. Only my pattern gown is at Hartfield.
<p/>No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please. But then, Mrs. Goddard will want to see it.--And I could take the pattern gown home any day.
<p/>But I shall want the ribbon directly--so it had better go to Hartfield--at least the ribbon. You could make it into two parcels, Mrs. Ford, could not you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two parcels.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No more it is. ''
<p/>'' No trouble in the world, ma'am,'' said the obliging Mrs. Ford. '' Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one.
<p/>No, I think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield, and take it home with me at night.
<p/>Then, if you please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's--I do not know-- What do you advise?'' ``That you do not give another half-second to the subject.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, that will be much best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>said Harriet, quite satisfied, <div class="bookquote">``I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard's.
<p/>To Hartfield, if you please, Mrs. Ford. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>'' Voices approached the shop--or rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs. Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door.
<p/>My dear Miss Woodhouse,'' said the latter, <div class="bookquote">``I am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while, and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>How do you do, Miss Smith?--Very well I thank you.--And I begged Mrs. Weston to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>``Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well; and Jane caught no cold last night.
<p/>How is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad to hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here.--Oh! then, said I,
<p/>I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to come in; my mother will be so very happy to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)--and now we are such a nice party, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cannot refuse.--`Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank Churchill, `Miss Woodhouse's opinion of the instrument will be worth having.'--But, said I, I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me.--`Oh,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), `wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;'--For
<p/>, would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is, in the most obliging manner in the world, fastening in the rivet of my mother's spectacles.--The rivet came out, you know,
<p/>this morning.--So very obliging!--For my mother had no use of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spectacles--could not put them on. And, by the bye, every body ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed.
<p/>I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did, but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing, then another, there is no saying
<p/>Jane said so. what, you know. At one time Patty came to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Patty</b></font>) thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh, said I, Patty do not come with your bad news to me.
<p/>Then the baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallis sent them by her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) boy; they are extremely civil and obliging to us, the Wallises, always--I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them.
<p/>Here is the rivet of your mistress's spectacles out. And it cannot be for the value of our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread, you know?
<p/>Only three of us.--besides dear Jane at present--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) really eats nothing--makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened if you saw it.
<p/>I dare not let my mother know how little she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eats--so I say one thing and then I say another, and it passes off.
<p/>But about the middle of the day she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gets hungry, and there is nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) likes so well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome, for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry
<p/>; I happened to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) in the street. Not that I had any doubt before--I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple.
<p/>I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome. We have apple-dumplings, however, very often.
<p/>Emma would be <div class="bookquote">``very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>and they did at last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Bates than, <div class="bookquote">``How do you do, Mrs. Ford?
<p/>Patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these ladies will oblige us. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>I beg your pardon.
<p/>I did not see you before. I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. Jane came back delighted yesterday.
<p/>Thank ye, the gloves do very well--only a little too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking them in.'' ''
<p/>What was I talking of?'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), beginning again when they were all in the street. Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would fix.
<p/>'' I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of.--Oh! my mother's spectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! '
<p/>Oh!' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), 'I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind excessively.'--Which you know shewed him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to be so very....
<p/>Indeed I must say that, much as I had heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) before and much as I had expected, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) very far exceeds any thing....
<p/>I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston, most warmly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) seems every thing the fondest parent could... ' Oh!' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), 'I can fasten the rivet.
<p/>And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some, `Oh!' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) directly, `there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.'
<p/>I like a job of that sort excessively.' I never shall forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) manner. That, you know, was so very.... And I am sure, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) manner, it was no compliment.
<p/>Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice--only we do not have them baked more than twice, and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times--but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it.
<p/>The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwell--some of Mr. Knightley's most liberal supply.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) sends us a sack every year; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) trees--I believe there is two of them.
<p/>But I was really quite shocked the other day--for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating these apples, and we talked about them and said how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) enjoyed them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock. '
<p/>I am sure you must be,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), `and I will send you another supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever use.
<p/>My mother says the orchard was always famous in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) younger days. William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year.
<p/>So I begged he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) would not--for really as to ours being gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left--it was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could not at all bear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) should be sending us more
<p/>I will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.' , so liberal as he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) had been already; and Jane said the same.
<p/>No, I should not say quarrelled, for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) was gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) almost quarrelled with me-- ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) wished I had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) believe we had a great many left.
<p/>However, the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged, and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing, as you may suppose.
<p/>Oh, said I, my dear, I did say as much as I could. William Larkins is such an old acquaintance! I am always glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>).
<p/>But, however, I found afterwards from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of that sort his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) master had; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had brought them all--and now his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) master had not one left to bake or boil.
<p/>William did not seem to mind it himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was so pleased to think his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) master had sold so many; for William, you know, thinks more of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) master's profit than any thing; but Mrs. Hodges, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, was quite displeased at their being all sent away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) told Patty this, but bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Patty</b></font>) not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for Mrs. Hodges would be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks were sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hodges</b></font>) could not bear that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hodges</b></font>) master should not be able to have another apple-tart this spring. And so Patty told me, and I was excessively shocked indeed!
<p/>I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for the world! He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would be so very.... I wanted to keep it from Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it before I was aware.
<p/>Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Patty</b></font>) visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to, pursued only by the sounds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Patty</b></font>) desultory good-will.
<p/>'' '' Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. Pray take care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase--rather darker and narrower than one could wish.
<p/>Miss Smith, pray take care. Miss Woodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot. Miss Smith, the step at the turning.
<p/>The appearance of the little sitting-room as they entered, was tranquillity itself; Mrs. Bates, deprived of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) usual employment, slumbering on one side of the fire, Frank Churchill, at a table near her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), most deedily occupied about her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) spectacles, and Jane Fairfax, standing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) back to them, intent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) pianoforte.
<p/>Busy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again.
<p/>This is a pleasure,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in rather a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``coming at least ten minutes earlier than I had calculated.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER X '' You find me trying to be useful; tell me if you think I shall succeed. '' <div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston, ``have not you finished it yet?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have not been working uninterruptedly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``I have been assisting Miss Fairfax in trying to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) instrument stand steadily, it was not quite firm; an unevenness in the floor, I believe.
<p/>you would not earn a very good livelihood as a working silversmith at this rate. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>You see we have been wedging one leg with paper.
<p/>This was very kind of you to be persuaded to come. I was almost afraid you would be hurrying home. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) contrived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should be seated by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and was sufficiently employed in looking out the best baked apple for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), and trying to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) help or advise him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work, till Jane Fairfax was quite ready to sit down to the pianoforte again.
<p/>That she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was not immediately ready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nerves; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must reason herself into the power of performance; and Emma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and could not but resolve never to expose them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) neighbour again.
<p/>At last Jane began, and though the first bars were feebly given, the powers of the instrument were gradually done full justice to.
<p/>Mrs. Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.
<p/>I heard a good deal of Colonel Campbell's taste at Weymouth; and the softness of the upper notes I am sure is exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) and all that party would particularly prize.
<p/>'' Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ,'' said Frank Churchill, with a smile at Emma, <div class="bookquote">``the person has not chosen ill. I dare say, Miss Fairfax, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) either gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) friend very minute directions, or wrote to Broadwood himself.
<p/>Do not you think so? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>Jane did not look round. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was not obliged to hear. Mrs. Weston had been speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) at the same moment.
<p/>'' It is not fair,'' said Emma, in a whisper; <div class="bookquote">``mine was a random guess. Do not distress her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) head with a smile, and looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had very little doubt and very little mercy.
<p/>Soon afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) began again, ``How much your friends in Ireland must be enjoying your pleasure on this occasion, Miss Fairfax.
<p/>I dare say they often think of you, and wonder which will be the day, the precise day of the instrument's coming to hand.
<p/>you imagine it to be the consequence of an immediate commission from him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) may have sent only a general direction, an order indefinite as to time, to depend upon contingencies and conveniences?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) could not but hear; she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) could not avoid answering, <div class="bookquote">``Till I have a letter from Colonel Campbell,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>), in a voice of forced calmness, <div class="bookquote">``I can imagine nothing with any confidence.
<p/>Do you imagine Colonel Campbell knows the business to be going forward just at this time?--Do ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) paused. It must be all conjecture.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Conjecture--aye, sometimes one conjectures right, and sometimes one conjectures wrong. I wish I could conjecture how soon I shall make this rivet quite firm.
<p/>What nonsense one talks, Miss Woodhouse, when hard at work, if one talks at all;--your real workmen, I suppose, hold their tongues; but we gentlemen labourers if we get hold of a word--Miss Fairfax said something about conjecturing.
<p/>There, it is done. I have the pleasure, madam, -LRB-to Mrs. Bates,-RRB- of restoring your spectacles, healed for the present. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was very warmly thanked both by mother and daughter; to escape a little from the latter, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) went to the pianoforte, and begged Miss Fairfax, who was still sitting at it, to play something more.
<p/>'' If you are very kind,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it will be one of the waltzes we danced last night;--let me live them over again.
<p/>I believe you were glad we danced no longer; but I would have given worlds--all the worlds one ever has to give--for another half-hour.
<p/>You did not enjoy them as I did; you appeared tired the whole time. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) played. '' What felicity it is to hear a tune again which has made one happy!--If
<p/>I mistake not that was danced at Weymouth. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) for a moment, coloured deeply, and played something else.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) took some music from a chair near the pianoforte, and turning to Emma, said, ``Here is something quite new to me.
<p/>Do you know it?--Cramer.--And here are a new set of Irish melodies. That, from such a quarter, one might expect. This was all sent with the instrument.
<p/>Very thoughtful of Colonel Campbell, was not it?--He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) knew Miss Fairfax could have no music here. I honour that part of the attention particularly; it shews it to have been so thoroughly from the heart.
<p/>Emma wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) would be less pointed, yet could not help being amused; and when on glancing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eye towards Jane Fairfax she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) caught the remains of a smile, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness, there had been a smile of secret delight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had less scruple in the amusement, and much less compunction with respect to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>).--This amiable, upright, perfect Jane Fairfax was apparently cherishing very reprehensible feelings.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) brought all the music to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), and they looked it over together.--Emma took the opportunity of whispering, <div class="bookquote">``You speak too plain.

<p/>Leave shame to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) does wrong, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ought to feel it.''

<p/>I will not open the window here; it would give you all cold; but I can go into my mother's room you know.
<p/>'' Mr. Knightley I declare!--I must speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) if possible, just to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) will come in when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) knows who is here.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was in the adjoining chamber while she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) still spoke, and opening the casement there, immediately called Mr. Knightley's attention, and every syllable of their conversation was as distinctly heard by the others, as if it had passed within the same apartment.
<p/>Quite delightful to have you all meet so!--Our little room so honoured! '' '' How d' ye do?--how d'ye do?--Very well, I thank you.
<p/>So obliged to you for the carriage last night. We were just in time; my mother just ready for us. Pray come in; do come in.
<p/>You will find some friends here. '' So began Miss Bates; and Mr. Knightley seemed determined to be heard in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) turn, for most resolutely and commandingly
<p/>did he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) say, <div class="bookquote">``How is your niece, Miss Bates?--I want to inquire after you all, but particularly your niece. How is Miss Fairfax?--I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) caught no cold last night.
<p/>How is she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) to-day? Tell me how Miss Fairfax is. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And Miss Bates was obliged to give a direct answer before he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) in any thing else.
<p/>The listeners were amused; and Mrs. Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning. But Emma still shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head in steady scepticism.
<p/>'' So obliged to you!--so very much obliged to you for the carriage,'' resumed Miss Bates. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) short with, <div class="bookquote">``I am going to Kingston.
<p/>Can I do any thing for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! dear, Kingston--are you?--Mrs. Cole was saying the other day she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) wanted something from Kingston.
<p/>'' '' Mrs. Cole has servants to send. Can I do any thing for you ?'' '' No, I thank you.
<p/>But do come in. Who do you think is here?--Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith; so kind as to call to hear the new pianoforte.
<p/>Do put up your horse at the Crown, and come in.'' '' Well,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>), in a deliberating manner, <div class="bookquote">``for five minutes, perhaps.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And here is Mrs. Weston and Mr. Frank Churchill too!--Quite delightful; so many friends!'' '' No, not now, I thank you.
<p/>I could not stay two minutes. I must get on to Kingston as fast as I can.'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh! do come in.
<p/>They will be so very happy to see you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No, no; your room is full enough. I will call another day, and hear the pianoforte.''
<p/>'' Well, I am so sorry!--Oh! Mr. Knightley, what a delightful party last night; how extremely pleasant.--Did you ever see such dancing?--Was not
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! very delightful indeed; I can say nothing less, for I suppose Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill are hearing every thing that passes.
<p/>it delightful?--Miss Woodhouse and Mr. Frank Churchill ; I never saw any thing equal to it.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And -LRB-raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) voice still more-RRB-
<p/>I do not see why Miss Fairfax should not be mentioned too. I think Miss Fairfax dances very well; and Mrs. Weston is the very best country-dance player, without exception, in England.
<p/>Now, if your friends have any gratitude, they will say something pretty loud about you and me in return; but I cannot stay to hear it.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Mr. Knightley, one moment more; something of consequence--so shocked!--Jane and I are both so shocked about the apples!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What is the matter now?''
<p/>'' To think of your sending us all your store apples. You said you had a great many, and now you have not one left.
<p/>We really are so shocked! Mrs. Hodges may well be angry. William Larkins mentioned it here. You should not have done it, indeed you should not.
<p/>Ah! he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) is off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) never can bear to be thanked. But I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) would have staid now, and it would have been a pity not to have mentioned....
<p/>Well, -LRB-returning to the room,-RRB- I have not been able to succeed. Mr. Knightley cannot stop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is going to Kingston.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) asked me if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could do any thing...'' '' Yes,'' said Jane, <div class="bookquote">``we heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) kind offers, we heard every thing.
<p/>yes, my dear, I dare say you might, because you know, the door was open, and the window was open, and Mr. Knightley spoke loud.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Jane Fairfax</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! You must have heard every thing to be sure. ' Can I do any thing for you at Kingston?'
<p/>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); so I just mentioned.... Oh! Miss Woodhouse, must you be going?--You seem but just come-- so very obliging of you.
<p/>Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived to be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) companion taking leave also, could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield gates, before they set off for Randalls.
<p/>Instances have been known of young people passing many, many months successively, without being at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrue either to body or mind;--but when a beginning is made--when the felicities of rapid motion have once been,
<p/>'' CHAPTER XI It may be possible to do without dancing entirely. though slightly, felt--it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.
<p/>Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again; and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject.
<p/>Frank's was the first idea; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance.
<p/>But still she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced--for doing that in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) need not blush to compare herself with Jane Fairfax--and even for simple dancing itself, without any of the wicked aids of vanity--to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold--and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, in spite of all that Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size, that it was a little the largest.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole's should be finished there--that the same party should be collected, and the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence.
<p/>Mr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance; and the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly who there would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple.
<p/>You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five,'' had been repeated many times over.
<p/>'' '' And there will be the two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr. Knightley. Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure.
<p/>You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five; and for five couple there will be plenty of room.
<p/>'' But soon it came to be on one side, <div class="bookquote">``But will there be good room for five couple?--I really do not think there will.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>On another, <div class="bookquote">``And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it.
<p/>It will not do to invite five couple. It can be allowable only as the thought of the moment. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Somebody</b></font>)</div>Somebody said that Miss Gilbert was expected at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) brother's, and must be invited with the rest.
<p/>A word was put in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included, and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out, it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten, and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of.
<p/>Somebody else believed Mrs . Gilbert would have danced the other evening, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) had been asked. The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other.
<p/>'' Might not they use both rooms, and dance across the passage? '' It seemed the best scheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better.
<p/>Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distress about the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score of health.
<p/>It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be persevered in. '' Oh! no,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``it would be the extreme of imprudence.
<p/>I could not bear it for Emma!--Emma is not strong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would catch a dreadful cold. So would poor little Harriet.
<p/>So you would all. Mrs. Weston, you would be quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing.
<p/>Pray do not let them talk of it. That young man -LRB-speaking lower-RRB- is very thoughtless. Do not tell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, but that young man is not quite the thing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been opening the doors very often this evening, and keeping them open very inconsiderately. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not think of the draught.
<p/>I do not mean to set you against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not quite the thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge.
<p/>Every door was now closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will on Frank Churchill's part, that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) knew the importance of it, and said every thing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) power to do it away. '' We were too magnificent,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>).
<p/>'' We allowed unnecessary room. Ten couple may stand here very well. '' Emma demurred. '' It would be a crowd--a sad crowd; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in?''
<p/>But still he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) went on measuring, and still he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) ended with, <div class="bookquote">``I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) gravely replied; <div class="bookquote">``it was very bad. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you are quite unreasonable. It would be dreadful to be standing so close!
<p/>Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd--and a crowd in a little room!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' There is no denying it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) replied.
<p/>'' I agree with you exactly. A crowd in a little room--Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving pictures in a few words.
<p/>Exquisite, quite exquisite!--Still, however, having proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. It would be a disappointment to my father--and altogether--I do not know that
<p/>Emma perceived that the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gallantry was a little self-willed, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) took the compliment, and forgave the rest.
<p/>Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) intended ever to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), it might have been worth while to pause and consider, and try to understand the value of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) preference, and the character of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) temper; but for all the purposes of their acquaintance, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was quite amiable enough.
<p/>Before the middle of the next day, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was at Hartfield; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme.
<p/>--I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well. '' It soon appeared that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came to announce an improvement.
<p/>Well, Miss Woodhouse,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) almost immediately began, <div class="bookquote">``your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the terrors of my father's little rooms.
<p/>I bring a new proposal on the subject:--a thought of my father's, which waits only your approbation to be acted upon.
<p/>May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the Crown Inn?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot, my father hopes his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friends will be so kind as to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) there.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``The Crown!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Better accommodations, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can promise them, and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls. It is his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own idea.
<p/>Mrs. Weston sees no objection to it, provided you are satisfied. This is what we all feel. Oh! you were perfectly right!
<p/>Ten couple, in either of the Randalls rooms, would have been insufferable!--Dreadful!--I felt how right you were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing any thing to like to yield.
<p/>Is not it a good exchange?--You consent--I hope you consent?'' <div class="bookquote">``It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs. Weston do not.
<p/>I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer for myself, shall be most happy-- It seems the only improvement that could be.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully comprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable.
<p/>Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) thought it very far from an improvement--a very bad plan--much worse than the other.
<p/>A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous; never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they must dance, they had better dance at Randalls.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) had never been in the room at the Crown in his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) life--did not know the people who kept it by sight.--Oh!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was going to observe, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said Frank Churchill, <div class="bookquote">``that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body's catching cold--so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls!
<p/>no--a very bad plan. They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere.''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but nobody else could.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, <div class="bookquote">``you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character.
<p/>Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father's house.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all--not once the whole evening; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon heated bodies, which -LRB-as you well know, sir-RRB- does the mischief.''
<p/>``From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. <div class="bookquote">``Open the windows!--but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls.
<p/>Nobody could be so imprudent! I never heard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows!--I am sure, neither your father nor Mrs. Weston -LRB-poor Miss Taylor that was-RRB- would suffer it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! sir--but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected.
<p/>I have often known it done myself.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Have you indeed, sir?--Bless me! I never could have supposed it. But I live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear.
<p/>However, this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it over--but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration.
<p/>If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what can be done.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry. '' But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>interrupted Emma, <div class="bookquote">``there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over.
<p/>There is no hurry at all. If it can be contrived to be at the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses.
<p/>They will be so near their own stable.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James ever complains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can.
<p/>If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired--but is Mrs. Stokes to be trusted? I doubt it. I do not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Stokes</b></font>), even by sight.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be under Mrs. Weston's care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>papa</b></font>)</div>'' There, papa!--Now you must be satisfied--Our own dear Mrs. Weston, who is carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so many years ago, when I had the measles? '
<p/>If Miss Taylor undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.' How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>)!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poor little Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would have been very bad, but for Perry's great attention.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) said, from the first, it was a very good sort--which was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful complaint.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) came four times a day for a week. I hope whenever poor Isabella's little ones have the measles, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) will send for Perry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said Frank Churchill, <div class="bookquote">``examining the capabilities of the house.
<p/>I left them there and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot.
<p/>I was desired to say so from both. It would be the greatest pleasure to them, if you could allow me to attend you there.
<p/>Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, engaging to think it all over while she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was gone, the two young people set off together without delay for the Crown.
<p/>There were Mr. and Mrs. Weston; delighted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) and receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) approbation, very busy and very happy in their different way; she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), in some little distress; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), finding every thing perfect.
<p/>in places you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined.
<p/>They can do nothing satisfactorily without you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Emma,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``this paper is worse than I expected. Look! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>My dear, you are too particular,'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband. '' What does all that signify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight.
<p/>The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, <div class="bookquote">``Men never know when things are dirty or not;''  (<font color='red'><b>The ladies</b></font>)</div>and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself, <div class="bookquote">``Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares.
<p/>It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing of it on our club-nights. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentlemen</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>At the time of the ballroom's being built, suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was the only addition.
<p/>This card-room would be wanted as a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortable supper?
<p/>Another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it.
<p/>One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain. It regarded a supper-room. What was to be done? This made a difficulty.
<p/>Mrs. Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper.
<p/>Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches, &c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion.
<p/>A private dance, without sitting down to supper, was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) then took another line of expediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed, ``I do not think it is so very small.
<p/>And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps through the passage, was calling out, <div class="bookquote">``You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear.
<p/>We shall not be many, you know. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>It is a mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston, <div class="bookquote">``one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best. To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object--if one could but tell what that would be.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, very true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>cried Frank, <div class="bookquote">``very true. You want your neighbours' opinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could ascertain what the chief of them--the Coles, for instance.
<p/>I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body.
<p/>They are not far off. Shall I call upon them? Or Miss Bates? She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is still nearer.--And I think we do want a larger council.
<p/>Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>'' Well--if you please,'' said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, <div class="bookquote">``if you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) will be of any use.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) will be all delight and gratitude, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) will tell you nothing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) will not even listen to your questions. I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates.'' '' But she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is so amusing, so extremely amusing!
<p/>I am very fond of hearing Miss Bates talk. And I need not bring the whole family, you know. '' Here Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave it his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) decided approbation.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties.
<p/>'' Aye, do, Frank.--Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter at once. Fetch Miss Bates. We are growing a little too nice.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is a standing lesson of how to be happy. But fetch them both. Invite them both.'' '' Both sir! Can the old lady?''...
<p/>'' The old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you a great blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece.''
<p/>'' Oh! I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately recollect. Undoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both.
<p/>Weston, like a sweet-tempered woman and a good wife, had examined the passage again, and found the evils of it much less than she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had supposed before--indeed very trifling; and here ended the difficulties of decision.
<p/>'' And away he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) ran. Long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving aunt, and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) elegant niece,--Mrs. All the rest, in speculation at least, was perfectly smooth.
<p/>All the minor arrangements of table and chair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs. Stokes.--Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already written to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) fortnight, which could not possibly be refused.
<p/>And a delightful dance it was to be. Most cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) agree that it must. As a counsellor she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was not wanted; but as an approver, -LRB-a much safer character,-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was truly welcome.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) approbation, at once general and minute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for another half-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the different rooms, some suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment of the future.
<p/>The party did not break up without Emma's being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor without her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) has asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), my dear.
<p/>One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to Emma--its being fixed for a day within the granted term of Frank Churchill's stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr. Weston's confidence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not think it so very impossible that the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) fortnight.
<p/>The preparations must take their time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on, and for a few days they must be planning, proceeding and hoping in uncertainty--at the risk--in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) opinion, the great risk, of its being all in vain.
<p/>That's right. I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) would!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XII But this was not judged feasible. Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word.
<p/>All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley's provoking indifference about it.
<p/>Either because he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) did not dance himself, or because the plan had been formed without his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) being consulted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seemed resolved that it should not interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), determined against its exciting any present curiosity, or affording him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) any future amusement.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not opposed. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply, than, <div class="bookquote">``Very well.
<p/>If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to say against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me.--Oh!
<p/>yes, I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as I can; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins's week's account; much rather, I confess.--Pleasure in seeing
<p/>I, indeed--I never look at it--I do not know who does.--Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward.
<p/>dancing!--not Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>This Emma felt was aimed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quite angry.
<p/>It was not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) was so indifferent, or so indignant; he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) was not guided by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) feelings in reprobating the ball, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree.
<p/>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) animated--open hearted--she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) voluntarily said;-- <div class="bookquote">``Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball. What a disappointment it would be!
<p/>I do look forward to it, I own, with very great pleasure. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) would have preferred the society of William Larkins.
<p/>No!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was more and more convinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise. There was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) side--but no love.
<p/>Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley. Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of every thing.
<p/>Mrs. Churchill was unwell--far too unwell to do without him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been in a very suffering state -LRB-so said her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) husband-RRB- when writing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew two days before, though from her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) usual unwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinking of herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had not mentioned it; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was too ill to trifle, and must entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to set off for Enscombe without delay.
<p/>A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew's instant return. The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note from Mrs. Weston, instantly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) must be gone within a few hours, though without feeling any real alarm for his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) aunt, to lessen his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) repugnance.
<p/>Mrs. Weston added, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends there whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could suppose to feel any interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>); and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) might be expected at Hartfield very soon.
<p/>As to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) going, it was inevitable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) illnesses; they never occurred but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own convenience. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>This wretched note was the finale of Emma's breakfast.
<p/>The loss of the ball--the loss of the young man--and all that the young man might be feeling!--It was too wretched!--Such a delightful evening as it would have been!--Every body so happy!
<p/>When once it had been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim. and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) partner the happiest!--<div class="bookquote">``I said it would be so,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>was the only consolation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought principally of Mrs. Churchill's illness, and wanted to know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was treated; and as for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed; but they would all be safer at home.
<p/>Emma was ready for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) visitor some time before he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) appeared; but if this reflected at all upon his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) impatience, his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) did come might redeem him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's feelings were quite distinct. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) felt the going away almost too much to speak of it. His (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) dejection was most evident.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousing himself, it was only to say, <div class="bookquote">``Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!---LRB-shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) head-RRB---the uncertainty of when I may be able to return!--I shall try for it with a zeal!--It will be the object of all my thoughts and cares!--and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring--but I am afraid--they did not stir last spring--I am afraid it is a custom gone for ever.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But you will come again,'' said Emma. '' This will not be your only visit to Randalls.'' '' Our poor ball must be quite given up.''
<p/>that ball!--why did we wait for any thing?--why not seize the pleasure at once?--How often is happiness destroyed by preparation, foolish preparation!--You told us it would be so.--Oh!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Miss Woodhouse, why are you always so right?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance. I would much rather have been merry than wise.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' If I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My father depends on it. Do not forget your engagement.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) continued; <div class="bookquote">``every day more precious and more delightful than the day before!--every day making me less fit to bear any other place.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Emma looked graciously. '' Such a fortnight as it has been! '' Happy those, who can remain at Highbury!'' ''
<p/>As you do us such ample justice now,'' said Emma, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``I will venture to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first?
<p/>Do not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sure you did not much expect to like us.
<p/>You would not have been so long in coming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emma was convinced that it had been so.
<p/>'' And you must be off this very morning?'' '' Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and I must be off immediately.
<p/>I am almost afraid that every moment will bring him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates?
<p/>How unlucky! Miss Bates's powerful, argumentative mind might have strengthened yours.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Yes--I have called there; passing the door, I thought it better.
<p/>It was a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, and was detained by Miss Bates's being absent.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was out; and I felt it impossible not to wait till she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) came in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is a woman that one may, that one must laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight.
<p/>It was better to pay my visit, then''-- He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hesitated, got up, walked to a window. '' In short,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``perhaps, Miss Woodhouse--I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), as if wanting to read her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) thoughts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) hardly knew what to say. It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) did not wish.
<p/>Forcing herself to speak, therefore, in the hope of putting it by, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) calmly said, <div class="bookquote">``You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit, then'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was silent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>); probably reflecting on what she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had said, and trying to understand the manner.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sigh. It was natural for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had cause to sigh. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could not believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to be encouraging him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>A few awkward moments passed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sat down again; and in a more determined manner said, <div class="bookquote">``It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to Hartfield.
<p/>warm'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-- He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed.--He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was more in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might have ended, if his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) father had not made his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) appearance?
<p/>My regard for Hartfield is most Mr. Woodhouse soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) composed. A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial.
<p/>Mr. Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that was doubtful, said, <div class="bookquote">``It was time to go;''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>and the young man, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.
<p/>'' I shall hear about you all,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); ``that is my chief consolation. I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you.
<p/>I have engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) has been so kind as to promise it. Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one is really interested in the absent!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) will tell me every thing.
<p/>A very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>closed the speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill.
<p/>Short had been the notice--short their meeting; he (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) was gone; and Emma felt so sorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it too much.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) letters I shall be at dear Highbury again. '' It was a sad change. They had been meeting almost every day since his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) arrival.
<p/>Certainly his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) being at Randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks--indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) which every morning had brought, the assurance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) attentions, his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) liveliness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) manners!
<p/>It had been a very happy fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of Hartfield days.
<p/>What strength, or what constancy of affection he (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) might be subject to, was another point; but at present she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) could not doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) having a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious preference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all the rest, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) must be a little in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>), in spite of every previous determination against it.
<p/>To complete every other recommendation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) had almost told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Short</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>). '' I certainly must,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>). ''
<p/>This sensation of listlessness, weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself, this feeling of every thing's being dull and insipid about the house!-- I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were not--for a few weeks at least.
<p/>Well! evil to some is always good to others. I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball, if not for Frank Churchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) may spend the evening with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) dear William Larkins now if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) likes. '' Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was sorry on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own account; his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) very cheerful look would have contradicted him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) said, and very steadily, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with considerable kindness added, <div class="bookquote">``You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really out of luck; you are very much out of luck!
<p/>It was some days before she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) honest regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) composure was odious.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been particularly unwell, however, suffering from headache to a degree, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) aunt declare, that had the ball taken place, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) did not think Jane could have attended it; and it was charity to impute some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill-health.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XIII Emma continued to entertain no doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) being in love. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ideas only varied as to the how much.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had great pleasure in hearing Frank Churchill talked of; and, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) sake, greater pleasure than ever in seeing Mr. and Mrs. Weston; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was very often thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), and quite impatient for a letter, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) might know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was, how were his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) spirits, how was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) aunt, and what was the chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) coming to Randalls again this spring.
<p/>But, on the other hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) could not admit herself to be unhappy, nor, after the first morning, to be less disposed for employment than usual; she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was still busy and cheerful; and, pleasing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) could yet imagine him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to have faults; and farther, though thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) so much, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) sat drawing or working, forming a thousand amusing schemes for the progress and close of their attachment, fancying interesting dialogues, and inventing elegant letters; the conclusion of every imaginary declaration on his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) side was that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) .
<p/>At first, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) thought it was a good deal; and afterwards, but little. Their affection was always to subside into friendship.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) became sensible of this, it struck her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) could not be very much in love; for in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) previous and fixed determination never to quit her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) father, never to marry, a strong attachment certainly must produce more of a struggle than she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) could foresee in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) own feelings.
<p/>I do not find myself making any use of the word sacrifice ,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).--<div class="bookquote">``In not one of all my clever replies, my delicate negatives, is there any allusion to making a sacrifice.
<p/>Every thing tender and charming was to mark their parting; but still they were to part. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I do suspect that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is not really necessary to my happiness.
<p/>So much the better. I certainly will not persuade myself to feel more than I do. I am quite enough in love.
<p/>I should be sorry to be more. '' Upon the whole, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was equally contented with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) view of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feelings.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is undoubtedly very much in love--every thing denotes it--very much in love indeed!--and when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comes again, if his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) affection continue, I must be on my guard not to encourage it.--It would be most inexcusable to do otherwise, as my own mind is quite made up.
<p/>'' Not that I imagine he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can think I have been encouraging him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hitherto. No, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had believed me at all to share his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feelings, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would not have been so wretched.
<p/>Could he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) have thought himself encouraged, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looks and language at parting would have been different.--Still, however, I must be on my guard.
<p/>This is in the supposition of his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) attachment continuing what it now is; but I do not know that I expect it will; I do not look upon him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) to be quite the sort of man--I do not altogether build upon his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) steadiness or constancy.--His (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) feelings are warm, but I can imagine them rather changeable.--Every
<p/>consideration of the subject, in short, makes me thankful that my happiness is not more deeply involved.--I shall do very well again after a little while--and then, it will be a good thing over;
<p/>for they say every body is in love once in their lives, and I shall have been let off easily. ''
<p/>When his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) letter to Mrs. Weston arrived, Emma had the perusal of it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) read it with a degree of pleasure and admiration which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at first shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head over her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own sensations, and think she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had undervalued their strength.
<p/>It was a long, well-written letter, giving the particulars of his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) journey and of his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) feelings, expressing all the affection, gratitude, and respect which was natural and honourable, and describing every thing exterior and local that could be supposed attractive, with spirit and precision.
<p/>; it was the language of real feeling towards Mrs. Weston; and the transition from Highbury to Enscombe, the contrast between the places in some of the first blessings of social life was just enough touched on to shew how keenly it was felt, and how much more might have been said but for the restraints of propriety.--The charm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own name was not wanting.
<p/>Miss Woodhouse appeared more than once, and never without a something of pleasing connexion, either a compliment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) taste, or a remembrance of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had said; and in the very last time of its meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) eye, unadorned as it was by any such broad wreath of gallantry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) yet could discern the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) influence and acknowledge the greatest compliment perhaps of all conveyed.
<p/>Compressed into the very lowest vacant corner were these words--<div class="bookquote">``I had not a spare moment on Tuesday, as you know, for Miss Woodhouse's beautiful little friend.
<p/>No suspicious flourishes now of apology or concern Pray make my excuses and adieus to her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>This, Emma could not doubt, was all for herself.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) information and prospects as to Enscombe were neither worse nor better than had been anticipated; Mrs. Churchill was recovering, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) dared not yet, even in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own imagination, fix a time for coming to Randalls again.
<p/>Harriet was remembered only from being her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend. Gratifying, however, and stimulative as was the letter in the material part, its sentiments
<p/>, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) yet found, when it was folded up and returned to Mrs. Weston, that it had not added any lasting warmth, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could still do without the writer, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) must learn to do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) intentions were unchanged. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) resolution of refusal only grew more interesting by the addition of a scheme for his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) subsequent consolation and happiness.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) recollection of Harriet, and the words which clothed it, the <div class="bookquote">``beautiful little friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>suggested to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) the idea of Harriet's succeeding her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) affections.
<p/>impossible?--No.--Harriet undoubtedly was greatly his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) inferior in understanding; but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been very much struck with the loveliness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) face and the warm simplicity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) manner; and all the probabilities of circumstance and connexion were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) favour.--For Harriet, it would be advantageous and delightful indeed.
<p/>Was it '' I must not dwell upon it,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).--``I must not think of it. I know the danger of indulging such speculations.
<p/>But stranger things have happened; and when we cease to care for each other as we do now, it will be the means of confirming us in that sort of true disinterested friendship which I can already look forward to with pleasure.
<p/>It was well to have a comfort in store on Harriet's behalf, though it might be wise to let the fancy touch it seldom; for evil in that quarter was at hand.
<p/>As Frank Churchill's arrival had succeeded Mr. Elton's engagement in the conversation of Highbury, as the latest interest had entirely borne down the first, so now upon Frank Churchill's disappearance, Mr. Elton's concerns were assuming the most irresistible form.--His (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wedding-day was named.
<p/>There was hardly time to talk over the first letter from Enscombe before <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Elton and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) bride''  (<font color='red'><b>Enscombe</b></font>)</div>was in every body's mouth, and Frank Churchill was forgotten.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had had three weeks of happy exemption from Mr. Elton; and Harriet's mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been willing to hope, had been lately gaining strength.
<p/>With Mr. Weston's ball in view at least, there had been a great deal of insensibility to other things; but it was now too evident that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had not attained such a state of composure as could stand against the actual approach--new carriage, bell-ringing, and all.
<p/>Poor Harriet was in a flutter of spirits which required all the reasonings and soothings and attentions of every kind that Emma could give.
<p/>Emma felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not do too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), that Harriet had a right to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ingenuity and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) patience; but it was heavy work to be for ever convincing without producing any effect, for ever agreed to, without being able to make their opinions the same.
<p/>Harriet listened submissively, and said <div class="bookquote">``it was very true--it was just as Miss Woodhouse described--it was not worth while to think about them--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would not think about them any longer''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>but no change of subject could avail, and the next half-hour saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) as anxious and restless about the Eltons as before.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would soon be among them again; Mr. Elton and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) bride. Emma grew sick at the sound. At last Emma attacked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) on another ground.
<p/>Your allowing yourself to be so occupied and so unhappy about Mr. Elton's marrying, Harriet, is the strongest reproach you can make me .
<p/>'' You could not give me a greater reproof for the mistake I fell into. It was all my doing, I know.
<p/>I have not forgotten it, I assure you.--Deceived myself, I did very miserably deceive you--and it will be a painful reflection to me for ever.
<p/>Do not imagine me in danger of forgetting it. '' Harriet felt this too much to utter more than a few words of eager exclamation.
<p/>Emma continued, <div class="bookquote">``I have not said, exert yourself Harriet for my sake; think less, talk less of Mr. Elton for my sake; because for your own sake rather, I would wish it to be done, for the sake of what is more important than my comfort, a habit of self-command in you, a consideration of what is your duty, an attention to propriety, an endeavour to avoid the suspicions of others, to save your health and credit, and restore your tranquillity.
<p/>These are the motives which I have been pressing on you. They are very important--and sorry I am that you cannot feel them sufficiently to act upon them.
<p/>Perhaps I may sometimes have felt that Harriet would not forget what was due--or rather what would be kind by me.
<p/>My being saved from pain is a very secondary consideration. I want you to save yourself from greater pain. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>This appeal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) affections did more than all the rest.
<p/>The idea of wanting gratitude and consideration for Miss Woodhouse, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) really loved extremely, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) wretched for a while, and when the violence of grief was comforted away, still remained powerful enough to prompt to what was right and support her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) in it very tolerably.
<p/>You, who have been the best friend I ever had in my life--Want gratitude to you!--Nobody is equal to you!--I care for nobody as I do for you!--Oh!
<p/>Such expressions, assisted as they were by every thing that look and manner could do, made Emma feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had never loved Harriet so well, nor valued her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) affection so highly before.
<p/>'' Miss Woodhouse, how ungrateful I have been!'' '' There is no charm equal to tenderness of heart,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) afterwards to herself.
<p/>Warmth and tenderness of heart, with an affectionate, open manner, will beat all the clearness of head in the world, for attraction, I am sure it will.
<p/>It is tenderness of heart which makes my dear father so generally beloved--which gives Isabella all her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) popularity.--I have it not--but I know how to prize and respect
<p/>'' There is nothing to be compared to it. it.--Harriet is my superior in all the charm and all the felicity it gives.
<p/>Dear Harriet!--I would not change you for the clearest-headed, longest-sighted, best-judging female breathing. Oh! the coldness of a Jane Fairfax!--Harriet is worth a hundred such--
<p/>And for a wife--a sensible man's wife--it is invaluable. I mention no names; but happy the man who changes Emma for Harriet!''
<p/>CHAPTER XIV Mrs. Elton was first seen at church: but though devotion might be interrupted, curiosity could not be satisfied by a bride in a pew, and it must be left for the visits in form which were then to be paid, to settle whether she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) were very pretty indeed, or only rather pretty, or not pretty at all.
<p/>Emma had feelings, less of curiosity than of pride or propriety, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) resolve on not being the last to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) respects; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) made a point of Harriet's going with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, to lace up her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) boot, without recollecting .
<p/>Compliments, charades, and horrible blunders; and it was not to be supposed that poor Harriet should not be recollecting too; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) behaved very well, and was only rather pale and silent.
<p/>The visit was of course short; and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it, that Emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady, and on no account to give one, beyond the nothing-meaning terms of being <div class="bookquote">``elegantly dressed, and very pleasing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would not be in a hurry to find fault, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) suspected that there was no elegance;--ease, but not elegance.-- She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was almost sure that for a young woman, a stranger, a bride, there was too much ease.
<p/>A thousand vexatious thoughts would recur. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) did not really like her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) person was rather good; her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) face not unpretty; but neither feature, nor air, nor voice, nor manner, were elegant.
<p/>As for Mr. Elton, his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) manners did not appear--but no, she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) manners.
<p/>It was an awkward ceremony at any time to be receiving wedding visits, and a man had need be all grace to acquit himself well through it.
<p/>The woman was better off; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might have the assistance of fine clothes, and the privilege of bashfulness, but the man had only his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own good sense to depend on; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) considered how peculiarly unlucky poor Mr. Elton was in being in the same room at once with the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had just married, the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had wanted to marry, and the woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had been expected to marry, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to have the right to look as little wise, and to be as much affectedly, and as little really easy as could be.
<p/>Well, Miss Woodhouse,'' said Harriet, when they had quitted the house, and after waiting in vain for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend to begin; <div class="bookquote">``Well, Miss Woodhouse, -LRB-with a gentle sigh,-RRB- what do you think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)?--Is not she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) very charming?
<p/>Emma thought at least it would turn out so. ''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>'' There was a little hesitation in Emma's answer. '' Oh!
<p/>yes--very--a very pleasing young woman. '' <div class="bookquote">``I think her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) beautiful, quite beautiful.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very nicely dressed, indeed; a remarkably elegant gown. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not at all surprized that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should have fallen in love. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh! no--there is nothing to surprize one at all.--A pretty fortune; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) way.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>returned Harriet, sighing again, <div class="bookquote">``I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was very much attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might; but it is not every man's fate to marry the woman who loves him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best.
<p/>Miss Hawkins perhaps wanted a home, and thought this the best offer she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) was likely to have. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>'' Yes,'' said Harriet earnestly, <div class="bookquote">``and well she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might, nobody could ever have a better.
<p/>Well, I wish them happy with all my heart. And now, Miss Woodhouse, I do not think I shall mind seeing them again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is just as superior as ever;--but being married, you know, it is quite a different thing. No, indeed, Miss Woodhouse, you need not be afraid; I can sit and admire him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now without any great misery.
<p/>To know that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not thrown himself away, is such a comfort!--She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) does seem a charming young woman, just what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deserves.
<p/>Happy creature! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) `Augusta.' How delightful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>When the visit was returned, Emma made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could then see more and judge better.
<p/>From Harriet's happening not to be at Hartfield, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father's being present to engage Mr. Elton, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had a quarter of an hour of the lady's conversation to herself, and could composedly attend to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>); and the quarter of an hour quite convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) that Mrs. Elton was a vain woman, extremely well satisfied with herself, and thinking much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own importance; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) meant to shine and be very superior, but with manners which had been formed in a bad school, pert and familiar; that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) notions were drawn from one set of people, and one style of living; that if not foolish she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was ignorant, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) society would certainly do Mr. Elton no good.
<p/>If not wise or refined herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would have connected him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) with those who were; but Miss Hawkins, it might be fairly supposed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) easy conceit, had been the best of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) own set.
<p/>The rich brother-in-law near Bristol was the pride of the alliance, and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) place and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>) carriages were the pride of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>).
<p/>Harriet would have been a better match. The very first subject after being seated was Maple Grove, <div class="bookquote">``My brother Mr. Suckling's seat;'' (<font color='red'><b>Maple Grove</b></font>)</div>--a comparison of Hartfield to Maple Grove.
<p/>Mrs. Elton seemed most favourably impressed by the size of the room, the entrance, and all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) could see or imagine.
<p/>Very like Maple Grove indeed!--She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was quite struck by the likeness!--That room was the very shape and size of the morning-room at Maple Grove; her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) sister's favourite room.''--Mr.
<p/>The grounds of Hartfield were small, but neat and pretty; and the house was modern and well-built. '' Elton was appealed to.--<div class="bookquote">``Was not it astonishingly like?--She (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) could really almost fancy herself at Maple Grove.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And the staircase--You know, as I came in, I observed how very like the staircase was; placed exactly in the same part of the house.
<p/>I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, it is very delightful to me, to be reminded of a place I am so extremely partial to as Maple Grove.
<p/>'' I really could not help exclaiming! I have spent so many happy months there! -LRB-with a little sigh of sentiment-RRB-.
<p/>A charming place, undoubtedly. Every body who sees it is struck by its beauty; but to me, it has been quite a home.
<p/>Whenever you are transplanted, like me, Miss Woodhouse, you will understand how very delightful it is to meet with any thing at all like what one has left behind.
<p/>Emma made as slight a reply as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could; but it was fully sufficient for Mrs. Elton, who only wanted to be talking herself.
<p/>I always say this is quite one of the evils of matrimony. '' '' So extremely like Maple Grove! And it is not merely the house--the grounds, I assure you, as far as I could observe, are strikingly like.
<p/>The laurels at Maple Grove are in the same profusion as here, and stand very much in the same way--just across the lawn; and I had a glimpse of a fine large tree, with a bench round it, which put me so exactly in mind!
<p/>My brother and sister will be enchanted with this place. People who have extensive grounds themselves are always pleased with any thing in the same style.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else; but it was not worth while to attack an error so double-dyed, and therefore only said in reply, <div class="bookquote">``When you have seen more of this country, I am afraid you will think you have overrated Hartfield.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment. Surry is full of beauties. '' '' Oh! yes, I am quite aware of that.
<p/>It is the garden of England, you know. Surry is the garden of England.'' '' Yes; but we must not rest our claims on that distinction.
<p/>Many counties, I believe, are called the garden of England, as well as Surry.'' '' No, I fancy not,'' replied Mrs. Elton, with a most satisfied smile.
<p/>My brother and sister have promised us a visit in the spring, or summer at farthest,'' continued Mrs. Elton; <div class="bookquote">``and that will be our time for exploring.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>I never heard any county but Surry called so. '' Emma was silenced. '' While they are with us, we shall explore a great deal, I dare say.
<p/>They will have their barouche-landau, of course, which holds four perfectly; and therefore, without saying any thing of our carriage, we should be able to explore the different beauties extremely well.
<p/>Indeed, when the time draws on, I shall decidedly recommend their bringing the barouche-landau; it will be so very much preferable.
<p/>When people come into a beautiful country of this sort, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one naturally wishes them to see as much as possible; and Mr. Suckling is extremely fond of exploring.
<p/>They would hardly come in their chaise, I think, at that season of the year. We explored to King's-Weston twice last summer, in that way, most delightfully, just after their first having the barouche-landau.
<p/>We are rather out of distance of the very striking beauties which attract the sort of parties you speak of; and we are a very quiet set of people, I believe; more disposed to stay at home than engage in schemes of pleasure.
<p/>You have many parties of that kind here, I suppose, Miss Woodhouse, every summer?'' '' No; not immediately here. '' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! there is nothing like staying at home for real comfort.
<p/>Many a time has Selina said, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) has been going to Bristol, 'I really cannot get this girl to move from the house.
<p/>I absolutely must go in by myself, though I hate being stuck up in the barouche-landau without a companion; but Augusta, I believe, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own good-will, would never stir beyond the park paling.'
<p/>Nobody can be more devoted to home than I am. I was quite a proverb for it at Maple Grove. Many a time has she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said so; and yet I am no advocate for entire seclusion.
<p/>I think, on the contrary, when people shut themselves up entirely from society, it is a very bad thing; and that it is much more advisable to mix in the world in a proper degree, without living in it either too much or too little.
<p/>I perfectly understand your situation, however, Miss Woodhouse---LRB-looking towards Mr. Woodhouse-RRB-, Your father's state of health must be a great drawback.
<p/>Why does not he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) try Bath?--Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) should. Let me recommend Bath to you. I assure you I have no doubt of its doing Mr. Woodhouse good.''
 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>My father tried it more than once, formerly; but without receiving any benefit; and Mr. Perry, whose name, I dare say, is not unknown to you, does not conceive it would be at all more likely to be useful now.''
<p/>that's a great pity; for I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, where the waters do agree, it is quite wonderful the relief they give.
<p/>And it is so cheerful a place, that it could not fail of being of use to Mr. Woodhouse's spirits, which, I understand, are sometimes much depressed.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! In my Bath life, I have seen such instances of it! And as to its recommendations to you , I fancy I need not take much pains to dwell on them.
<p/>It would be a charming introduction for you, who have lived so secluded a life; and I could immediately secure you some of the best society in the place.
<p/>A line from me would bring you a little host of acquaintance; and my particular friend, Mrs. Partridge, the lady I have always resided with when in Bath, would be most happy to shew you any attentions, and would be the very person for you to go into public with.
<p/>The advantages of Bath to the young are pretty generally understood. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>It was as much as Emma could bear, without being impolite.
<p/>The idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) being indebted to Mrs. Elton for what was called an introduction --of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) going into public under the auspices of a friend of Mrs. Elton's--probably some vulgar, dashing widow, who, with the help of a boarder, just made a shift to live!--The dignity of Miss Woodhouse, of Hartfield, was sunk indeed!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) restrained herself, however, from any of the reproofs she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could have given, and only thanked Mrs. Elton coolly; <div class="bookquote">``but their going to Bath was quite out of the question; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was not perfectly convinced that the place might suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) better than her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) father.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>And then, to prevent farther outrage and indignation, changed the subject directly. '' I do not ask whether you are musical, Mrs. Elton.
<p/>Upon these occasions, a lady's character generally precedes her (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>); and Highbury has long known that you are a superior performer.'' ''
<p/>Oh! no, indeed; I must protest against any such idea. A superior performer!--very far from it, I assure you. Consider from how partial a quarter your information came.
<p/>I am doatingly fond of music--passionately fond;--and my friends say I am not entirely devoid of taste; but as to any thing else, upon my honour my performance is mediocre to the last degree.
<p/>I assure you it has been the greatest satisfaction, comfort, and delight to me, to hear what a musical society I am got into.
<p/>It is a necessary of life to me; and having always been used to a very musical society, both at Maple Grove and in Bath, it would have been a most serious sacrifice.
<p/>I honestly said as much to Mr. E. when he (<font color='blue'><b>E.</b></font>) was speaking of my future home, and expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>E.</b></font>) fears lest the retirement of it should be disagreeable; and the inferiority of the house too--knowing what I had been accustomed to--of course he (<font color='blue'><b>E.</b></font>) was not wholly without apprehension.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>E.</b></font>) was speaking of it in that way, I honestly said that the world I could give up--parties, balls, plays--for I had no fear of retirement.
<p/>You, Miss Woodhouse, I well know, play delightfully. I absolutely cannot do without music. Blessed with so many resources within myself, the world was not necessary to me .
<p/>I could do very well without it. To those who had no resources it was a different thing; but my resources made me quite independent.
<p/>And as to smaller-sized rooms than I had been used to, I really could not give it a thought. I hoped I was perfectly equal to any sacrifice of that description.
<p/>Certainly I had been accustomed to every luxury at Maple Grove; but I did assure him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) that two carriages were not necessary to my happiness, nor were spacious apartments. '
<p/>But,' said I, `to be quite honest, I do not think I can live without something of a musical society. I condition for nothing else; but without music, life would be a blank to me.'
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We cannot suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``that Mr. Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a very musical society in Highbury; and I hope you will not find he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned, in consideration of the motive.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' '' No, indeed, I have no doubts at all on that head. I am delighted to find myself in such a circle.
<p/>I hope we shall have many sweet little concerts together. I think, Miss Woodhouse, you and I must establish a musical club, and have regular weekly meetings at your house, or ours.
<p/>Will not it be a good plan? If we exert ourselves, I think we shall not be long in want of allies.
<p/>Something of that nature would be particularly desirable for me , as an inducement to keep me in practice; for married women, you know--there is a sad story against them, in general.
<p/>They are but too apt to give up music.'' '' But you, who are so extremely fond of it--there can be no danger, surely?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should hope not; but really when I look around among my acquaintance, I tremble. Selina has entirely given up music--never touches the instrument--though she (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) played sweetly.
<p/>And the same may be said of Mrs. Jeffereys--Clara Partridge, that was--and of the two Milmans, now Mrs. Bird and Mrs. James Cooper; and of more than I can enumerate.
<p/>I used to be quite angry with Selina; but really I begin now to comprehend that a married woman has many things to call her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) attention.
<p/>Upon my word it is enough to put one in a fright. I believe I was half an hour this morning shut up with my housekeeper.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But every thing of that kind,'' said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``will soon be in so regular a train--''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' Well,'' said Mrs. Elton, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``we shall see.
<p/>Emma, finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so determined upon neglecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) music, had nothing more to say; and, after a moment's pause, Mrs. Elton chose another subject.
<p/>We have been calling at Randalls,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and found them both at home; and very pleasant people they seem to be.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' I like them extremely. Mr. Weston seems an excellent creature--quite a first-rate favourite with me already, I assure you.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) appears so truly good--there is something so motherly and kind-hearted about her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), that it wins upon one directly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was your governess, I think?
<p/>'' Emma was almost too much astonished to answer; but Mrs. Elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) went on.
<p/>'' Having understood as much, I was rather astonished to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) so very lady-like! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is really quite the gentlewoman.''
<p/>'' Mrs. Weston's manners,'' said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``were always particularly good. Their propriety, simplicity, and elegance, would make them the safest model for any young woman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And who do you think came in while we were there? '' Emma was quite at a loss. The tone implied some old acquaintance--and how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) possibly guess?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Knightley!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Elton; <div class="bookquote">``Knightley himself!--Was not it lucky?--for, not being within when he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) called the other day, I had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) before; and of course, as so particular a friend of Mr. E.'s, I had a great curiosity. '
<p/>My friend Knightley' had been so often mentioned, that I was really impatient to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); and I must do my caro sposo the justice to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) need not be ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) friend.
<p/>Knightley is quite the gentleman. I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) very much. Decidedly, I think, a very gentleman-like man. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>Happily, it was now time to be gone.
<p/>They were off; and Emma could breathe. '' Insufferable woman! '' was her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) immediate exclamation. '' Worse than I had supposed.
<p/>Absolutely insufferable! Knightley!--I could not have believed it. Knightley!--never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life before, and call him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) Knightley!--and discover that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is a gentleman!
<p/>A little upstart, vulgar being, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) Mr. E., and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) caro sposo , and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) resources, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) airs of pert pretension and underbred finery.
<p/>Actually to discover that Mr. Knightley is a gentleman! I doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) will return the compliment, and discover her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be a lady.
<p/>I could not have believed it! And to propose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and I should unite to form a musical club! One would fancy we were bosom friends!
<p/>And Mrs. Weston!--Astonished that the person who had brought me up should be a gentlewoman! Worse and worse. I never met with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) equal.
<p/>Much beyond my hopes. Harriet is disgraced by any comparison. Oh! what would Frank Churchill say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) were here?
<p/>How angry and how diverted he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would be! Ah! there I am--thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) directly. Always the first person to be thought of!
<p/>All this ran so glibly through her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thoughts, that by the time her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father had arranged himself, after the bustle of the Eltons' departure, and was ready to speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was very tolerably capable of attending.
<p/>How I catch myself out! Frank Churchill comes as regularly into my mind!''-- '' Well, my dear,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) deliberately began, <div class="bookquote">``considering we never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) before
<p/>, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) seems a very pretty sort of young lady; and I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was very much pleased with you.
<p/>But I believe I am nice; I do not like strange voices; and nobody speaks like you and poor Miss Taylor.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) speaks a little too quick. A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) seems a very obliging, pretty-behaved young lady, and no doubt will make him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) a very good wife.
<p/>I made the best excuses I could for not having been able to wait on him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) and Mrs. Elton on this happy occasion; I said that I hoped I should in the course of the summer.
<p/>Though I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had better not have married. But I ought to have gone before. Not to wait upon a bride is very remiss.

<p/>'' It ought to be no recommendation to you . It is encouraging people to marry if you make so much of them.''
<p/>No, my dear, I never encouraged any body to marry, but I would always wish to pay every proper attention to a lady--and a bride, especially, is never to be neglected.

<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, papa, if this is not encouragement to marry, I do not know what is. And I should never have expected you to be lending your sanction to such vanity-baits for poor young ladies.
<p/>This is a matter of mere common politeness and good-breeding, and has nothing to do with any encouragement to people to marry.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' My dear, you do not understand me. '' Emma had done. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father was growing nervous, and could not understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) .
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind returned to Mrs. Elton's offences, and long, very long, did they occupy her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). CHAPTER XV Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ill opinion of Mrs. Elton.
<p/>Such as Mrs. Elton appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) on this second interview, such she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) appeared whenever they met again,--self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant, and ill-bred.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had a little beauty and a little accomplishment, but so little judgment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs. Elton's consequence only could surpass.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) observation had been pretty correct. There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently from his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wife.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) new acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of judging, following the lead of Miss Bates's good-will, or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) professed herself, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton's praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse, who readily continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) first contribution and talked with a good grace of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) being <div class="bookquote">``very pleasant and very elegantly dressed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) seemed not merely happy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), but proud. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had appeared at first.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) feelings altered towards Emma.--Offended, probably, by the little encouragement which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) proposals of intimacy met with, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) drew back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; and though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which produced it was necessarily increasing Emma's dislike.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) manners, too--and Mr. Elton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet. They were sneering and negligent. Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet's cure; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very
<p/>much.--It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet's attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own share in the story, under a colouring the least favourable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) and the most soothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), had in all likelihood been given also.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was, of course, the object of their joint dislike.--When they had nothing else to say, it must be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet.
<p/>Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration--but without solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must be wanting to assist and befriend her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).--Before Emma had forfeited her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) confidence, and about the third time of their meeting, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heard all Mrs. Elton's knight-errantry on the subject.--
<p/>Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. ``Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse.--I quite rave about Jane
<p/>Fairfax.--A sweet, interesting creature. So mild and ladylike--and with such talents!--I assure you I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) has very extraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) plays extremely well.
<p/>I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point. Oh! she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) is absolutely charming! You will laugh at my warmth--but, upon my word, I talk of nothing
<p/>but Jane Fairfax.--And her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) situation is so calculated to affect one!--Miss Woodhouse, we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>).
<p/>Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown.--I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet, `Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, `And waste its fragrance on the desert air.'
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot think there is any danger of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>was Emma's calm answer--<div class="bookquote">``and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax's situation and understand what her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, I have no idea that you will suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) talents can be unknown.
<p/>We must bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) forward. We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' '' Oh!
<p/>but dear Miss Woodhouse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is now in such retirement, such obscurity, so thrown away.--Whatever advantages she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end!
<p/>And I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) feels it. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) does. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is very timid and silent. One can see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) feels the want of encouragement.
<p/>I am a great advocate for timidity--and I am sure one does not often meet with it.--But in those who are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing.
<p/>I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) the better for it. I must confess it is a recommendation to me. Oh! I assure you, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me more than I can express.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You appear to feel a great deal--but I am not aware how you or any of Miss Fairfax's acquaintance here, any of those who have known her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) longer than yourself, can shew her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) any other attention
<p/>than'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-- <div class="bookquote">``My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act. You and I need not be afraid.
<p/>We have carriages to fetch and convey her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) home, and we live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, the least inconvenient.--I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner, as could make me regret having asked more than Jane Fairfax to partake of it.
<p/>If we set the example, many will follow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations. I have no idea of that sort of thing.
<p/>My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the other way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense.
<p/>Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be--for we do not at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income.--However, my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane
<p/>Fairfax.--I shall certainly have her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) very often at my house, shall introduce her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) wherever I can, shall have musical parties to draw out her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) talents, and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation.
<p/>My acquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) shortly.--I shall introduce her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), of course, very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us.
<p/>I am sure they will like her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) extremely; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) gets a little acquainted with them, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) fears will completely wear off, for there really is nothing in the manners of either
<p/>but what is highly conciliating.--I shall have her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) very often indeed while they are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>It is not likely that I should , considering what I have been used to. <div class="bookquote">``Poor Jane Fairfax!'' (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>--thought Emma.--<div class="bookquote">``You have not deserved this.
<p/>You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited!--The kindness and protection of Mrs. Elton!--`Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.'
<p/>Let me not suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me!--But upon my honour, there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman's tongue!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma had not to listen to such paradings again--to any so exclusively addressed to herself--so disgustingly decorated with a <div class="bookquote">``dear Miss Woodhouse.
<p/>The change on Mrs. Elton's side soon afterwards appeared, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was left in peace--neither forced to be the very particular friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton's guidance, the very active patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a general way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) looked on with some amusement.--Miss Bates's gratitude for Mrs. Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was quite one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) worthies--the most amiable, affable, delightful woman--just as accomplished and condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered.
<p/>Heavens! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>Emma's only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs. Elton as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) seemed to do.
<p/>This was astonishing!--She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is a riddle, quite a riddle!'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).--<div class="bookquote">``To chuse to remain here month after month, under privations of every sort!
<p/>And now to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) conversation, rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) with such real, generous affection.
<p/>Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and fresh invitations had arrived for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to join them there.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) walking with the Eltons, sitting with the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>'' According to Miss Bates--it all came from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)--
<p/>Would Jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friends contrived--no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had declined it! ''
<p/>Mrs. Dixon had written most pressingly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing this invitation,'' was Emma's conclusion.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must be under some sort of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself. There is great fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is not to be with the Dixons .
<p/>The decree is issued by somebody. But why must she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) consent to be with the Eltons?--Here is quite a separate puzzle.
<p/>Upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) speaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before the few who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston ventured this apology for Jane.
<p/>We cannot suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage, my dear Emma--but it is better than being always at home.
<p/>'' '' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) taste for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) goes to.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are right, Mrs. Weston,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley warmly, ``Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton.
<p/>Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) have chosen with whom to associate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would not have chosen her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). But -LRB-with a reproachful smile at Emma-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) receives attentions from Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).
<p/>With a faint blush, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) presently replied, <div class="bookquote">``Such attentions as Mrs. Elton's, I should have imagined, would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) a momentary glance; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was herself struck by his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) warmth. Mrs. Elton's invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should not wonder,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston, ``if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own inclination, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) aunt's eagerness in accepting Mrs. Elton's civilities for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).
<p/>Poor Miss Bates may very likely have committed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece and hurried her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) into a greater appearance of intimacy than her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) own good sense would have dictated, in spite of the very natural wish of a little change.
<p/>Both felt rather anxious to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) speak again; and after a few minutes silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Another thing must be taken into consideration too--
<p/>We all know the difference between the pronouns he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) or she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) and thou, the plainest spoken amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other--a something more early implanted.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Mrs. Elton does not talk to Miss Fairfax as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) speaks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before.
<p/>And besides the operation of this, as a general principle, you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) superiority both of mind and manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) with all the respect which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has a claim to.
<p/>Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs. Elton's way before--and no degree of vanity can prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) acknowledging her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own comparative littleness in action, if not in consciousness.
<p/>We feel things differently. '' <div class="bookquote">``I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma. Little Henry was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) irresolute what else to say.
<p/>'' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``any body may know how highly I think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' And yet,'' said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look, but soon stopping
<p/>--it was better, however, to know the worst at once--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hurried on--``And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is.
<p/>Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) thick leather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together, or some other cause, brought the colour into his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) face, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! are you there?--But you are miserably behindhand.
<p/>The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mr. Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) stopped.--Emma felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did not herself know what to think. In a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) went on--
<p/>Miss Fairfax, I dare say, would not have me if I were to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--and I am very sure I shall never ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will never be, however, I can assure you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>Emma returned her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend's pressure with interest; and was pleased enough to exclaim, ``You are not vain, Mr. Knightley.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seemed hardly to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was thoughtful--and in a manner which shewed him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) not pleased, soon afterwards said, <div class="bookquote">``So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>I will say that for you. '' '' No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for match-making, for me to presume to take such a liberty with you.
<p/>What I said just now, meant nothing. One says those sort of things, of course, without any idea of a serious meaning.
<p/>Oh! no, upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were married.

<p/>'' Well,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, very soon.

<p/>Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) neighbours.'' '' In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world!
<p/>I wonder how she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) speaks of the Coles--what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) calls them! How can she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) find any appellation for them, deep enough in familiar vulgarity?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) calls you, Knightley--what can she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) do for Mr. Cole? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) civilities and consents to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>).
<p/>I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax's mind over Mrs. Elton.
<p/>acknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) being under any restraint beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own scanty rule of good-breeding.
<p/>I cannot imagine that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) will not be continually insulting her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) visitor with praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) will not be continually detailing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) magnificent intentions, from the procuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) a permanent situation to the including her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau.''
<p/>Mrs. Weston, your argument weighs most with me.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) sensibilities, I suspect, are strong--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) temper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience, self-control; but it wants openness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) is reserved, more reserved, I think, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) used to be--
<p/>And I love an open temper. No--till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment, it had never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), with admiration and pleasure always--but with no thought beyond.
<p/>Well, Mrs. Weston,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Emma triumphantly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) left them, <div class="bookquote">``what do you say now to Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is so very much occupied by the idea of not being in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), that I should not wonder if it were to end in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) being so at last.
<p/>Every body in and about Highbury who had ever visited Mr. Elton, was disposed to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) attention on his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) marriage.
<p/>Dinner-parties and evening-parties were made for him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) lady; and invitations flowed in so fast that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had soon the pleasure of apprehending they were never to have a disengaged day.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Do not beat me.'' CHAPTER XVI '' I see how it is,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). '' I see what a life I am to lead among you.
<p/>Upon my word we shall be absolutely dissipated. We really seem quite the fashion. If this is living in the country, it is nothing very formidable.
<p/>From Monday next to Saturday, I assure you we have not a disengaged day!--A woman with fewer resources than I have, need not have been at a loss.
<p/>'' No invitation came amiss to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Bath habits made evening-parties perfectly natural to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and Maple Grove had given her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a taste for dinners.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a little shocked at the want of two drawing rooms, at the poor attempt at rout-cakes, and there being no ice in the Highbury card-parties.
<p/>Mrs. Bates, Mrs. Perry, Mrs. Goddard and others, were a good deal behind-hand in knowledge of the world, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) would soon shew them how every thing ought to be arranged.
<p/>In the course of the spring she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) must return their civilities by one very superior party--in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) card-tables should be set out with their separate candles and unbroken packs in the true style--and more waiters engaged for the evening than their own establishment could furnish, to carry round the refreshments at exactly the proper hour, and in the proper order.
<p/>They must not do less than others, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) should be exposed to odious suspicions, and imagined capable of pitiful resentment.
<p/>Emma, in the meanwhile, could not be satisfied without a dinner at Hartfield for the Eltons. A dinner there must be.
<p/>After Emma had talked about it for ten minutes, Mr. Woodhouse felt no unwillingness, and only made the usual stipulation of not sitting at the bottom of the table himself, with the usual regular difficulty of deciding who should do it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>).
<p/>Besides the Eltons, it must be the Westons and Mr. Knightley; so far it was all of course--and it was hardly less inevitable that poor little Harriet must be asked to make the eighth:--but this invitation was not given with equal satisfaction, and on many accounts Emma was particularly pleased by Harriet's begging to be allowed to decline it.
<p/>The persons to be invited, required little thought. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would rather not be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) company more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could help.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not yet quite able to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) charming happy wife together, without feeling uncomfortable. If Miss Woodhouse would not be displeased, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would rather stay at home.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was delighted with the fortitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) little friend--for fortitude she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) knew it was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to give up being in company and stay at home; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could now invite the very person whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) really wanted to make the eighth, Jane Fairfax.--
<p/>Since her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) last conversation with Mrs. Weston and Mr. Knightley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was more conscience-stricken about Jane Fairfax than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had often been.--Mr.
<p/>'' It was precisely what Emma would have wished, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) deemed it possible enough for wishing. Knightley's words dwelt with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/>This is very true,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``at least as far as relates to me, which was all that was meant--and it is very shameful.--Of the same age--and always knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had said that Jane Fairfax received attentions from Mrs. Elton which nobody else paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--I ought to have been more her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) friend.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) will never like me now.
<p/>I have neglected her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) too long. But I will shew her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) greater attention than I have done. '' Every invitation was successful.
<p/>They were all disengaged and all happy.--The preparatory interest of this dinner, however, was not yet over. A circumstance rather unlucky occurred.
<p/>The two eldest little Knightleys were engaged to pay their grandpapa and aunt a visit of some weeks in the spring, and their papa now proposed bringing them, and staying one whole day at Hartfield--which one day would be the very day of this party.--His (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) professional engagements did not allow of his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) being put off, but both father and daughter were disturbed by its happening so.
<p/>Mr. Woodhouse considered eight persons at dinner together as the utmost that his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) nerves could bear--and here would be a ninth--and Emma apprehended that it would be a ninth very much out of humour at not being able to come even to Hartfield for forty-eight hours without falling in with a dinner-party.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could comfort herself, by representing that though he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) certainly would make them nine, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) always said so little, that the increase of noise would be very immaterial.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought it in reality a sad exchange for herself, to have him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grave looks and reluctant conversation opposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brother.
<p/>The event was more favourable to Mr. Woodhouse than to Emma. John Knightley came; but Mr. Weston was unexpectedly summoned to town and must be absent on the very day.
<p/>Mr. Woodhouse was quite at ease; and the seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) so, with the arrival of the little boys and the philosophic composure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) brother on hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) fate, removed the chief of even Emma's vexation.
<p/>The day came, the party were punctually assembled, and Mr. John Knightley seemed early to devote himself to the business of being agreeable.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) might be able to join them in the evening, but certainly not to dinner. Instead of drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) brother off to a window while they waited for dinner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was talking to Miss Fairfax.
<p/>Mrs. Elton, as elegant as lace and pearls could make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) looked at in silence--wanting only to observe enough for Isabella's information--but Miss Fairfax was an old acquaintance and a quiet girl, and he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) could talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had met her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) before breakfast as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was returning from a walk with his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) little boys, when it had been just beginning to rain.
<p/>It was natural to have some civil hopes on the subject, and he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you did not venture far, Miss Fairfax, this morning, or I am sure you must have been wet.--We scarcely got home in time.
<p/>I hope you turned directly. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I went only to the post-office,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and reached home before the rain was much.
<p/>It is my daily errand. I always fetch the letters when I am here. It saves trouble, and is a something to get me out.
<p/>A walk before breakfast does me good. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not a walk in the rain, I should imagine.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' No, but it did not absolutely rain when I set out.
<p/>Mr. John Knightley smiled, and replied, ``That is to say, you chose to have your walk, for you were not six yards from your own door when I had the pleasure of meeting you; and Henry and John had seen more drops than they could count long before.
<p/>When you have lived to my age, you will begin to think letters are never worth going through the rain for.
<p/>There was a little blush, and then this answer, <div class="bookquote">``I must not hope to be ever situated as you are, in the midst of every dearest connexion, and therefore I cannot expect that simply growing older should make me indifferent about letters.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The post-office has a great charm at one period of our lives. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Indifferent! Oh! no --I never conceived you could become indifferent.
<p/>Letters are no matter of indifference; they are generally a very positive curse. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are speaking of letters of business; mine are letters of friendship.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have often thought them the worst of the two,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) coolly. '' Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you are not serious now. I know Mr. John Knightley too well --I am very sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) understands the value of friendship as well as any body.
<p/>I can easily believe that letters are very little to you, much less than to me, but it is not your being ten years older than myself which makes the difference, it is not age, but situation.
<p/>You have every body dearest to you always at hand, I, probably, never shall again; and therefore till I have outlived all my affections, a post-office, I think, must always have power to draw me out, in worse weather than to-day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>When I talked of your being altered by time, by the progress of years,'' said John Knightley, ``I meant to imply the change of situation which time usually brings.
<p/>Time will generally lessen the interest of every attachment not within the daily circle--but that is not the change I had in view for you.
<p/>As an old friend, you will allow me to hope, Miss Fairfax, that ten years hence you may have as many concentrated objects as I have.
<p/>A pleasant <div class="bookquote">``thank you''  (<font color='red'><b>a lip</b></font>)</div>seemed meant to laugh it off, but a blush, a quivering lip, a tear in the eye, shewed that it was felt beyond a laugh.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) attention was now claimed by Mr. Woodhouse, who being, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) custom on such occasions, making the circle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) guests, and paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) particular compliments to the ladies, was ending with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)--and with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) mildest urbanity, said, <div class="bookquote">``I am very sorry to hear, Miss Fairfax, of your being out this morning in the rain.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>I consider one as including the other. '' It was kindly said, and very far from giving offence. Young ladies should take care of themselves.--Young ladies are delicate plants.
<p/>They should take care of their health and their complexion. My dear, did you change your stockings?'' '' Yes, sir, I did indeed; and I am very much obliged by your kind solicitude about me.''
<p/>'' My dear Miss Fairfax, young ladies are very sure to be cared for.--I hope your good grand-mama and aunt are well.
<p/>They are some of my very old friends. I wish my health allowed me to be a better neighbour. You do us a great deal of honour to-day, I am sure.
<p/>My daughter and I are both highly sensible of your goodness, and have the greatest satisfaction in seeing you at Hartfield.
<p/>The kind-hearted, polite old man might then sit down and feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty, and made every fair lady welcome and easy.
<p/>'' By this time, the walk in the rain had reached Mrs. Elton, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) remonstrances now opened upon Jane. ''
<p/>My dear Jane, what is this I hear?--Going to the post-office in the rain!--This must not be, I assure you.--You sad girl, how could you do such a thing?--It is a sign I was not there to take care of you.
<p/>'' Jane very patiently assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had not caught any cold. '' Oh! do not tell me . You really are a very sad girl, and do not know how to take care of yourself.--To the post-office indeed!
<p/>Mrs. Weston, did you ever hear the like? You and I must positively exert our authority.'' '' My advice,'' said Mrs. Weston kindly and persuasively, <div class="bookquote">``I certainly do feel tempted to give.
<p/>Miss Fairfax, you must not run such risks.--Liable as you have been to severe colds, indeed you ought to be particularly careful, especially at this time of year.
<p/>Better wait an hour or two, or even half a day for your letters, than run the risk of bringing on your cough again.
<p/>The spring I always think requires more than common care. Now do not you feel that you had? Yes, I am sure you are much too reasonable.
<p/>You look as if you would not do such a thing again.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) shall not do such a thing again,'' eagerly rejoined Mrs. Elton.
<p/>'' We will not allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to do such a thing again:''--and nodding significantly--<div class="bookquote">``there must be some arrangement made, there must indeed.
<p/>The man who fetches our letters every morning -LRB-one of our men, I forget his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name-RRB- shall inquire for yours too and bring them to you.
<p/>That will obviate all difficulties you know; and from us I really think, my dear Jane, you can have no scruple to accept such an accommodation.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>I am advised to be out of doors as much as I can, I must walk somewhere, and the post-office is an object; and upon my word, I have scarcely ever had a bad morning before.
<p/>I shall speak to Mr. E. <div class="bookquote">``You are extremely kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. E.</b></font>)</div>said Jane; <div class="bookquote">``but I cannot give up my early walk. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Jane Fairfax</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>The thing is determined, that is -LRB-laughing affectedly-RRB- as far as I can presume to determine any thing without the concurrence of my lord and master.
<p/>My dear Jane, say no more about it. You know, Mrs. Weston, you and I must be cautious how we express ourselves.
<p/>But I do flatter myself, my dear Jane, that my influence is not entirely worn out. If I meet with no insuperable difficulties therefore, consider that point as settled.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Excuse me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Jane Fairfax</b></font>)</div>said Jane earnestly, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot by any means consent to such an arrangement, so needlessly troublesome to your servant.
<p/>If the errand were not a pleasure to me, it could be done, as it always is when I am not here, by my grandmama's.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Jane Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh! my dear; but so much as Patty has to do!--And it is a kindness to employ our men. ''
<p/>Jane looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did not mean to be conquered; but instead of answering, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) began speaking again to Mr. John Knightley.
<p/>'' The post-office is a wonderful establishment!'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).--<div class="bookquote">``The regularity and despatch of it! If one thinks of all that it has to do, and all that it does
<p/>So seldom that a letter, among the thousands that are constantly passing about the kingdom, is even carried wrong--and not one in a million, I suppose, actually lost!
<p/>And when one considers the variety of hands, and of bad hands too, that are to be deciphered, it increases the wonder.
<p/>so well, it is really astonishing!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is certainly very well regulated.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``So seldom that any negligence or blunder appears! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>The clerks</b></font>)</div><p/>'' The clerks grow expert from habit.--They must begin with some quickness of sight and hand, and exercise improves them. If you want any farther explanation,'' continued he (<font color='blue'><b>expert</b></font>), smiling, <div class="bookquote">``they are paid for it.
<p/>That is the key to a great deal of capacity. The public pays and must be served well. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The varieties of handwriting were farther talked of, and the usual observations made.
<p/>I have heard it asserted,'' said John Knightley, <div class="bookquote">``that the same sort of handwriting often prevails in a family; and where the same master teaches, it is natural enough.
<p/>But for that reason, I should imagine the likeness must be chiefly confined to the females, for boys have very little teaching after an early age, and scramble into any hand they can get.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>Isabella and Emma, I think, do write very much alike. I have not always known their writing apart.'' '' Yes,'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) brother hesitatingly, <div class="bookquote">``there is a likeness.
<p/>I know what you mean--but Emma's hand is the strongest.''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Isabella and Emma both write beautifully,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse; <div class="bookquote">``and always did.
<p/>I never saw any gentleman's handwriting'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>--Emma began, looking also at Mrs. Weston; but stopped, on perceiving that Mrs. Weston was attending to some one else--and the pause gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) time to reflect, <div class="bookquote">``Now, how am I going to introduce
<p/>And so does poor Mrs. Weston'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>--with half a sigh and half a smile at her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). '' him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)?--Am I unequal to speaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) name at once before all these people?
<p/>Is it necessary for me to use any roundabout phrase?--Your Yorkshire friend--your correspondent in Yorkshire;--that would be the way, I suppose, if I were very bad.--No, I can pronounce his (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>) name without the smallest distress.
<p/>I certainly get better and better.--Now for it. '' Mrs. Weston was disengaged and Emma began again--<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Frank Churchill writes one of the best gentleman's hands I ever saw.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not admire it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley. '' It is too small--wants strength. It is like a woman's writing. ''
<p/>This was not submitted to by either lady. They vindicated him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) against the base aspersion. '' No, it by no means wanted strength--it was not a large hand, but very clear and certainly strong.
<p/>Had not Mrs. Weston any letter about her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to produce? '' No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) very lately, but having answered the letter, had put it away.
<p/>If we were in the other room,'' said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``if I had my writing-desk, I am sure I could produce a specimen.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>I have a note of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).--Do not you remember, Mrs. Weston, employing him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to write for you one day?'' ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) chose to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was employed''-- <div class="bookquote">``Well, well, I have that note; and can shew it after dinner to convince Mr. Knightley.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh! when a gallant young man, like Mr. Frank Churchill,'' said Mr. Knightley dryly, <div class="bookquote">``writes to a fair lady like Miss Woodhouse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) will, of course, put forth his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) best.
<p/>Elton, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could be spoken to, was ready; and before Mr. Woodhouse had reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) request to be allowed to hand her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) into the dining-parlour, was saying--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>'' Dinner was on table.--Mrs. <div class="bookquote">``Must I go first? I really am ashamed of always leading the way. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Jane Fairfax</b></font>)</div>Jane's solicitude about fetching her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own letters had not escaped Emma.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had heard and seen it all; and felt some curiosity to know whether the wet walk of this morning had produced any.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) suspected that it had ; that it would not have been so resolutely encountered but in full expectation of hearing from some one very dear, and that it had not been in vain.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could have made an inquiry or two, as to the expedition and the expense of the Irish mails;--it was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tongue's end--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) abstained.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was quite determined not to utter a word that should hurt Jane Fairfax's feelings; and they followed the other ladies out of the room, arm in arm, with an appearance of good-will highly becoming to the beauty and grace of each.
<p/>When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties;--with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought there was an air of greater happiness than usual--a glow both of complexion and spirits. CHAPTER XVII did Mrs. Elton engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) and Mrs. Weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together. Mrs. Elton left them no choice.
<p/>If Jane repressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) for a little time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) soon began again; and though much that passed between them was in a half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton's side, there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects:
<p/>The post-office--catching cold--fetching letters--and friendship, were long under discussion; and to them succeeded one, which must be at least equally unpleasant to Jane--
<p/>inquiries whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), and professions of Mrs. Elton's meditated activity. ''
<p/>Here is April come! '' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I get quite anxious about you. June will soon be here.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' But I have never fixed on June or any other month--merely looked forward to the summer in general.''
<p/>'' But have you really heard of nothing?'' <div class="bookquote">``I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet.
<p/>Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' I not aware!'' said Jane, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) head; <div class="bookquote">``dear Mrs. Elton, who can have thought of it as I have done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Jane Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You do not know how many candidates there always are for the first situations.
<p/>A cousin of Mr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity of applications; every body was anxious to be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bragge</b></font>) family, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Bragge</b></font>) moves in the first circle.
<p/>I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove. Wax-candles in the schoolroom! You may imagine how desirable!
<p/>Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge's is the one I would most wish to see you in.'' <div class="bookquote">``Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Jane Fairfax</b></font>)</div>said Jane.
<p/>'' I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will want it;--afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself.
<p/>But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present. '' <div class="bookquote">``Trouble! aye , I know your scruples.
<p/>You are afraid of giving me trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am.
<p/>I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in a day or two, and shall give her (<font color='blue'><b>Partridge</b></font>) a strict charge to be on the look-out for any thing eligible.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her (<font color='blue'><b>Partridge</b></font>); till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any body trouble.''
 (<font color='red'><b>child</b></font>)</div><p/>But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, and June, or say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplish before us.
<p/>A situation such as you deserve, and your friends would require for you, is no everyday occurrence, is not obtained at a moment's notice; indeed, indeed, we must begin inquiring directly.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Excuse me, ma'am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Your inexperience really amuses me! When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed.
<p/>There are places in town, offices, where inquiry would soon produce something--Offices for the sale--not quite of human flesh--but of human intellect.
<p/>You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Jane Fairfax</b></font>)</div>replied Jane; <div class="bookquote">``governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies.
<p/>But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices, and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Jane Fairfax</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' Oh! my dear, human flesh! <div class="bookquote">``Something that would do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>repeated Mrs. Elton. '' Aye, that may suit your humble ideas of yourself;--I
<p/>know what a modest creature you are; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, in a family not moving in a certain circle, or able to command the elegancies of life.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent; it would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications, I think, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison.
<p/>I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I shall be a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side; with your superior talents, you have a right to move in the first circle.
<p/>Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms, have as many rooms as you like, and mix in the family as much as you chose;--that is--I do not know--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>A gentleman</b></font>)</div>A gentleman's family is all that I should condition for.'' '' if you knew the harp, you might do all that
<p/>, I am very sure; but you sing as well as play;--yes, I really believe you might, even without the harp, stipulate for what you chose;--and you must and shall be delightfully, honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest.''
<p/>You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of such a situation together,'' said Jane, <div class="bookquote">``they are pretty sure to be equal; however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me.
<p/>I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mrs. Elton, I am obliged to any body who feels for me, but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer.
<p/>And I am quite serious too, I assure you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Jane Fairfax</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Elton gaily, <div class="bookquote">``in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends to watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div><p/>In this style she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr. Woodhouse came into the room; her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) vanity had then a change of object, and Emma heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saying in the same half-whisper to Jane, <div class="bookquote">``Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest!--Only think of his (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>) gallantry in coming away before the other men!--what a dear creature he (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>) is;--I assure you I like him (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>) excessively.
<p/>I admire all that quaint, old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease; modern ease often disgusts me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Jane Fairfax</b></font>)</div>For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am, and as I am.'' '' But this good old Mr. Woodhouse, I wish you had heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) gallant speeches to me at dinner.
<p/>Oh! I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous. I fancy I am rather a favourite; he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) took notice of my gown.
<p/>How do you like it?--Selina's choice--handsome, I think, but I do not know whether it is not over-trimmed ; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over-trimmed--quite a horror of finery.
<p/>A bride, you know, must appear like a bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery.
<p/>But I am quite in the minority, I believe; few people seem to value simplicity of dress,--show and finery are every thing.
<p/>I must put on a few ornaments now, because it is expected of me. I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin.
<p/>Do you think it will look well? '' The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when Mr. Weston made his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) appearance among them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had returned to a late dinner, and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been too much expected by the best judges, for surprize--but there was great joy.
<p/>John Knightley only was in mute astonishment.--That a man who might have spent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) evening quietly at home after a day of business in London, should set off again, and walk half a mile to another man's house, for the sake of being in mixed company till bed-time, of finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers, was a circumstance to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deeply.
<p/>A man who had been in motion since eight o'clock in the morning, and might now have been still, who had been long talking, and might have been silent, who had been in more than one crowd, and might have been alone!--Such a man, to quit the tranquillity and independence of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own fireside, and on the evening of a cold sleety April day
<p/>Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would have been sorry to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) before. rush out again into the world!--Could
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) by a touch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) finger have instantly taken back his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) wife, there would have been a motive; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party.
<p/>John Knightley looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) with amazement, then shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) shoulders, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I could not have believed it even of him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) .
<p/>Mr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the right of being principal talker, which a day spent anywhere from home confers, was making himself agreeable among the rest; and having satisfied the inquiries of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) dinner, convincing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that none of all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) careful directions to the servants had been forgotten, and spread abroad what public news he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had heard, was proceeding to a family communication, which, though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) a letter, it was from Frank, and to herself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had met with it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) way, and had taken the liberty of opening it.
<p/>Read it, read it,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it will give you pleasure; only a few lines--will not take you long; read it to Emma.
<p/>The two ladies looked over it together; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) sat smiling and talking to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but very audible to every body.
<p/>Well, what do you say to it?--I always told you he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) would be here again soon, did not I?--Anne, my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would not believe me?--In town next week, you see--at the latest, I dare say; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done; most likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is coming, you see; good news, I think. As to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) illness, all nothing of course.
<p/>But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again, so near as town. They will stay a good while when they do come, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) will be half his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) time with us.
<p/>This is precisely what I wanted. Well, pretty good news, is not it? Have you finished it? Has Emma read it all?
<p/>Put it up, put it up; we will have a good talk about it some other time, but it will not do now.
<p/>I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way. '' Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) looks and words had nothing to restrain them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was happy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was happy, and knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) ought to be happy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was a little occupied in weighing her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own feelings, and trying to understand the degree of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) agitation, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) rather thought was considerable.
<p/>Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative to want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did say, and soon moved away to make the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already.
<p/>It was well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) took every body's joy for granted, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might not have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularly delighted.
<p/>They were the first entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to be made happy;--from them he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was so deep in conversation with John Knightley, that it would have been too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) attention disengaged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) necessarily began on the subject with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) congratulations were warm and open; but Emma could not speak so fluently. CHAPTER XVIII '' I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,'' said Mr. Weston.
<p/>Mrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) by such a hope, smiled most graciously. '' You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill
<p/>, I presume,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) continued--<div class="bookquote">``and know him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to be my son, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) does not bear my name.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) acquaintance.
<p/>I am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>); and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) at the Vicarage.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very obliging.--Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.-- He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) is to be in town next week, if not sooner.
<p/>I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing my son's hand, presumed to open it--though it was not directed to me--it was to Mrs. Weston.
<p/>We have notice of it in a letter to-day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) principal correspondent, I assure you. I hardly ever get a letter.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I must protest against that.--A most dangerous precedent indeed!--I beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example.--Upon my word,
<p/>'' And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)! Oh! Mr. Weston---LRB-laughing affectedly-RRB- if this is what I am to expect, we married women must begin to exert ourselves!--Oh!
<p/>You must take care of yourself, Mrs. Elton.--This letter tells us--it is a short letter--written in a hurry, merely to give us notice--it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly, on Mrs. Churchill's account--she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) has not been well the whole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)--so they are all to move southward without loss of time.''
<p/>Mr. Weston, I could not have believed it of you!'' <div class="bookquote">``Aye, we men are sad fellows. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Indeed!--from Yorkshire, I think.
<p/>Enscombe is in Yorkshire?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London, a considerable journey. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, upon my word, very considerable.
<p/>But what is distance, Mr. Weston, to people of large fortune?--You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr. Suckling, sometimes flies about.
<p/>You will hardly believe me--but twice in one week he (<font color='blue'><b>Suckling</b></font>) and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four horses.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>The evil of the distance from Enscombe,'' said Mr. Weston, <div class="bookquote">``is, that Mrs. Churchill, as we understand , has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together.
<p/>In Frank's last letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) complained, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) said, of being too weak to get into her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) conservatory without having both his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) arm and his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) uncle's!
<p/>This, you know, speaks a great degree of weakness--but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is so impatient to be in town, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) means to sleep only two nights on the road.--So Frank writes word.
<p/>Sixty-five miles farther than from Maple Grove to London. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>Certainly, delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions, Mrs. Elton. You must grant me that.''
<p/>'' No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I always take the part of my own sex. I do indeed. I give you notice--You will find me a formidable antagonist on that point.
<p/>I always stand up for women--and I assure you, if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn, you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill's making incredible exertions to avoid it.
<p/>Selina says it is quite horror to her (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>)--and I believe I have caught a little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) nicety. She (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) always travels with her (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) own sheets; an excellent precaution.
<p/>Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?'' <div class="bookquote">``Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did.
<p/>Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>-- Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! Mr. Weston, do not mistake me.
<p/>Selina is no fine lady, I assure you. Do not run away with such an idea.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is not she (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>)? Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld.
<p/>It was by no means her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) object to have it believed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) sister was not a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it;--and
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Elton began to think she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly. she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was considering in what way she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had best retract, when Mr. Weston went on.
<p/>'' Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect--but this is quite between ourselves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is very fond of Frank, and therefore I would not speak ill of her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>).
<p/>Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is out of health now; but that indeed, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own account, she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) has always been. I would not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faith in Mrs. Churchill's illness.''
<p/>'' If she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston?--To Bath, or to Clifton?'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) has taken it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) head that Enscombe is too cold for her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>).
<p/>The fact is, I suppose, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is tired of Enscombe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) has now been a longer time stationary there, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) ever was before, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) begins to want change.
<p/>It is a retired place. A fine place, but very retired. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aye--like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more retired from the road than Maple Grove.
<p/>Such an immense plantation all round it! You seem shut out from every thing--in the most complete retirement.--And Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion.
<p/>I always say a woman cannot have too many resources--and I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent of society.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Or, perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life. '' Frank was here in February for a fortnight.''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) will find an addition to the society of Highbury when he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) comes again; that is, if I may presume to call myself an addition.
<p/>'' So I remember to have heard. But perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world.
<p/>This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr. Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``My dear madam!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible. Not heard of you!--I believe Mrs. Weston's letters lately have been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton.
<p/>When Frank left us,'' continued he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it was quite uncertain when we might see him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had done his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) duty and could return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) son. '' It has been completely unexpected. That is, I always had a strong persuasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) would be here again soon
<p/>, I was sure something favourable would turn up--but nobody believed me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully desponding. '
<p/>How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) contrive to come? And how could it be supposed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) uncle and aunt would spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) again?'
<p/>I have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life, that if things are going untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next.''
<p/>and so forth --I always felt that something would happen in our favour; and so it has, you see. <div class="bookquote">``Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true.
<p/>It is just what I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when, because things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) feelings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was apt to be in despair, and exclaim that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was sure at this rate it would be May before Hymen's saffron robe would be put on for us.
<p/>Oh! the pains I have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) cheerfuller views! The carriage--we had disappointments about the carriage;--one morning, I remember, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) came to me quite in despair.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on. ''
<p/>May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill is ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place than Enscombe--in short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring--precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost at the longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, and never too hot for exercise.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was here before, we made the best of it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather; there always is in February, you know, and we could not do half that we intended.
<p/>This will be complete enjoyment; and I do not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the sort of constant expectation there will be of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) coming in to-day or to-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than having him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) actually in the house.
<p/>You were mentioning May. Now will be the time. I think it is so. I think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight.
<p/>I hope you will be pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) is generally thought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy.
<p/>Mrs. Weston's partiality for him (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) is very great, and, as you may suppose, most gratifying to me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) thinks nobody equal to him (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>).''
<p/>'' And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) favour.
<p/>I have heard so much in praise of Mr. Frank Churchill.--At the same time it is fair to observe, that I am one of those who always judge for themselves, and are by no means implicitly guided by others.
<p/>I give you notice that as I find your son, so I shall judge of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).--I am no flatterer. '' Mr. Weston was musing.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is ill I should be sorry to do her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) injustice; but there are some traits in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) character which make it difficult for me to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) with the forbearance I could wish.
<p/>You cannot be ignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the treatment I have met with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of it is to be laid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).
<p/>'' I hope,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) presently, <div class="bookquote">``I have not been severe upon poor Mrs. Churchill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was the instigator. Frank's mother would never have been slighted as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was but for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>: his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome; but her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pride is arrogance and insolence!
<p/>Mr. Churchill has pride; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) pride is nothing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) wife's And what inclines one less to bear, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has no fair pretence of family or blood.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was nobody when he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) married her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), barely the daughter of a gentleman; but ever since her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) being turned into a Churchill she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has out-Churchill'd them all in high and mighty claims: but in herself, I assure you, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is an upstart.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have quite a horror of upstarts. Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them directly.
<p/>People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, and encumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immense airs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families.
<p/>A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows.
<p/>They came from Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you know, Mr. Weston. One has not great hopes from Birmingham.
<p/>I always say there is something direful in the sound: but nothing more is positively known of the Tupmans, though a good many things I assure you are suspected; and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours.
<p/>Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)--I believe, at least--I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed the purchase before his (<font color='blue'><b>Suckling</b></font>) death.
<p/>It is infinitely too bad. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston, having said all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away.
<p/>The remaining five were left to their own powers, and Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed little disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, which nobody had inclination to pay, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) prefer being silent.
<p/>After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr. Woodhouse to cards. Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) brother.
<p/>Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is down at full length there
<p/>My charge would be much more concise than her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have to recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic them.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I rather hope to satisfy you both,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``for I shall do all in my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father--or even may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That is very likely. You think so, do not you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Increase!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a great difference in your way of life.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Difference! No indeed I am not. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be.
<p/>Witness this very time. Here am I come down for only one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party!--When did it happen before, or any thing like it?
<p/>Your neighbourhood is increasing, and you mix more with it. A little while ago, every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties;
<p/>dinners at Mr. Cole's, or balls at the Crown. The difference which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in your goings-on, is very great.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well--and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less influence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma, that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>brother Randalls</b></font>)</div>'' Yes,'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) brother quickly, <div class="bookquote">``it is Randalls that does it all. ''  (<font color='red'><b>brother Randalls</b></font>)</div>And if they are, I only beg you to send them home.''
<p/>'' No,'' cried Mr. Knightley, <div class="bookquote">``that need not be the consequence. Let them be sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div><p/>I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Emma, <div class="bookquote">``you amuse me! These amazing engagements of mine--what have they been? Dining once with the Coles--and having a ball talked of, which never took place.
<p/>I can understand you---LRB-nodding at Mr. John Knightley-RRB---your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed.
<p/>But you, -LRB-turning to Mr. Knightley,-RRB- who know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield, why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me, I cannot imagine.
<p/>And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that if Aunt Emma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five hours where she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is absent one--and who, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) is at home, is either reading to himself or settling his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) accounts.
<p/>Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton's beginning to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).
<p/>A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>VOLUME III CHAPTER I She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was soon convinced that it was not for herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>).
<p/>of;--but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had taken away, it would be very distressing.
<p/>If a separation of two months should not have cooled him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), there were dangers and evils before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>):--caution for him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) and for herself would be necessary.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not mean to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own affections entangled again, and it would be incumbent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to avoid any encouragement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might be able to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) from an absolute declaration.
<p/>That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance! and yet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not help rather anticipating something decisive.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis, an event, a something to alter her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) present composed and tranquil state.
<p/>It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill's feelings.
<p/>The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was at Highbury very soon afterwards.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) rode down for a couple of hours; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not yet do more; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) could then exercise all her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) quick observation, and speedily determine how he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was influenced, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) must act.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had an almost instant doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) caring for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had done, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) feeling the same tenderness in the same degree.
<p/>They met with the utmost friendliness. There could be no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) great pleasure in seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) well.
<p/>It was a clear thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was less in love than he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been. Absence, with the conviction probably of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) indifference, had produced this very natural and very desirable effect.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed delighted to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) former visit, and recur to old stories: and he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was not without agitation.
<p/>It was not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) calmness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) read his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) comparative difference. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was not calm; his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) spirits were evidently fluttered; there was restlessness about him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>).
<p/>Lively as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself; but what decided her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) belief on the subject, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) staying only a quarter of an hour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) passed--he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had not stopped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would not stop for more than a word--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) did not call, and much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) wished to stay longer at Hartfield, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) must hurry off.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had no doubt as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) being less in love--but neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) agitated spirits, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) returning power, and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) long.
<p/>'' '' This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was often hoping, intending to come--but was always prevented.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) were quite sincere, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) really tried to come, it was to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill's removal to London had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) disorder.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) aunt could not bear to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). Such was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own account at Randall's. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was really ill was very certain; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had declared himself convinced of it, at Randalls.
<p/>Though much might be fancy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not doubt, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) looked back, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was in a weaker state of health than she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been half a year ago.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove, or at least that she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) might not have many years of existence before her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not be prevailed on, by all his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's doubts, to say that her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) complaints were merely imaginary, or that she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was as strong as ever.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nerves were under continual irritation and suffering; and by the ten days' end, her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew's letter to Randalls communicated a change of plan.
<p/>It soon appeared that London was not the place for her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not endure its noise. They were going to remove immediately to Richmond.
<p/>Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place.
<p/>Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement, and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends--for the house was taken for May and June.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was told that now he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them, almost as often as he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) could even wish.
<p/>A ready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefit expected from the change. Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was considering her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) as the source of all the happiness they offered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hoped it was not so. Two months must bring it to the proof.
<p/>Mr. Weston's own happiness was indisputable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was quite delighted. It was the very circumstance he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could have wished for. Now, it would be really having Frank in their neighbourhood.
<p/>The difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) always and seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) never.
<p/>What were nine miles to a young man?--An hour's ride. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be always coming over. Sixteen miles--nay, eighteen--it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street--was a serious obstacle.
<p/>There was no comfort in having him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in London; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might as well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse.
<p/>Were he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ever able to get away, the day would be spent in coming and returning. Better than nearer! One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal,--the ball at the Crown.
<p/>Now, however, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and very soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines from Frank, to say that his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) aunt felt already much better for the change, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four hours at any given time, induced them to name as early a day as possible.
<p/>It had not been forgotten before, but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. Mr. Weston's ball was to be a real thing.
<p/>A very few to-morrows stood between the young people of Highbury and happiness. Mr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>).
<p/>Mrs. Bates was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any thing the matter with them, while dear Emma were gone.
<p/>The day approached, the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, Frank Churchill, in all the certainty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own self, reached Randalls before dinner, and every thing was safe.
<p/>May was better for every thing than February. CHAPTER II No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. No second meeting had there yet been between him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) and Emma.
<p/>Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) entreaties for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arriving there as soon as possible after themselves, for the purpose of taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man's company.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in good time, the Randalls party just sufficiently before them.
<p/>Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) did not say much, his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) eyes declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) meant to have a delightful evening.
<p/>They all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it should be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first, without great surprize.
<p/>The room at the Crown was to witness it;--but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd. ''
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was going to exclaim; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) presently found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming, like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment; and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins, who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection.
<p/>Emma perceived that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) open manners, but a little less of open-heartedness would have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) a higher character.--General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a man what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to be.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could fancy such a man.
<p/>The whole party walked about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though May , a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.
<p/>So unreasonably early! '' Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger.
<p/>They had stopped at Mrs. Bates's door to offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was looking about, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was going to the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was watching for the sound of other carriages,--impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).
<p/>Frank was standing by her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), but not steadily; there was a restlessness, which shewed a mind not at ease. Mrs. Elton was spoken of.
<p/>'' I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) must be here soon,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>). '' I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).
<p/>It cannot be long, I think, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) comes. '' A carriage was heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was on the move immediately; but coming back, said, <div class="bookquote">``I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).
<p/>I have never seen either Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself forward. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed. ''
<p/>But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!'' said Mr. Weston, looking about. '' We thought you were to bring them. '' The mistake had been slight.
<p/>Emma longed to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; how he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was affected by the studied elegance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) dress, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) smiles of graciousness.
<p/>The carriage was sent for them now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion, by giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) very proper attention, after the introduction had passed.
<p/>In a few minutes the carriage returned.--Somebody talked of rain.--<div class="bookquote">``I will see that there are umbrellas, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said Frank to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) father: <div class="bookquote">``Miss Bates must not be forgotten:''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>and away he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) went.
<p/>Mr. Weston was following; but Mrs. Elton detained him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), to gratify him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son; and so briskly did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) begin, that the young man himself, though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.
<p/>You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).--You
<p/>I think him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a very handsome young man, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manners are precisely what I like and approve--so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism.
<p/>'' A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. may believe me. I never compliment. You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies--quite a horror of them.
<p/>They were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very cutting things!
<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>Suckling</b></font>) son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) got to Maple Grove, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grove</b></font>) could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.
<p/>Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them much better. '' Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. ''
<p/>I have no doubt of its being our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are so extremely
<p/>expeditious!--I believe we drive faster than any body.--What a pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend!--I understand you were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite unnecessary.
<p/>Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) duty as Mrs. Weston's to receive them.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) words, every body's words, were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in talking, and had not finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) speech under many minutes after her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) being admitted into the circle at the fire.
<p/>You may be very sure I shall always take care of them . '' As the door opened she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was heard, <div class="bookquote">``So very obliging of you!--No rain at all.
<p/>Nothing to signify. I do not care for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares--Well!---LRB-as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was within the door-RRB-
<p/>Well! This is brilliant indeed!--This is admirable!--Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could not have imagined it.--So well lighted up!--Jane, Jane, look!--did you ever see any thing?
<p/>Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin's lamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Stokes</b></font>) own room again. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Stokes</b></font>) as I came in; she (<font color='blue'><b>Stokes</b></font>) was standing in the entrance. '
<p/>Oh! Mrs. Stokes,' said I--but I had not time for more. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Stokes</b></font>) was now met by Mrs. Weston.--``Very well, I thank you, ma'am.
<p/>I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hear it. So afraid you might have a headache!--seeing you pass by so often, and knowing how much trouble you must have.
<p/>Delighted to hear it indeed. Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the carriage!--excellent time. Jane and I quite ready.
<p/>Did not keep the horses a moment. Most comfortable carriage.--Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score.
<p/>Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been.--But two such offers in one day!--Never were such neighbours.
<p/>I made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) take her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) shawl--for the evenings are not warm--her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) large new shawl-- Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present.--So kind of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to think of my mother!
<p/>I said to my mother, `Upon my word, ma'am--.' Thank you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr. Woodhouse's. Bought at Weymouth, you know--Mr.
<p/>Dixon's choice. There were three others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time. Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane, are you sure you did not wet
<p/>your feet?--It was but a drop or two, but I am so afraid:--but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely--and there was a mat to step upon
<p/>Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you my mother's spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet never came out again.
<p/>--I shall never forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) extreme politeness.--Oh! My mother often talks of your good-nature. Does not she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), Jane?--Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill?--Ah!
<p/>This is meeting quite in fairy-land!--Such a transformation!--Must not compliment, I know -LRB-eyeing Emma most complacently-RRB---that would be rude--but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse, you do look--how do you like Jane's hair?--You
<p/>here's Miss Woodhouse.--Dear Miss Woodhouse , how do you do?--Very well I thank you, quite well. are a judge.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) did it all herself.
<p/>Quite wonderful how she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) does her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) hair!--No hairdresser from London I think could.--Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare--and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a moment.--How
<p/>do you do? How do you do?--Very well, I thank you. This is delightful, is not it?--Where's dear Mr. Richard?--Oh! there he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is.
<p/>Don't disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How do you do, Mr. Richard?--I saw you the other day as you rode through the town--
<p/>Mrs. Otway, I protest!--and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline.--Such a host of friends!--and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur!--How do you do?
<p/>How do you all do?--Quite well, I am much obliged to you. Never better.--Don't I hear another carriage?--Who can this be?--very likely the worthy Coles.--Upon
<p/>my word, this is charming to be standing about among such friends! And such a noble fire!--I am quite roasted. No coffee, I thank you, for me--never take coffee.--A little tea if you please, sir, by and bye,--no hurry--
<p/>Frank Churchill returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) station by Emma; and as soon as Miss Bates was quiet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little way behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).--He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was thoughtful.
<p/>After a good many compliments to Jane on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself--and it was, <div class="bookquote">``How do you like my gown?--How
<p/>Oh! here it comes. Every thing so good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) were overhearing too, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) could not determine. do you like my trimming?--How
<p/>Mrs. Elton then said, <div class="bookquote">``Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do--but upon such an occasion as this, when every body's eyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons--who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour--I would not wish to be inferior to others.
<p/>has Wright done my hair?'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>--with many other relative questions, all answered with patient politeness. And I see very few pearls in the room except
<p/>mine.--So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand.--We shall see if our styles suit.--A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill.
<p/>At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could not but imagine he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had overheard his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) own praises, and did not want to hear more;--and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, till another suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctly forward.--Mr.
<p/>you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion?--I was this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us.''
<p/>I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) very well. '' Elton had just joined them, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wife was exclaiming, ``Oh! <div class="bookquote">``Jane!'' (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>--repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and displeasure.--<div class="bookquote">``That is easy--but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I suppose.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How do you like Mrs. Elton? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma in a whisper. '' Not at all. '' <div class="bookquote">``You are ungrateful.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Then changing from a frown to a smile--``No, do not tell me--I do not want to know what you mean.--Where is my father?--When are we to begin dancing?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ungrateful!--What do you mean? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' Emma could hardly understand him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seemed in an odd humour. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) walked off to find his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father, but was quickly back again with both Mr. and Mrs. Weston.
<p/>It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction.--Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had met with them in a little perplexity, which must be laid before Emma. '' And what are we to do for a proper partner for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)?'' said Mr. Weston.
<p/>Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) former promise; and boasted himself an engaged man, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) father looked his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) most perfect approbation of--and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business was to help to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) into it, which was done pretty soon.--Mr.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) will think Frank ought to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).'' Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed.
<p/>Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). It was almost enough to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) think of marrying.
<p/>Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; for though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) could not lose by the change.
<p/>Mr. Weston might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son's superior.--In spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming, and to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had so many hours of unusual festivity before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley's not dancing than by any thing else.--There
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was, among the standers-by, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) ought not to be; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) ought to be dancing,--not classing himself with the husbands, and fathers, and whist-players, who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up,--so young as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) looked!--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere, than where he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had placed himself.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) tall, firm, upright figure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men, was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes; and, excepting her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own partner, there was not
<p/>one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) moved a few steps nearer, and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner, with what natural grace, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) must have danced,
<p/>would he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) but take the trouble.--Whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) eye, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to smile; but in general he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was looking grave.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must not flatter herself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dancing, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were criticising her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) behaviour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not feel afraid.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could love a ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill better.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) seemed often observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). There was nothing like flirtation between her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) partner.
<p/>They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers. That Frank Churchill thought less of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had done, was indubitable.
<p/>Every body seemed happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this.
<p/>The ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessant attentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Of very important, very recordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings usually are.
<p/>There was one, however, which Emma thought something of.--The two last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no partner;--the only young lady sitting down;--and
<p/>so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers, that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder!--But Emma's wonder lessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided: she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would not--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) every moment to escape into the card-room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) came to the part of the room where the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in front of them, as if to shew his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) liberty, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) resolution of maintaining it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith, or speaking to those who were close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>).--Emma saw it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not yet dancing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was working her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) way up from the bottom, and had therefore leisure to look around, and by only turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head a little she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw it all.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would no longer allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes to watch; but Mr. Elton was so near, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) and Mrs. Weston; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) perceived that his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wife, who was standing immediately above her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), was not only listening also, but even encouraging him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) by significant glances.--The kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) seat to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) and say, <div class="bookquote">``Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) prompt reply was, <div class="bookquote">``Most readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Escape, however, was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) plan. '' Me!--oh! no--I would get you a better partner than myself. I am no dancer.
<p/>If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I shall have great pleasure, I am sure--for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert.
<p/>Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing--Miss Smith.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>had not observed.--You are extremely obliging--and if I were not an old married man.--But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston.
<p/>'' '' '' '' '' Miss Smith!--oh!--I You will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happy to do, at your command--but my dancing days are over.
<p/>Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must be returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seat.
<p/>the amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked round for a moment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and was arranging himself for settled conversation, while smiles of high glee passed between him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wife.
<p/>'' This was Mr. Elton! She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not look again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart was in a glow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) feared her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face might be as hot.
<p/>In another moment a happier sight caught her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>);--Mr. Knightley leading Harriet to the set!--Never had she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) been more surprized, seldom more delighted, than at that instant.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was all pleasure and gratitude, both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); and though too distant for speech, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) countenance said much, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) eye again.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) dancing proved to be just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had believed it, extremely good; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been for the cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) happy features announced.
<p/>It was not thrown away on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) bounded higher than ever, flew farther down the middle, and was in a continual course of smiles.
<p/>Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking -LRB-Emma trusted-RRB- very foolish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was quite so hardened as his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wife, though growing very like her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>);--
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) spoke some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feelings, by observing audibly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) partner, <div class="bookquote">``Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith!--Very
<p/>The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard from that moment, without interruption, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) being seated at table and taking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) spoon.
<p/>good-natured, I declare. ''  (<font color='red'><b>partner</b></font>)</div>Supper was announced. '' Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you?--Here is your tippet. Mrs. Weston begs you to put on your tippet.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is afraid there will be draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done--One door nailed up--Quantities of matting--
<p/>My dear Jane, indeed you must. Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on!--so gratified! Excellent dancing indeed!--Yes, my dear
<p/>, I ran home, as I said I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and nobody missed me.--I set off without saying a word, just as I told you.
<p/>Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat, and backgammon.--Tea was made downstairs, biscuits and baked apples and wine before she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) came away: amazing luck in some of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) throws: and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) inquired a great deal about you, how you were amused, and who were your partners. '
<p/>Oh!' said I, 'I shall not forestall Jane; I left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) dancing with Mr. George Otway; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) will love to tell you all about it herself to-morrow: her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) first partner was Mr. Elton, I do not know who will ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.'
<p/>My dear sir, you are too obliging.--Is there nobody you would not rather?--I am not helpless. Sir, you are most kind.
<p/>Upon my word, Jane on one arm, and me on the other!--Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton,
<p/>how elegant she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) looks!--Beautiful lace!--Now we all follow in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) train. Quite the queen of the evening!--Well, here we are at the passage.
<p/>Two steps, Jane, take care of the two steps. Oh! no, there is but one. Well, I was persuaded there were two.
<p/>How very odd! I was convinced there were two, and there is but one. I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style--Candles everywhere.--I was telling you of your grandmama,
<p/>Jane,--There was a little disappointment.--The baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all out again.
<p/>so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very much concerned!--Well
<p/>Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus-- , this is brilliant! I am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing!--Such elegance and profusion!--I have seen nothing like it since--
<p/>Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere, so that Jane is not in a draught. Where I sit is of no consequence.
<p/>Oh! do you recommend this side?--Well , I am sure, Mr. Churchill--only it seems too good--but just as you please. What you direct in this house cannot be wrong.
<p/>Dear Jane, how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama? Soup too! Bless me! I should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent, and I cannot help beginning.
<p/>Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper; but, when they were all in the ballroom again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) irresistibly to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and be thanked.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was warm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) reprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness; and Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due share of censure.
<p/>'' '' They aimed at wounding more than Harriet,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). '' Emma, why is it that they are your enemies?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added, '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) may be.--To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma, that you did want him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to marry Harriet.''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) only said, <div class="bookquote">``I shall not scold you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Emma, <div class="bookquote">``and they cannot forgive me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>I leave you to your own reflections.'' <div class="bookquote">``Can you trust me with such flatterers?--Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit.--If one leads you wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it.
<p/>There is a littleness about him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) which you discovered, and which I did not: and I was fully convinced of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) being in love with Harriet.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton. It was through a series of strange blunders!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the justice to say, that you would have chosen for him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has chosen for himself.--Harriet
<p/>An unpretending, single-minded, artless girl--infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs. Elton.
<p/>'' Smith has some first-rate qualities, which Mrs. Elton is totally without. I found Harriet more conversable than I expected. ''
<p/>Emma was extremely gratified.--They were interrupted by the bustle of Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again. <div class="bookquote">``Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all doing?--Come Emma, set your companions the example.
<p/>Every body is lazy! Every body is asleep!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am ready,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``whenever I am wanted.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' Whom are you going to dance with?'' asked Mr. Knightley.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hesitated a moment, and then replied, <div class="bookquote">``With you, if you will ask me.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Will you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), offering his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) hand.
<p/>You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper.''
<p/>'' Indeed I will. <div class="bookquote">``Brother and sister! no, indeed. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER III This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable pleasure.
<p/>It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike; and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) praise of Harriet, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) concession in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) favour, was peculiarly gratifying.
<p/>The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) evening, had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) looked forward to another happy result--the cure of Harriet's infatuation.--From Harriet's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had strong hopes.
<p/>It seemed as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) eyes were suddenly opened, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the superior creature she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite.--Harriet rational, Frank Churchill not too much in love, and Mr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
<p/>The fever was over, and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy. , how very happy a summer must be before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was to be at home by the middle of the day.
<p/>Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them all to rights, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa, when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had never less expected to see together--Frank Churchill, with Harriet leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) arm--actually Harriet!--A moment sufficed to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) that something extraordinary had happened.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not to see Frank Churchill this morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did not regret it. Harriet looked white and frightened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was trying to cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).--The iron gates and the front-door
<p/>were not twenty yards asunder;--they were all three soon in the hall, and Harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away.
<p/>A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered, and surprizes be explained. Such events are very interesting, but the suspense of them cannot last long.
<p/>Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs. Goddard's, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, and taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public enough for safety, had led them into alarm.--About half a mile beyond Highbury, making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side, it became for a considerable stretch very retired; and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it, they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them, on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a party of gipsies.
<p/>A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and Miss Bickerton, excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling on Harriet to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at the top, and made the best of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) way by a short cut back to Highbury.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had suffered very much from cramp after dancing, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) absolutely powerless--and in this state, and exceedingly terrified, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been obliged to remain.
<p/>How the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been more courageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children, headed by a stout woman and a great boy,
<p/>all clamorous, and impertinent in look, though not absolutely in word.--More and more frightened, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) immediately promised them money, and taking out her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) purse, gave them a shilling, and begged them not to want more, or to use her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
<p/>ill.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was then able to walk, though but slowly, and was moving away--but her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) terror and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) purse were too tempting, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was followed, or rather surrounded, by the whole gang, demanding more.
<p/>A few minutes made Emma acquainted with the whole. But poor Harriet could not follow. In this state Frank Churchill had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) trembling and conditioning, they loud and insolent.
<p/>By a most fortunate chance his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) assistance at this critical moment.
<p/>The pleasantness of the morning had induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to walk forward, and leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) horses to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) by another road, a mile or two beyond Highbury--and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to restore them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been obliged to stop at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) door, and go in for a few minutes: he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was therefore later than he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had intended; and being on foot, was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had left them completely frightened; and Harriet eagerly clinging to him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), and hardly able to speak, had just strength enough to reach Hartfield, before her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) spirits were quite overcome.
<p/>The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then their own portion. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) idea to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to Hartfield: he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had thought of no other place.
<p/>This was the amount of the whole story,--of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) communication and of Harriet's as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) senses and speech.--He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dared not stay longer than to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) well; these several delays left him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) not another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) safety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) set off, with all the grateful blessings that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could utter for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend and herself.
<p/>Such an adventure as this,--a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain.
<p/>Could a linguist, could a grammarian, could even a mathematician have seen what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did, have witnessed their appearance together, and heard their history of it, without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other?--How much more must an imaginist, like herself, be on fire with speculation and foresight!--especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind had already made.
<p/>Nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) memory; no rencontre, no alarm of the kind;--and now it had happened to the very person, and at the very hour, when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!--It certainly was very extraordinary!--And knowing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did, the favourable state of mind of each at this period, it struck her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the more.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was wishing to get the better of his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) attachment to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) just recovering from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mania for Mr. Elton.
<p/>So Emma thought, at least. It was a very extraordinary thing! It seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences.
<p/>In the few minutes' conversation which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had yet had with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), while Harriet had been partially insensible, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) terror, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) naivete, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) fervour as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) seized and clung to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) arm, with a sensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet's own account had been given, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) indignation at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms.
<p/>It was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other. Every thing was to take its natural course, however, neither impelled nor assisted.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bickerton</b></font>) would not stir a step, nor drop a hint. No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bickerton</b></font>) had had enough of interference. There could be no harm in a scheme, a mere passive scheme.
<p/>Emma's first resolution was to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father from the knowledge of what had passed,--aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soon felt that concealment must be impossible.
<p/>It was no more than a wish. Beyond it she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would on no account proceed. Within half an hour it was known all over Highbury.
<p/>It was the very event to engage those who talk most, the young and the low; and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news.
<p/>Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) sat, and, as Emma had foreseen, would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again.
<p/>It was some comfort to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse -LRB-for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) neighbours knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) loved to be inquired after-RRB-, as well as Miss Smith, were coming in during the rest of the day; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had the pleasure of returning for answer, that they were all very indifferent--which, though not exactly true, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was perfectly well,
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not invent illnesses for her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could make no figure in a message.
<p/>The last night's ball seemed lost in the gipsies. and Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with. The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took themselves off in a hurry.
<p/>The young ladies of Highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nephews:--in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) imagination it maintained its ground, and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the gipsies, and still tenaciously setting her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) right if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) varied in the slightest particular from the original recital.
<p/>A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand, and after sitting down and hesitating, thus began: <div class="bookquote">``Miss Woodhouse--if you are at leisure--I have something that I should like to tell you--a sort of confession to make--and then, you know, it will be over.
<p/>There was a seriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), quite as much as her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) words, for something more than ordinary.
<p/>It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``to have no reserves with you on this subject.
<p/>As I am happily quite an altered creature in one respect , it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it.
<p/>I do not want to say more than is necessary--I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and I dare say you understand me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER IV '' Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to speak. '' '' Yes,'' said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``I hope I do.
<p/>I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) now.--I do not care whether I meet him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) or not--except that of the two I had rather not see him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)--and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)--but I do not envy his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wife in the least
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How I could so long a time be fancying myself!... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Harriet, warmly. '' It seems like madness! ; I neither admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) nor envy her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), as I have done: she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is very charming,
<p/>--I shall never forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) look the other night!--However, I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, I wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) no evil.--No, let them be ever so happy together, it will not give me another moment's pang: and to convince you that I have been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy--what I ought to have destroyed long ago--what I ought never to have kept
<p/>--I know that very well -LRB-blushing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) spoke-RRB-.--However, now I will destroy it all--and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence, that you may see how rational I am grown.
<p/>I dare say, and all that, but I think her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) very ill-tempered and disagreeable Cannot you guess what this parcel holds?'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), with a conscious look.
<p/>'' Not the least in the world.--Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) ever give you any thing?'' '' No--I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have valued very much.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) held the parcel towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), and Emma read the words Most precious treasures on the top. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) curiosity was greatly excited.
<p/>Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box, which Harriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but, excepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.
<p/>Harriet unfolded the parcel, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) looked on with impatience. '' Now,'' said Harriet, <div class="bookquote">``you must recollect. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>'' No, indeed I do not.
<p/>I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very last times we ever met in it!--It was but
<p/>a very few days before I had my sore throat--just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came--I think the very evening.--Do not you remember his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cutting his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) finger with your new penknife, and your recommending court-plaister?--But, as you had none about you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); and so I took mine out and cut him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) a piece; but it was a great deal too large, and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left, before he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gave it back to me.
<p/>And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help making a treasure of it--so I put it by never to be used, and looked at it now and then as a great treat.''
<p/>'' cried Emma, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face, and jumping up, <div class="bookquote">``you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear.
<p/>Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving this relic--I knew nothing of that till this moment--but the cutting the finger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none about me!--Oh!
<p/>my sins, my sins!--And I had plenty all the while in my pocket!--One of my senseless tricks!--I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life.--Well---LRB-sitting down again-RRB---go on--what else?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' Dear me! '' My dearest Harriet! Remember it? '' And had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never suspected it, you did it so naturally.''
<p/>And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sake!'' said Emma, recovering from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement.
<p/>when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>resumed Harriet, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) box again, <div class="bookquote">``here is something still more valuable, I mean that has been more valuable, because this is what did really once belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), which the court-plaister never did.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>And secretly she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) added to herself, <div class="bookquote">``Lord bless me! I never was equal to this.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure.
<p/>It was the end of an old pencil,--the part without any lead. '' This was really his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>),'' said Harriet.--<div class="bookquote">``Do not you remember one morning?--no, I dare say you do not.
<p/>But one morning--I forget exactly the day--but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before that evening , he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wanted to make a memorandum in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) pocket-book; it was about spruce-beer.
<p/>Mr. Knightley had been telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) something about brewing spruce-beer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wanted to put it down; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) pencil, there was so little lead that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) soon cut it all away, and it would not do
<p/>But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I dared, caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>, so you lent him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) another, and this was left upon the table as good for nothing. <div class="bookquote">``I do remember it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma; <div class="bookquote">``I perfectly remember it.--Talking about spruce-beer.--Oh!
<p/>yes-- Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to like it too.
<p/>I perfectly remember it.--Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here, was not he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)? I have an idea he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was standing just here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect.--It is very odd, but I cannot recollect.--Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much about where I am now.'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--
<p/>I have nothing more to shew you, or to say--except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to see me do it.
<p/>'' Well, go on. '' '' Oh! that's all. '' '' My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, simpleton as I was!--but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them.
<p/>It was very wrong of me, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was married. I knew it was--but had not resolution enough to part with them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister?--I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be useful.''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I shall be happier to burn it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>replied Harriet. '' It has a disagreeable look to me. I must get rid of every thing.--There it goes, and there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton.''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had told no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's.--About a fortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and quite undesignedly.
<p/>'' And when,'' thought Emma, <div class="bookquote">``will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which made the information she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) received more valuable.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) merely said, in the course of some trivial chat, <div class="bookquote">``Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>--and thought no more of it, till after a minute's silence she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) heard Harriet say in a very serious tone, ``I shall never marry.
<p/>Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a moment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied, <div class="bookquote">``Never marry!--This is a new resolution.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``It is one that I shall never change, however. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>After another short hesitation, <div class="bookquote">``I hope it does not proceed from--I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Elton indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Harriet indignantly.--<div class="bookquote">``Oh! no'' (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>--and Emma could just catch the words, <div class="bookquote">``so superior to Mr. Elton! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) then took a longer time for consideration.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing?--Perhaps Harriet might think her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) cold or angry if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did; or perhaps if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) were totally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to hear too much; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been, such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was perfectly resolved.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) believed it would be wiser for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to say and know at once, all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) meant to say and know.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had previously determined how far she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would proceed, on any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to have the judicious law of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own brain laid down with speed.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was decided, and thus spoke-- <div class="bookquote">``Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning.
<p/>Your resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you.
<p/>Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) proceed no farther?--should Plain dealing was always best. Is not it so?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose--
<p/>mad.--But it is a pleasure to me to admire him (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) at a distance--and to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) infinite superiority to all the rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so proper, in me especially.
<p/>Indeed I am not so '' <div class="bookquote">``I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) rendered you was enough to warm your heart.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>it was such an inexpressible obligation!--The very recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time--when I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) coming--his (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) noble look--and my wretchedness before.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Service! oh! Such a change! In one moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is very natural.
<p/>It is natural, and it is honourable.--Yes, honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully.--But that it will be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise.
<p/>I do not advise you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means engage for its being returned.
<p/>Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can: at any rate do not let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) liking you.
<p/>Consider what you are about. Be observant of him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>). Let his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) behaviour be the guide of your sensations. I give you this caution now, because I shall never speak to you again on the subject.
<p/>We were very wrong before; we will be cautious now.--He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is your superior, no doubt, and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature; but yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have been matches of greater disparity.
<p/>I am determined against all interference. Henceforward I know nothing of the matter. Let no name ever pass our lips. But take care of yourself.
<p/>I would not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured your raising your thoughts to him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) , is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>Harriet kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend.
<p/>Its tendency would be to raise and refine her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind--and it must be saving her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) from the danger of degradation. CHAPTER V
<p/>In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened upon Hartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material change.
<p/>The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of the use to be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) grandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was likely to remain there full two months longer, provided at least she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) were able to defeat Mrs. Elton's activity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) service, and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) will.
<p/>Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing to dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) more.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) began to suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) of some double dealing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) pursuit of Emma. That Emma was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) object appeared indisputable.
<p/>Every thing declared it; his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own attentions, his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's hints, his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) mother-in-law's guarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct, discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story.
<p/>But while so many were devoting him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to Emma, and Emma herself making him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley began to suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not understand it; but there were symptoms of intelligence between them--he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) thought so at least--symptoms of admiration on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) side, which, having once observed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning, however he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) might wish to escape any of Emma's errors of imagination.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was dining with the Randalls family, and Jane, at the Eltons'; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had seen a look, more than a single look, at Miss Fairfax, which, from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) was again in their company, he (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) could not help remembering what he (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) had seen; nor could he (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) avoid observations which, unless it were like Cowper and his (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) fire at twilight, <div class="bookquote">``Myself creating what I saw,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>brought him (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking, of private understanding even, between Frank Churchill and Jane.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was not present when the suspicion first arose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had walked up one day after dinner, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) very often did, to spend his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) evening at Hartfield.
<p/>Emma and Harriet were going to walk; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) joined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who, like themselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as the weather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son, Miss Bates and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece, who had accidentally met.
<p/>They all united; and, on reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>The Randalls party agreed to it immediately; and after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, which few persons listened to, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse's most obliging invitation.
<p/>By the bye,'' said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently, <div class="bookquote">``what became of Mr. Perry's plan of setting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) carriage?
<p/>As they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback. The gentlemen spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) horse. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, <div class="bookquote">``I did not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) ever had any such plan.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nay, I had it from you.

<p/>Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and was extremely happy about it. You must remember it now?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment.''

<p/>Is Perry going to set up his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) carriage, Frank? I am glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) can afford it. You had it from himself, had you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>No, sir,'' replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) son, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``I seem to have had it from nobody.--Very odd!--I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's having mentioned it in one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with all these particulars--but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) declares she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) never heard a syllable of it before, of course it must have been a dream.
<p/>I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away--and when I have gone through my particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry.''

Perry's setting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) carriage! and his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) wife's persuading him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) to it, out of care for his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) health--just what will happen
<p/>, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a little premature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream!
<p/>And at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had hurried on before her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) guests to prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of Mr. Weston's hint.
<p/>Why, to own the truth,'' cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes, <div class="bookquote">``if I must speak on this subject, there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have--I do not mean to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) did not dream it--I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world--but if I am questioned about it, I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves--but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only thought of about three days.
<p/>Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Coles</b></font>) should have a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had prevailed.
<p/>Emma, you are a great dreamer, I think? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>Emma was out of hearing. '' Jane, don't you remember grandmama's telling us of it when we got home?
<p/>Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother--indeed I do not know who is not--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had mentioned it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) in confidence; she (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had no objection to her (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) telling us, of course, but it was not to go beyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of.
<p/>At the same time, I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware.
<p/>I forget where we had been walking to--very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to Randalls. I am a talker, you know
<p/>; I am rather a talker; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not.
<p/>I am not like Jane; I wish I were. I will answer for it she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) never betrayed the least thing in the world.
<p/>Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)?--Oh! just behind. Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry's coming.--Extraordinary dream, indeed! '' They were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded Miss Bates's in a glance at Jane.
<p/>From Frank Churchill's face, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had involuntarily turned to hers; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was indeed behind, and too busy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) shawl.
<p/>Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) eye--he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seemed watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) intently--in vain, however, if it were so--
<p/>Mr. Weston had walked in. The two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) pass. Jane passed between them into the hall, and looked at neither.
<p/>The dream must be borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield, and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke, on which two of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daily meals had, for forty years been crowded.
<p/>There was no time for farther remark or explanation. Tea passed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move. ''
<p/>Miss Woodhouse,'' said Frank Churchill, after examining a table behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), which he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could reach as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) sat, <div class="bookquote">``have your nephews taken away their alphabets--their box of letters?
<p/>It used to stand here. Where is it? This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer.
<p/>Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves.
<p/>We had great amusement with those letters one morning. I want to puzzle you again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They were rapidly forming words for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled.
<p/>The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse, who had often been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure of the <div class="bookquote">``poor little boys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>or in fondly pointing out, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) took up any stray letter near him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), how beautifully Emma had written it.
<p/>Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave a slight glance round the table, and applied herself to it.
<p/>Frank was next to Emma, Jane opposite to them--and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them all; and it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) object to see as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could, with as little apparent observation.
<p/>If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and buried from sight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) should have looked on the table instead of looking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after every fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to work.
<p/>The word was discovered, and with a faint smile pushed away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) for help.
<p/>The word was blunder ; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there was a blush on Jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible.
<p/>Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it could all be, was beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) comprehension. How the delicacy, the discretion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) favourite could have been so lain asleep!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) feared there must be some decided involvement. Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) at every turn. These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick.
<p/>With great indignation did he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) continue to observe him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); with great alarm and distrust, to observe also his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) two blinded companions.
<p/>It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank Churchill's part. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) saw a short word prepared for Emma, and given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with a look sly and demure.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly entertaining, though it was something which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) judged it proper to appear to censure; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! for shame!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane, <div class="bookquote">``I will give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)--shall I?'' (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Jane Fairfax</b></font>)</div>--and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth.
<p/>This gallant young man, who seemed to love without feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to study it.
<p/>Mr. Knightley's excessive curiosity to know what this word might be, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seize every possible moment for darting his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) eye towards it, and it was not long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) saw it to be Dixon .
<p/>Jane Fairfax's perception seemed to accompany his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of those five letters so arranged.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed more deeply than he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had ever perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), and saying only, <div class="bookquote">``I did not know that proper names were allowed,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered.
<p/>'' No, no, you must not; you shall not, indeed. '' It was done however. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) face was averted from those who had made the attack, and turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) aunt.
<p/>Aye, very true, my dear,'' cried the latter, though Jane had not spoken a word--<div class="bookquote">``I was just going to say the same thing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Jane Fairfax</b></font>)</div>It is time for us to be going indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking for us.
<p/>My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wish you good night. '' Jane's alertness in moving, proved her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) as ready as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) aunt had preconceived.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table; but so many were also moving, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could not get away; and Mr. Knightley thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), and resolutely swept away by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) unexamined.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was afterwards looking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) shawl--Frank Churchill was looking also--it was growing dusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted, Mr. Knightley could not tell.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) thoughts full of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) observations, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) must--yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) certainly must, as a friend--an anxious friend--give Emma some hint, ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) some question.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) duty. ''
<p/>Pray, Emma,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``may I ask in what lay the great amusement, the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax?
<p/>I saw the word, and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one, and so very distressing to the other.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not endure to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) the true explanation; for though her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) suspicions were by no means removed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was really ashamed of having ever imparted them.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Emma was extremely confused. '' Oh! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried in evident embarrassment, <div class="bookquote">``it all meant nothing; a mere joke among ourselves.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The joke,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) replied gravely, <div class="bookquote">``seemed confined to you and Mr. Churchill. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would speak again, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would rather busy herself about any thing than speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) sat a little while in doubt. A variety of evils crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) mind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) owed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference, rather than her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) welfare; to encounter any thing, rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause.
<p/>My dear Emma,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) at last, with earnest kindness, <div class="bookquote">``do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Interference--fruitless interference. Emma's confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed to declare her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) affection engaged. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) would speak. '' '' Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax?
<p/>Oh! yes, perfectly.--Why do you make a doubt of it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Have you never at any time had reason to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), or that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried with a most open eagerness--``Never, for the twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them--certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be public.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander--but it will not do--very sorry to check you in your first essay--but indeed it will not do.
<p/>There is no admiration between them, I do assure you; and the appearances which have caught you, have arisen from some peculiar circumstances--feelings rather of a totally different nature--it is impossible exactly to explain:--there is a good deal of nonsense in it--but the part which is capable of being communicated, which is sense, is, that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another, as any two beings in the world can be.
<p/>That is, I presume it to be so on her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) side, and I can answer for its being so on his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never, never! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And how could it possibly come into your head?'' '' Oh! you amuse me excessively. I will answer for the gentleman's indifference.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was in gay spirits, and would have prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) suspicions, every look described, and all the
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction which silenced, Mr. Knightley. wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>): but his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) gaiety did not meet hers.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) might not be irritated into an absolute fever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse's tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) soon afterwards took a hasty leave, and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey.
<p/>After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs. Suckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could not be useful, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) feelings were too much irritated for talking. CHAPTER VI No such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present.
<p/>In the daily interchange of news, they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings' coming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill, whose health seemed every day to supply a different report, and the situation of Mrs. Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child, as that of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) neighbours was by the approach of it.
<p/>Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed. It was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) introductions and recommendations must all wait, and every projected party be still only talked of.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) thought at first;--but a little consideration convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) that every thing need not be put off. Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come?
<p/>They could go there again with them in the autumn. It was settled that they should go to Box Hill. That there was
<p/>Emma had never been to Box Hill; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and Mr. Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither.
<p/>Two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be done in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings.
<p/>This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could not but feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from Mr. Weston that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) brother and sister had failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), that the two parties should unite, and go together; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it, so it was to be, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had no objection.
<p/>Now, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) objection was nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) very great dislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly aware, it was not worth bringing forward again:--it could not be done without a reproof to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), which would be giving pain to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife; and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would probably expose her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs. Elton's party!
<p/>Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston's temper.
<p/>to be such a party had been long generally known: it had even given the idea of another. '' I am glad you approve of what I have done,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) very comfortably.
<p/>'' But I thought you would. Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers. One cannot have too large a party.
<p/>A large party secures its own amusement. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is a good-natured woman after all. One could not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) out.
<p/>It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton was growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty.
<p/>It might be weeks, it might be only a few days, before the horse were useable; but no preparations could be ventured on, and it was all melancholy stagnation.
<p/>'' Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private. Mrs. Elton's resources were inadequate to such an attack.
<p/>'' Is not this most vexatious, Knightley? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) cried.--<div class="bookquote">``And such weather for exploring!--These delays and disappointments are quite odious. What are we to do?--The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing done.
<p/>Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div><p/>'' You had better explore to Donwell,'' replied Mr. Knightley. '' That may be done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries.
<p/>If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was obliged to proceed so, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) proposal was caught at with delight; and the <div class="bookquote">``Oh!
<p/>Donwell was famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation: but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) again and again to come--much oftener than he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) doubted--and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chose to consider it.
<p/>They are ripening fast. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I should like it of all things,'' was not plainer in words than manner. '' You may depend upon me,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot name a day,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' I certainly will come. Name your day, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh! leave all that to me.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hope you will bring Elton,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>):
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! now you are looking very sly. But consider--you need not be afraid of delegating power to me .
<p/>I am no young lady on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) preferment. Married women, you know, may be safely authorised. It is my party. Leave it all to me.
<p/>calmly replied,--<div class="bookquote">``there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pleases to Donwell, and that one is--
<p/>I will invite your guests.''

'' No --Mrs. Knightley;--and till she (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is in being, I will manage such matters myself.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you are an odd creature! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) cried, satisfied to have no one preferred to herself.--<div class="bookquote">``You are a humourist, and may say what you like.
<p/>Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me--Jane and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) aunt.--The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meeting the Hartfield family.
<p/>Don't scruple. I know you are attached to them.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home.''

<p/>I shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm. Here,--probably this basket with pink ribbon.
<p/>Nothing can be more simple, you see. And Jane will have such another. There is to be no form or parade--a sort of gipsy party.
<p/>We are to walk about your gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves, and sit under trees;--and whatever else you may like to provide, it is to be all out of doors--a table spread in the shade, you know.
<p/>Every thing as natural and simple as possible. Is not that your idea? '' <div class="bookquote">``Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining-room.

<p/>And, by the bye, can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion?--Pray be sincere, Knightley.

<p/>You have hit upon the very thing to please me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) ill.
<p/>Mr. Woodhouse must not, under the specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at Donwell, be tempted away to his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) misery.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was invited on good faith. No lurking horrors were to upbraid him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) easy credulity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) did consent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had not been at Donwell for two years.
<p/>Some very fine morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), and Emma, and Harriet, could go very well; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the dear girls walked about the gardens.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) should like to see the old house again exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and any other of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) neighbours.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could not see any objection at all to his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), and Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine morning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them--very kind and sensible--much cleverer than dining out.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was not fond of dining out.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) did not suppose they could be damp now, in the middle of the day. '' Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready concurrence.
<p/>The invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves.--Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over to join them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with.--Mr.
<p/>Knightley was then obliged to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) should be glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in writing, and spare no arguments to induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to come.
<p/>In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to Box Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell was settled for one day, and Box Hill for the next,--the weather appearing exactly right.
<p/>Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse was safely conveyed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) carriage, with one window down, to partake of this al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the Abbey, especially prepared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) by a fire all the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was happily placed, quite at his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not to heat themselves.--Mrs.
<p/>Weston, who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), remained, when all the others were invited or persuaded out, his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) patient listener and sympathiser.
<p/>It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was satisfied of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's comfort, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was glad to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and look around her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); eager to refresh and correct her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) memory with more particular observation, more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) family.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt all the honest pride and complacency which her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) viewed the respectable size and style of the building, its suitable, becoming, characteristic situation, low and sheltered--its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of which the Abbey, with all the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely a sight--and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues, which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up.--The house was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike it, covering a good deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many comfortable, and one or two handsome rooms.--It was just what it ought to be, and it looked what it was--and Emma felt an increasing respect for it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility, untainted in blood and understanding.--Some faults of temper John Knightley had; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably.
<p/>These were pleasant feelings, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did, and collect round the strawberry-beds.--The whole party were assembled, excepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs. Elton, in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) apparatus of happiness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) large bonnet and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or talking--strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or spoken of.--<div class="bookquote">``The best fruit in England--every body's favourite--
<p/>the finest beds and finest sorts.--Delightful to gather for one's self--the only way of really enjoying them.--Morning decidedly the best time--
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had given them neither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise a blush. always wholesome.--These never tired--every sort good--hautboy infinitely superior--no comparison--the others hardly eatable--
<p/>price of strawberries in London--abundance about Bristol--Maple Grove--cultivation--beds when to be renewed--gardeners thinking exactly different--no general rule--gardeners never to be put out of their way--delicious fruit--only too rich to be eaten much of--inferior to cherries--currants more refreshing--only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping--glaring sun--tired to death--could bear it no longer--must go and sit in the shade.
<p/>Such, for half an hour, was the conversation--interrupted only once by Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) solicitude after her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son-in-law, to inquire if he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) were come--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was a little uneasy.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)
<p/>Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of.--A situation, a most desirable situation, was in question.
<p/>hautboys very scarce-- Chili preferred--white wood finest flavour of all-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>had some fears of his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) horse. Mrs. Elton had received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures.
<p/>it fell short only of them: it was with a cousin of Mrs. Bragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady known at Maple Grove.
<p/>It was not with Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge, but in felicity and splendour Delightful, charming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks, every thing--and
<p/>Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately.--On her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) positively refused to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) friend's negative, though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would not at present engage in any thing, repeating the same motives which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had been heard to urge before.--Still
<p/>Jane could bear it at all, was astonishing to Emma.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did look vexed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did speak pointedly--and at last, with a decision of action unusual to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), proposed a removal.--<div class="bookquote">``Should not they walk?
<p/>Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens--all the gardens?--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished to see the whole extent.'' (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>--The pertinacity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend seemed more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could bear.
<p/>It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered, dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds.--It led to nothing; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars, which seemed intended, in their erection, to give the appearance of an approach to the house, which never had been there.
<p/>Disputable, however, as might be the taste of such a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and the view which closed it extremely
<p/>pretty.--The considerable slope, at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood;--and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered, rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river making a close and handsome curve around it.
<p/>Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow's post.--How It was a sweet view--sweet to the eye and the mind.
<p/>In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; and towards this view she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way.
<p/>Mr. Knightley and Harriet!--It was an odd tete-a-tete; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was glad to see it.--There had been a time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would have scorned her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) as a companion, and turned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with little ceremony.
<p/>There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feared it not.
<p/>It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in blossom, and light column of smoke ascending.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) joined them at the wall, and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around.
<p/>English verdure, English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, without being oppressive. Now they seemed in pleasant conversation. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc.
<p/>and Emma received a smile which seemed to say, <div class="bookquote">``These are my own concerns. I have a right to talk on such subjects, without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin.'' (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>).
<p/>a few turns together along the walk.--The shade was most refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day.
<p/>The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat;--and they were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did not come.
<p/>It was too old a story.--Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet.--They took Mrs. Weston looked, and looked in vain.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) father would not own himself uneasy, and laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) fears; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could not be cured of wishing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) would part with his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) black mare.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had expressed himself as to coming, with more than common certainty. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) aunt was so much better, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had not a doubt of getting over to them.''--Mrs.
<p/>Churchill's state, however, as many were ready to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew in the most reasonable dependence--and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to say, that it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) was prevented coming.--Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.
<p/>The cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as far as the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or, at any rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and growing cool again.--Mr.
<p/>Woodhouse, who had already taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) little round in the highest part of the gardens, where no damps from the river were imagined even by him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), stirred no more; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter resolved to remain with him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), that Mrs. Weston might be persuaded away by her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) husband to the exercise and variety which her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) spirits seemed to need.
<p/>Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals, shells, and every other family collection within his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cabinets, had been prepared for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) old friend, to while away the morning; and the kindness had perfectly answered.
<p/>Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and now he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would shew them all to Emma;--fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child, than in a total want of taste for what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) saw, for he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was slow, constant, and methodical.--Before this second looking over was begun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments' free observation of the entrance and ground-plot of the house--and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared, coming quickly in from the garden, and with a look of escape.--Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was in quest of.
<p/>Will you be so kind,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``when I am missed, as to say that I am gone home?--I am going this moment.--My aunt is not aware how late it is, nor how long we have been absent--but I am sure we shall be wanted, and I am determined to go directly.--I have said nothing about it to any body.
<p/>Mr. Knightley had done all in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) power for Mr. Woodhouse's entertainment. Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It would only be giving trouble and distress.
<p/>Till they all come in I shall not be missed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that I am gone?''
<p/>Some are gone to the ponds, and some to the lime walk. '' Certainly, if you wish it;--but you are not going to walk to Highbury alone?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes--what should hurt me?--I walk fast. I shall be at home in twenty minutes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, thank you--but on no account.--I would rather walk.--And for me to be afraid of walking alone!--I, who may so soon have to guard others!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied, <div class="bookquote">``That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now.
<p/>Let my father's servant go with you.--Let me order the carriage. It can be round in five minutes.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>I must order the carriage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) answered--<div class="bookquote">``I am fatigued; but it is not the sort of fatigue--quick walking will refresh me.--Miss Woodhouse, we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits.
<p/>The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let me have my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary.
<p/>The heat even would be danger.--You are fatigued already. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mine, I confess, are exhausted. '' Emma had not another word to oppose.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw it all; and entering into her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feelings, promoted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quitting the house immediately, and watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) safely off with the zeal of a friend.
<p/>Miss Woodhouse, the comfort of being sometimes alone!''--seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), even towards some of those who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) best.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) parting look was grateful--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) parting words, <div class="bookquote">``Oh! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!'' said Emma, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) turned back into the hall again.
<p/>'' I do pity you. And the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors, the more I shall like you.
<p/>Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only accomplished some views of St. Mark's Place, Venice, when Frank Churchill entered the room.
<p/>Emma had not been thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had forgotten to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was very glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>).
<p/>'' Mrs. Weston would be at ease. The black mare was blameless; they were right who had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>); a nervous seizure, which had lasted some hours--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had quite given up every thought of coming, till very late;--and
<p/>had he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) known how hot a ride he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) should have, and how late, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hurry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) must be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) should not have come at all.
<p/>The heat was excessive; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had never suffered any thing like it--almost wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had staid at home--nothing killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) like heat--he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could bear any degree of cold, etc., but heat was intolerable--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) sat down, at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of Mr. Woodhouse's fire, looking very deplorable.
<p/>'' You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,'' said Emma. '' As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again.
<p/>I could very ill be spared--but such a point had been made of my coming! You will all be going soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up.
<p/>Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill's state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour.
<p/>Such might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) constitution; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) recommended his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) taking some refreshment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would find abundance of every thing in the dining-room--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) humanely pointed out the door.
<p/>I met one as I came--Madness in such weather!--absolute madness!'' Some people were always cross when they were hot. '' No--he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) should not eat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was not hungry; it would only make him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hotter. '' In two minutes, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) relented in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own favour; and muttering something about spruce-beer, walked off.
<p/>Emma returned all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, saying in secret-- <div class="bookquote">``I am glad I have done being in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>I should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning. Harriet's sweet easy temper will not mind it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came back all the better--grown quite cool--and, with good manners, like himself--able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest in their employment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be so late.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best spirits, but seemed trying to improve them; and, at last, made himself talk nonsense very agreeably.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>They were looking over views in Swisserland. '' As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will have my sketches, some time or other, to look at--or my tour to read--or my poem.
<p/>I shall do something to expose myself.'' '' That may be--but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never go to Swisserland.
<p/>Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England.'' '' They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).
<p/>I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad. I assure you I have. I feel a strong persuasion, this morning, that I shall soon be abroad.
<p/>I am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy--I am sick of England--and would leave it to-morrow, if I could.
<p/>I ought to travel. I am tired of doing nothing. I want a change. '' <div class="bookquote">``You are sick of prosperity and indulgence.
<p/>Cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken.
<p/>I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I am thwarted in every thing material. I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. Go and eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well.
<p/>Another slice of cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water, will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No--I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my best cure. '' <div class="bookquote">``We are going to Box Hill to-morrow;--you will join us.
<p/>It is not Swisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change. You will stay, and go with us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening.'' '' But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning.''
<p/>'' No--It will not be worth while. If I come, I shall be cross. '' <div class="bookquote">``Then pray stay at Richmond.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>But if I do, I shall be crosser still. I can never bear to think of you all there without me.''
<p/>'' These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself. Chuse your own degree of crossness. I shall press you no more.
<p/>With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill; others took it very composedly; but there was a very general distress and disturbance on Miss Fairfax's disappearance being explained.
<p/>That it was time for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with a short final arrangement for the next day's scheme, they parted.
<p/>'' The rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected. Frank Churchill's little inclination to exclude himself increased so much, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) last words to Emma were, <div class="bookquote">``Well;--if
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) smiled her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from Richmond was to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) back before the following evening.
<p/>They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in favour of a pleasant party.
<p/>you wish me to stay and join the party, I will. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER VII Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in good time.
<p/>Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) niece, with the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs. Weston remained with Mr. Woodhouse.
<p/>Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency.
<p/>Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there. There was a languor, a want of spirits, a want of union, which could not be got over.
<p/>The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill.
<p/>They separated too much into parties. And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better. It seemed at first an accidental division, but it never materially varied.
<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix, and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of separation, between the other parties, too strong for any fine prospects, or any cold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to remove.
<p/>At first it was downright dulness to Emma. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had never seen Frank Churchill so silent and stupid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) said nothing worth hearing--looked without seeing--admired without intelligence--listened without knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said.
<p/>When they all sat down it was better; to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) taste a great deal better, for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) first object.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was so dull, it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable. Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).
<p/>To amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), and be agreeable in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) eyes, seemed all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) cared for--and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered, was gay and easy too, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) all the friendly encouragement, the admission to be gallant, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance; but which now, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own estimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very well describe.
<p/>They were laying themselves open to that very phrase--and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to Ireland by another.
<p/>Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity; it was rather because she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt less happy than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had expected.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) laughed because she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was disappointed; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship, admiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious, they were not winning back her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart.

<p/>Miss Bates said a great deal; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's presiding; Mr. Knightley's answer was the most distinct.
<p/>Any nonsense will serve. They shall talk. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. '' Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would like to hear what we are all thinking of?''

<p/>Here are seven of you, besides myself, -LRB-who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is pleased to say, am very entertaining already,-RRB- and she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) only demands from each of you either one thing very clever, be it prose or verse, original or repeated--or two things moderately clever--or
<p/>three things very dull indeed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) engages to laugh heartily at them all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! very well,'' exclaimed Miss Bates, <div class="bookquote">``then I need not be uneasy. '

<p/>'' Ah! ma'am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me--but you will be limited as to number--only three at once.
<p/>Miss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) manner, did not immediately catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) meaning; but, when it burst on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), it could not anger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>).
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah!--well--to be sure. Yes, I see what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) means, -LRB-turning to Mr. Knightley,-RRB- and I will try to hold my tongue.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I like your plan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Weston.
<p/>'' Agreed, agreed. I will do my best. I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon?'' <div class="bookquote">``Low, I am afraid, sir, very low,''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son;--<div class="bookquote">``but
<p/>we shall be indulgent--especially to any one who leads the way.''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``it will not reckon low. A conundrum of Mr. Weston's shall clear him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) next neighbour.
<p/>It is too much a matter of fact, but here it is.--What two letters of the alphabet are there, that express perfection?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Come, sir, pray let me hear it.'' <div class="bookquote">``I doubt its being very clever myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weston. '' '' What two letters!--express perfection!
<p/>I am sure I do not know. '' ``Ah! you will never guess. You, -LRB-to Emma-RRB-, I am certain, will never guess.--I will tell you.--M. and A.--Em-ma.--Do you understand?
<p/>It might be a very indifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it--and so did Frank and Harriet.--It did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid about it, and Mr. Knightley gravely said, <div class="bookquote">``This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston has done very well for himself; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must have knocked up every body else.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>Understanding and gratification came together. Perfection should not have come quite so soon. '' '' Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused,'' said Mrs. Elton;
<p/>'' I really cannot attempt-- I am not at all fond of the sort of thing. I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not at all pleased with.
<p/>These kind of things are very well at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out of place, in my opinion, when one is exploring about the country in summer.
<p/>I knew who it came from. An abominable puppy!--You know who I mean -LRB-nodding to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) husband-RRB-. Miss Woodhouse must excuse me.
<p/>I am not one of those who have witty things at every body's service. I do not pretend to be a wit.
<p/>I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way, but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue.
<p/>Pass us, if you please, Mr. Churchill. Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself. We have nothing clever to say--not one of us.
<p/>Yes, yes, pray pass me ,'' added her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) husband, with a sort of sneering consciousness; '' I have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse, or any other young lady.
<p/>'' An old married man--quite good for nothing. Shall we walk, Augusta?'' '' With all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot.
<p/>Come, Jane, take my other arm. '' Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off. '' Happy couple!'' said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out of hearing:--<div class="bookquote">``How
<p/>well they suit one another!--Very lucky--marrying as they did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place!--They only knew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath!
<p/>Peculiarly lucky!--for as to any real knowledge of a person's disposition that Bath, or any public place, can give--it is all nothing; there can be no knowledge.
<p/>It is only by seeing women in their own homes, among their own set, just as they always are, that you can form any just judgment.
<p/>Short of that, it is all guess and luck--and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) life!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) own confederates, spoke now. '' Such things do occur, undoubtedly.''--She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was stopped by a cough.
<p/>I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them to be very frequent.
<p/>Frank Churchill turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) to listen. '' You were speaking,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), gravely. She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) voice. '' A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise--but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards.
<p/>I would be understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute characters, -LRB-whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,-RRB- who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience, an oppression for ever.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon afterwards said, in a lively tone, <div class="bookquote">``Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever I marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Will you? -LRB-turning to Emma.-RRB- Will you chuse a wife for me?--I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you.
<p/>You provide for the family, you know, -LRB-with a smile at his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) father-RRB-. Find some body for me. I am in no hurry.
<p/>Adopt her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), educate her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).'' '' And make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) like myself.'' '' By all means, if you can. '' '' Very well.
<p/>I undertake the commission. You shall have a charming wife.'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for nothing else.
<p/>I shall go abroad for a couple of years--and when I return, I shall come to you for my wife. Remember.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>Emma was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to touch every favourite feeling. Would not Harriet be the very creature described?
<p/>Hazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) all that he (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wished. He (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might even have Harriet in his (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thoughts at the moment; who could say?
<p/>Referring the education to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) seemed to imply it. '' Now, ma'am,'' said Jane to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) aunt, <div class="bookquote">``shall we join Mrs. Elton?''
 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>'' If you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. I was ready to have gone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), but this will do just as well.
<p/>We shall soon overtake her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). There she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is--no, that's somebody else. That's one of the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).--Well, I declare--
<p/>Mr. Weston, his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young man's spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant.
<p/>Even Emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone, and quite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/>The appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight; and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart, and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) carriage first, were gladly endured, in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure.
<p/>'' They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Such another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) hoped never to be betrayed into again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said, <div class="bookquote">``Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use it.
<p/>While waiting for the carriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found Mr. Knightley by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) side. I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance.
<p/>How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) character, age, and situation?--Emma
<p/>, I had not thought it possible. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off. '' Nay, how could I help saying what I did?--Nobody could have helped it.
<p/>It was not so very bad. I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not understand me.'' <div class="bookquote">``I assure you she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt your full meaning.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) has talked of it since. I wish you could have heard how she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) talked of it--with what candour and generosity.
<p/>I wish you could have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) honouring your forbearance, in being able to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) such attentions, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was for ever receiving from yourself and your father, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) society must be so irksome.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, <div class="bookquote">``I know there is not a better creature in the world: but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>They are blended,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I acknowledge; and, were she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) prosperous, I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good.
<p/>Were she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) a woman of fortune, I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is poor; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) has sunk from the comforts she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was born to; and, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) live to old age, must probably sink more.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Were she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) your equal in situation--but, Emma, consider how far this is from being the case. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) situation should secure your compassion.
<p/>You, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had known from an infant, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had seen grow up from a period when her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) notice was an honour, to have you now, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the moment, laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), humble her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--and before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) niece, too--and before others, many of whom -LRB-certainly some ,-RRB- would be entirely guided by your treatment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).--This
<p/>is not pleasant to you, Emma--and it is very far from pleasant to me; but I must, I will,--I will tell you truths while I can; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, and trusting that you will some time or other
<p/>While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it was ready; and, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could speak again, he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in.
<p/>It was badly done, indeed! do me greater justice than you can do now. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face averted, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tongue motionless.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not been able to speak; and, on entering the carriage, sunk back for a moment overcome--then reproaching herself for having taken no leave, making no acknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference; but it was just too late.
<p/>They were combined only of anger against herself, mortification, and deep concern. He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had turned away, and the horses were in motion.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) continued to look back, but in vain; and soon, with what appeared unusual speed, they were half way down the hill, and every thing left far behind.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was vexed beyond what could have been expressed--almost beyond what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could conceal. Never had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was most forcibly struck. The truth of this representation there was no denying. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt it at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates!
<p/>How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) valued! And how suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) without saying one word of gratitude, of concurrence, of common kindness!
<p/>Time did not compose her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>). As she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) reflected more, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) seemed but to feel it more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) never had been so depressed.
<p/>There was only Harriet, who seemed not in spirits herself, fagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma felt the tears running down her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cheeks almost all the way home, without being at any trouble to check them, extraordinary as they were.
<p/>Happily it was not necessary to speak. CHAPTER VIII The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma's thoughts all the evening.
<p/>They, in their different homes, and their different ways, might be looking back on it with pleasure; but in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) view it was a morning more completely misspent, more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time, and more to be abhorred in recollection, than any she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had ever passed.
<p/>How it might be considered by the rest of the party, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not tell. A whole evening of back-gammon with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, was felicity to it.
<p/>There , indeed, lay real pleasure, for there she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty-four to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comfort; and feeling that, unmerited as might be the degree of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fond affection and confiding esteem, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) general conduct, be open to any severe reproach.
<p/>As a daughter, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was not without a heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hoped no one could have said to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``How could you be so unfeeling to your father?--I
<p/>must, I will tell you truths while I can.''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Miss Bates should never again--no, never! If attention, in future, could do away the past, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) might hope to be forgiven.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had been often remiss, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) conscience told her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) so; remiss, perhaps, more in thought than fact; scornful, ungracious. But it should be so no more.
<p/>In the warmth of true contrition, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) would call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) the very next morning, and it should be the beginning, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) side, of a regular, equal, kindly intercourse.
<p/>It was not unlikely, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) thought, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) might see Mr. Knightley in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) way; or, perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) might come in while she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) were paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) visit.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was just as determined when the morrow came, and went early, that nothing might prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had no objection.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) would not be ashamed of the appearance of the penitence, so justly and truly hers. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) eyes were towards Donwell as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) walked, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) not.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had never rejoiced at the sound before, nor ever before entered the passage, nor walked up the stairs, with any wish of giving pleasure, but in conferring obligation, or of deriving it, except in subsequent ridicule.
<p/>'' The ladies were all at home. '' There was a bustle on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) approach; a good deal of moving and talking.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) heard Miss Bates's voice, something was to be done in a hurry; the maid looked frightened and awkward; hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) would be pleased to wait a moment, and then ushered her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) in too soon.
<p/>Jane she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had a distinct glimpse of, looking extremely ill; and, before the door had shut them out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) heard Miss Bates saying, <div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear, I shall say you are laid down upon the bed, and I am sure you are ill enough.
<p/>Poor old Mrs. Bates, civil and humble as usual, looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) did not quite understand what was going on.
<p/>The aunt and niece seemed both escaping into the adjoining room. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>'' I am afraid Jane is not very well,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but I do not know
<p/>; they tell me she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is well. I dare say my daughter will be here presently, Miss Woodhouse. I hope you find a chair.
<p/>I wish Hetty had not gone. I am very little able-- Have you a chair, ma'am? Do you sit where you like?
<p/>I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) will be here presently. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Emma seriously hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had a moment's fear of Miss Bates keeping away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>).
<p/>But Miss Bates soon came--<div class="bookquote">``Very happy and obliged'' (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>--but Emma's conscience told her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before--less ease of look and manner.
<p/>A very friendly inquiry after Miss Fairfax, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) hoped, might lead the way to a return of old feelings. The touch seemed immediate.
<p/>This does not seem much like joy, indeed, in me---LRB-twinkling away a tear or two-RRB---but it will be very trying for us to part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), after having had her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) so long, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) has a dreadful headache just now, writing all the morning:--such long letters, you know, to be written to Colonel Campbell, and Mrs. Dixon.

<p/>'' Ah! Miss Woodhouse, how kind you are!--I suppose you have heard--and are come to give us joy. My dear,' said I, `you will blind yourself'--for tears were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) eyes perpetually.
<p/>It is a great change; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is amazingly fortunate--such a situation, I suppose, as no young woman before ever met with on first going out--do not think us ungrateful, Miss Woodhouse, for such surprising good fortune---LRB-again dispersing her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>)
<p/>One cannot wonder, one cannot wonder. tears-RRB---but, poor dear soul! if you were to see what a headache she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) has. When one is in great pain, you know one cannot feel any blessing quite as it may deserve.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is as low as possible. To look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), nobody would think how delighted and happy she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is to have secured such a situation.
<p/>You will excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) not coming to you--she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is not able --she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is gone into her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own room--I want her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to lie down upon the bed. '
<p/>My dear,' said I, 'I shall say you are laid down upon the bed:' but, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is not; she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is walking about the room.
<p/>But, now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) has written her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) letters, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) shall soon be well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) will be extremely sorry to miss seeing you, Miss Woodhouse, but your kindness will excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>).
<p/>You were kept waiting at the door--I was quite ashamed--but somehow there was a little bustle--for it so happened that we had not heard the knock, and till you were on the stairs, we did not know any body was coming. '
<p/>It is only Mrs. Cole,' said I, `depend upon it. Nobody else would come so early.' ' Well,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>), `it must be borne some time or other, and it may as well be now.'
<p/>I am sure you will like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>).'--'I can see nobody,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>); and up she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) got, and would go away; and that was what made us keep you waiting--and extremely sorry and ashamed we were. '
<p/>If you must go, my dear,' said I, `you must, and I will say you are laid down upon the bed.'
<p/>But then Patty came in, and said it was you. ' Oh!' said I, `it is Miss Woodhouse: '' Emma was most sincerely interested.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane; and this picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) nothing but pity; and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past, obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs. Cole or any other steady friend, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) might not bear to see herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) spoke as she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) felt, with earnest regret and solicitude--sincerely wishing that the circumstances which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) collected from Miss Bates to be now actually determined on, might be as much for Miss Fairfax's advantage and comfort as possible.
<p/>'' It must be a severe trial to them all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had understood it was to be delayed till Colonel Campbell's return.''
<p/>There was no bearing such an <div class="bookquote">``always;''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>and to break through her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) dreadful gratitude, Emma made the direct inquiry of-- <div class="bookquote">``Where--may I ask?--is Miss Fairfax going?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``So very kind! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Bates. '' But you are always kind. '' <div class="bookquote">``To a Mrs. Smallridge--charming woman--most superior--to have the charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smallridge</b></font>) three little girls--delightful children.
<p/>Impossible that any situation could be more replete with comfort; if we except, perhaps, Mrs. Suckling's own family, and Mrs. Bragge's; but Mrs. Smallridge is intimate with both, and in the very same neighbourhood:--lives only four miles from Maple Grove.
<p/>Jane will be only four miles from Maple Grove. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>'' Mrs. Elton, I suppose, has been the person to whom Miss Fairfax owes--
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would not let Jane say, `No;' for when Jane first heard of it, -LRB-it was the day before yesterday, the very morning we were at Donwell,-RRB-
<p/>when Jane first heard of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was quite decided against accepting the offer, and for the reasons you mention; exactly as you say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mind to close with nothing till Colonel Campbell's return, and nothing should induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to enter into any engagement at present--and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) told Mrs. Elton over and over again--
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, our good Mrs. Elton. The most indefatigable, true friend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would not take a denial. and I am sure I had no more idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would change her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)
<p/>It is not every body that would have stood out in such a kind way as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) did, and refuse to take Jane's answer; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) positively declared she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would not write any such denial yesterday, as Jane wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would wait--and, sure enough, yesterday evening it was all settled that Jane should go.
<p/>I had not the least idea!--Jane took Mrs. Elton aside, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) at once, that upon thinking over the advantages of Mrs. Smallridge's situation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smallridge</b></font>) had come to the resolution of accepting it.--I did not know a word of it till it was all settled.
<p/>mind!--but that good Mrs. Elton, whose judgment never fails her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), saw farther than I did. Quite a surprize to me! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You spent the evening with Mrs. Elton?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, all of us; Mrs. Elton would have us come. It was settled so, upon the hill, while we were walking about with Mr. Knightley. '
<p/>You must all spend your evening with us,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)--'I positively must have you all come.''' <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Knightley was there too, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div><p/>No, not Mr. Knightley; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) declined it from the first; and though I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would come, because Mrs. Elton declared she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) did not;--but my mother, and Jane, and I, were all there, and a very agreeable evening we had.
<p/>Such kind friends, you know, Miss Woodhouse, one must always find agreeable, though every body seemed rather fagged after the morning's party.
<p/>'' Even pleasure, you know, is fatiguing--and I cannot say that any of them seemed very much to have enjoyed it.
<p/>However, I shall always think it a very pleasant party, and feel extremely obliged to the kind friends who included me in it.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss Fairfax, I suppose, though you were not aware of it, had been making up her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) mind the whole day?''

<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse. Yes, indeed, there is every thing in the world that can make her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) happy in it.
<p/>Except the Sucklings and Bragges, there is not such another nursery establishment, so liberal and elegant, in all Mrs. Elton's acquaintance.
<p/>Mrs. Smallridge, a most delightful woman!--A style of living almost equal to Maple Grove--and as to the children, except the little Sucklings and little Bragges, there are not such elegant sweet children anywhere.
<p/>Jane will be treated with such regard and kindness!--It will be nothing but pleasure, a life of pleasure.--And her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) salary!--I really cannot venture to name her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) salary to you, Miss Woodhouse.
<p/>Even you, used as you are to great sums, would hardly believe that so much could be given to a young person like Jane.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! madam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, <div class="bookquote">``if other children are at all like what I remember to have been myself, I should think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions, dearly earned.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are so noble in your ideas!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And when is Miss Fairfax to leave you?'' <div class="bookquote">``Very soon, very soon, indeed; that's the worst of it.
<p/>So then, I try to put it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thoughts, and say, Come ma'am, do not let us think about it any more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Within a fortnight. Mrs. Smallridge is in a great hurry. My poor mother does not know how to bear it. ''
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) friends must all be sorry to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); and will not Colonel and Mrs. Campbell be sorry to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) has engaged herself before their return?''
<p/>Yes; Jane says she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is sure they will; but yet, this is such a situation as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) cannot feel herself justified in declining.
<p/>I was so astonished when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) first told me what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had been saying to Mrs. Elton, and when Mrs. Elton at the same moment came congratulating me upon it!
<p/>It was before tea--stay--no, it could not be before tea, because we were just going to cards--and yet it was before tea, because I remember thinking--Oh!
<p/>'' no , now I recollect, now I have it; something happened before tea, but not that. Mr. Elton was called out of the room before tea, old John Abdy's son wanted to speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).
<p/>Poor old John, I have a great regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was clerk to my poor father twenty-seven years; and now, poor old man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is bed-ridden, and very poorly with the rheumatic gout in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) joints--I must go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to-day; and so will Jane, I am sure, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) gets out at all.
<p/>And poor John's son came to talk to Mr. Elton about relief from the parish; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is very well to do himself, you know, being head man at the Crown, ostler, and every thing of that sort, but still he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot keep his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father without some help; and so, when Mr. Elton came back, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) told us what John ostler had been telling him (<font color='blue'><b>ostler</b></font>), and then it came out about the chaise having been sent to Randalls to take Mr. Frank Churchill to Richmond.
<p/>Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>); but as without supposing it possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr. Frank Churchill's going, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) proceeded to give them all, it was of no consequence.
<p/>What Mr. Elton had learned from the ostler on the subject, being the accumulation of the ostler's own knowledge, and the knowledge of the servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill--
<p/>which messenger, however, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill had sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) horse seeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it pass by, the boy going a good pace, and driving very steady.
<p/>There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest, and it caught Emma's attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind.
<p/>The contrast between Mrs. Churchill's importance in the world, and Jane Fairfax's, struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>); one was every thing, the other nothing--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) sat musing on the difference of woman's destiny, and quite unconscious on what her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) eyes were fixed, till roused by Miss Bates's saying, <div class="bookquote">``Aye, I see what you are thinking of, the pianoforte.
<p/>That was what happened before tea. It was after tea that Jane spoke to Mrs. Elton. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>What is to become of that?--Very true.
<p/>Poor dear Jane was talking of it just now.--`You must go,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). ' You and I must part. You will have no business here.--Let it stay, however,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>); `give it houseroom till Colonel Campbell comes back.
<p/>I shall talk about it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) will settle for me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) will help me out of all my difficulties.'--And to this day, I do believe, she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) knows not whether it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) present or his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) daughter's.
<p/>Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte; and the remembrance of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soon allowed herself to believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) visit had been long enough; and, with a repetition of every thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could venture to say of the good wishes which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) really felt, took leave.
<p/>CHAPTER IX Emma's pensive meditations, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked home, were not interrupted; but on entering the parlour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found those who must rouse her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/>Knightley immediately got up, and in a manner decidedly graver than usual, said, <div class="bookquote">``I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare, and therefore must now be gone directly.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) absence, and were sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father.--Mr. I am going to London, to spend a few days with John and Isabella.
<p/>Have you any thing to send or say, besides the `love,' which nobody carries?'' '' Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?''
<p/>'' Yes--rather--I have been thinking of it some little time. '' Emma was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had not forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) looked unlike himself.
<p/>Time, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought, would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) that they ought to be friends again. While he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stood, as if meaning to go, but not going--her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father began his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) inquiries.
<p/>how did you find my worthy old friend and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) daughter?--I dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming.
<p/>'' Well, my dear, and did you get there safely?--And Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before.
<p/>Emma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a smile, and shake of the head, which spoke much, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked at Mr. Knightley.--It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) favour, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) eyes received the truth from hers, and all that had passed of good in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feelings were at once caught and honoured.--
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was warmly gratified--and in another moment still more so, by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) part.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand;--whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not herself made the first motion
<p/>, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not say--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might, perhaps, have rather offered it--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand, pressed it, and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) lips--when, from some fancy or other, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) suddenly let it go.--Why he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) should feel such a scruple, why he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) should change his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) mind when it was all but done, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not perceive.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would have judged better, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had not stopped.--The intention, however, was indubitable; and whether it was that his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) manners had in general so little gallantry, or however else it happened, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought nothing became him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
<p/>more.--It was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), of so simple, yet so dignified a nature.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is always so attentive to them!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with a glow of regard. It spoke such perfect amity.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) left them immediately afterwards--gone in a moment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seemed more sudden than usual in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) disappearance.
<p/>Emma could not regret her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) having gone to Miss Bates, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ten minutes earlier;--it would have been a great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax's situation with Mr. Knightley.--Neither
<p/>would she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) regret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) should be going to Brunswick Square, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) knew how much his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) visit would be enjoyed--but it might have happened at a better time--and to have had longer notice of it, would have been pleasanter.--They parted thorough friends, however; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) could not be deceived as to the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) countenance, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) unfinished gallantry;--it was all done to assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had fully recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) good opinion.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had been sitting with them half an hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) found.
<p/>In the hope of diverting her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) father's thoughts from the disagreeableness of Mr. Knightley's going to London; and going so suddenly; and going on horseback, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) knew would be all very bad; Emma communicated her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) news of Jane Fairfax, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dependence on the effect was justified; it supplied a very useful check,--interested, without disturbing him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had long made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) mind to Jane Fairfax's going out as governess, and could talk of it cheerfully, but Mr. Knightley's going to London had been an unexpected blow.
<p/>It was a pity that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had not come back earlier! '' I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) is to be so comfortably settled.
<p/>Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable, and I dare say her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) acquaintance are just what they ought to be. I hope it is a dry situation, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) health will be taken good care of.
<p/>It ought to be a first object, as I am sure poor Miss Taylor's always was with me. You know, my dear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us.
<p/>And I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) will be better off in one respect, and not be induced to go away after it has been her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) home so long.
<p/>'' The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else into the background. An express arrived at Randalls to announce the death of Mrs. Churchill!
<p/>Though her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) account, she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had not lived above six-and-thirty hours after his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) return.
<p/>A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) general state, had carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) off after a short struggle.
<p/>Every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude for the surviving friends; and, in a reasonable time, curiosity to know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would be buried.
<p/>Goldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoops to folly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) has nothing to do but to die; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) stoops to be disagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame.
<p/>The great Mrs. Churchill was no more. It was felt as such things must be felt. Mrs. Churchill, after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was now spoken of with compassionate allowances.
<p/>In one point she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was fully justified. She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had never been admitted before to be seriously ill. The event acquitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints.
<p/>no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been suffering a great deal: more than any body had ever supposed--and continual pain would try the temper.
<p/>'' Poor Mrs. Churchill! It was a sad event--a great shock--with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) faults, what would Mr. Churchill do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)?
<p/>Mr. Churchill would never get over it.''--Even Mr. Weston shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) head, and looked solemn, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Ah! poor woman, who would have thought it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>and resolved, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) mourning should be as handsome as possible; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife sat sighing and moralising over her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) broad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady.
<p/>Mr. Churchill's loss would be dreadful indeed. How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. It was also a very early speculation with Emma.
<p/>The character of Mrs. Churchill, the grief of her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) husband--her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion--and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event, how benefited, how freed.
<p/>Mr. Churchill, independent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) wife, was feared by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew.
<p/>All that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form the attachment, as, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) goodwill in the cause, Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw in a moment all the possible good. Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter. Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command.
<p/>Emma was gratified, to observe such a proof in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) of strengthened character, and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance.
<p/>What ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might feel of brighter hope, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) betrayed nothing. They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill's death with mutual forbearance.
<p/>Mr. Churchill was better than could be expected; and their first removal, on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire, was to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor, to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years.
<p/>At present, there was nothing to be done for Harriet; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma's side.
<p/>It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax, whose prospects were closing, while Harriet's opened, and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished to shew her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) kindness--and with Emma it was grown into a first wish.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had scarcely a stronger regret than for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) past coldness; and the person, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been so many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted to be of use to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); wanted to shew a value for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) society, and testify respect and consideration.
<p/>Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) resolved to prevail on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to spend a day at Hartfield.
<p/>Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write;'' and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning, it appeared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was so much indisposed as to have been visited, though against her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own consent, by himself, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was suffering under severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) doubt the possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) going to Mrs. Smallridge's at the time proposed.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) health seemed for the moment completely deranged--appetite quite gone--and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms, nothing touching the pulmonary complaint, which was the standing apprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was uneasy about her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had undertaken more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was equal to, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt it so herself, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would not own it.
<p/>A note was written to urge it. The invitation was refused, and by a verbal message. '' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) spirits seemed overcome.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) present home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous disorder:--confined always to one room;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) could have wished it otherwise--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) good aunt, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) very old friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) care and attention could not be questioned; they were, in fact, only too great. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them.
<p/>Emma listened with the warmest concern; grieved for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) more and more, and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful.
<p/>To take her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--be it only an hour or two--from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) aunt, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) change of air and scene, and quiet rational conversation, even for an hour or two, might do her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) good; and the following morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wrote again to say, in the most feeling language she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could command, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would call for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name--mentioning that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had Mr. Perry's decided opinion, in favour of such exercise for his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) patient.
<p/>The answer was only in this short note: <div class="bookquote">``Miss Fairfax's compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any exercise. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own note had deserved something better; but it was impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought only of how she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted.
<p/>In spite of the answer, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ordered the carriage, and drove to Mrs. Bates's, in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)--but it would not
<p/>do;--Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service--and every thing that message could do was tried--but all in vain.
<p/>Miss Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane was quite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) worse.--Emma wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and tried her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own powers; but, almost before she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in.
<p/>Elton, indeed, could not be denied--and Mrs. Cole had made such a point--and Mrs. Perry had said so much--but, except them, Jane would really see nobody.
<p/>Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys, and the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere; neither could she (<font color='blue'><b>Coles</b></font>) feel any right of preference herself--she (<font color='blue'><b>Coles</b></font>) submitted, therefore, and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece's appetite and diet, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) longed to be able to assist.
<p/>'' Indeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body--any body at all--Mrs. '' On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy, and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any thing:--Mr.
<p/>Emma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an examination of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note.
<p/>In half an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates, but <div class="bookquote">``dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back; it was a thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could not take--and, moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) insisted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) saying, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was not at all in want of any thing.
<p/>Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing they could command -LRB-and never had any body such good neighbours-RRB- was distasteful. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon of the very day on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had, under the plea of being unequal to any exercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) in the carriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) could have no doubt--putting every thing together--that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) .
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits, inconsistency of action, and inequality of powers; and it mortified her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was given so little credit for proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthy as a friend: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had the consolation of knowing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) intentions were good, and of being able to say to herself, that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) even have seen into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would not, on this occasion, have found any thing to reprove.
<p/>One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease, Emma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who <div class="bookquote">``could not stay five minutes, and wanted particularly to speak with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>--He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at the parlour-door, and hardly asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did, in the natural key of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, <div class="bookquote">``Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning?--Do, if it be possible.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was sorry, very sorry. CHAPTER X Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must see you.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way. But what can be the matter?--Is

<p/>Something really important seemed announced by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looks; but, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) friend was well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) father, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) walk now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls.
<p/>But hush, hush!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. '' Now,''--said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates,--<div class="bookquote">``now Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' No, no,''--he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) gravely replied.--<div class="bookquote">``Don't ask me. I promised my wife to leave it all to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will break it to you better than I can.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, indeed you are mistaken.''-- <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Weston do not trifle with me.--Consider how many of my dearest friends are now in Brunswick Square.
<p/>Which of them is it?--I charge you by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, Emma.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-- <div class="bookquote">``Your word!--why not your honour!--why not say upon your honour, that it has nothing to do with any of them?
<p/>Good Heavens!--What can be to be broke to me, that does not relate to one of that family?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Upon my honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) very seriously, <div class="bookquote">``it does not.
<p/>It is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of Knightley. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Emma's courage returned, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked on.
<p/>'' I was wrong,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``in talking of its being broke to you. I should not have used the expression.
<p/>In fact, it does not concern you--it concerns only myself,--that is, we hope.--Humph!--In short, my dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it.
<p/>I don't say that it is not a disagreeable business--but things might be much worse.--If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own fancy, and that soon pointed out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the probability of its being some money concern--something just come to light, of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family,--something which the late event at Richmond had brought forward.
<p/>Half a dozen natural children, perhaps--and poor Frank cut off!--This, though very undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Emma found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must wait; and now it required little effort. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fancy was very active. It inspired little more than an animating curiosity.
<p/>Who is that gentleman on horseback?'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), as they proceeded--speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) secret, than with any other view.
<p/>'' '' I do not know.--One of the Otways.--Not Frank;--it is not Frank, I assure you. You will not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) is half way to Windsor by this time. '' <div class="bookquote">``Has your son been with you, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! yes-- did not you know?--Well, well, never mind.
<p/>For a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded and demure, ``Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.
<p/>They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls.--<div class="bookquote">``Well, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), as they entered the room--<div class="bookquote">``I have brought her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and now I hope you will soon be better.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' I shall leave you together. There is no use in delay. I shall not be far off, if you want me.''--And
<p/>Emma distinctly heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) add, in a lower tone, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) quitted the room,--``I have been as good as my word.
<p/>Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation, that Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eagerly said, <div class="bookquote">``What is it my dear friend?

<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Have you indeed no idea?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice. '' Cannot you, my dear Emma--cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are right.

<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) has been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. It is impossible to express our surprize. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) came to speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father on a subject,--to announce an attachment--
<p/>More than an attachment, indeed,'' resumed Mrs. Weston; <div class="bookquote">``an engagement--a positive engagement.--What will you say, Emma--what will any body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are engaged;--nay, that they have been long engaged!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stopped to breathe. Emma thought first of herself, and then of Harriet. '' '' Emma even jumped with surprize;--and, horror-struck, exclaimed, ''
<p/>You may well be amazed,'' returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) eyes, and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover--
<p/>Jane Fairfax!--Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean it?'' '' '' You may well be amazed. But it is even so.
<p/>There has been a solemn engagement between them ever since October--formed at Weymouth, and kept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing it
<p/>but themselves--neither the Campbells, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) family, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).--It is so wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yet almost incredible to myself.
<p/>Emma scarcely heard what was said.--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind was divided between two ideas--her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own former conversations with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) about Miss Fairfax; and poor Harriet;--and for some time she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could only exclaim, and require confirmation, repeated confirmation.
<p/>Well,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) at last, trying to recover herself; <div class="bookquote">``this is a circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at all comprehend it.
<p/>I can hardly believe it.--I thought I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' What!--engaged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) all the winter--before either of them came to Highbury?''
<p/>``Engaged since October,--secretly engaged.--It has hurt me, Emma, very much. It has hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father equally. Some part of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) conduct we cannot excuse.
<p/>Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, <div class="bookquote">``I will not pretend not to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured that no such effect has followed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) attentions to me, as you are apprehensive of.
<p/>That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my present perfect indifference,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I will farther tell you, that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when I did like him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), when I was very much disposed to be attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)--nay, was attached--and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance was as steady as her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) words. '' Fortunately, however, it did cease.
<p/>I have really for some time past, for at least these three months, cared nothing about him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>). You may believe me, Mrs. Weston.
<p/>Mrs. Weston kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) with tears of joy; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could find utterance, assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), that this protestation had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) more good than any thing else in the world could do.
<p/>This is the simple truth. '' '' Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). '' On this point we have been wretched.

<p/>What right had he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to endeavour to please, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) certainly did--to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) certainly did--while he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) really belonged to another?--How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) tell what mischief he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might be doing?--How

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told me at parting, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should soon write; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now.

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy, some time--and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) uncle, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could stay with us but a quarter of an hour.--He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was very much agitated--very much, indeed--to a degree that made him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) before.--In addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) so very unwell, which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had had no previous suspicion of--and there was every appearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) having been feeling a great deal.
<p/>And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy?--The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know of the engagement?
<p/>'' This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this morning. '' '' '' Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.
<p/>'' None; not one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves.''
<p/>'' Well,'' said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding.
<p/>What has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit,--espionage, and treachery?--To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secret to judge us
<p/>have we been, the whole winter and spring, completely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear.--They must take the consequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>I am very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other, which both might not have heard.
<p/>all!--Here <div class="bookquote">``I am quite easy on that head,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Weston. '' '' ``You are in luck.--Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady.
<p/>But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss Fairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); and as to speaking ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), there I must have been safe.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife gave him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) a look which invited him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in; and, while he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was coming round, added, <div class="bookquote">``Now, dearest Emma, let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) heart at ease, and incline him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to be satisfied with the match.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``True. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window, evidently on the watch. Let us make the best of it--and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) favour.
<p/>and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), for Frank, I mean, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) credit for--and still am disposed to give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) credit for, in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right.
<p/>It is not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that, why should we? And how much may be said in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) situation for even that error!''
<p/>If a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like Jane Fairfax's.--Of such, one may almost say, that `the world is not their's, nor the world's law.'
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) met Mr. Weston on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) entrance, with a smiling countenance, exclaiming, ``A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Much, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma feelingly. '' '' This was a device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent of guessing.
<p/>And here, instead of its being a matter of condolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation.--I congratulate you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter.
<p/>A glance or two between him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife, convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) that all was as right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) spirits was immediate.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) air and voice recovered their usual briskness: he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on the subject in a manner to prove, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence, or smooth objections; and by the time they had talked it all over together, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had talked it all over again with Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was become perfectly reconciled, and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could possibly have done.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harriet, poor Harriet!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--Those were the words; in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted the real misery of the business to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/>But you really frightened me. I thought you had lost half your property, at least. '' CHAPTER XI Frank Churchill had behaved very ill by herself--very ill in many
<p/>It was the scrape which he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had drawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) into on Harriet's account, that gave the deepest hue to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) offence.--Poor Harriet! to be a second time the dupe of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) misconceptions and flattery.
<p/>Mr. Knightley had spoken prophetically, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) once said, <div class="bookquote">``Emma, you have been no friend to Harriet Smith.'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) nothing but disservice.--It was true that she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had not to charge herself, in this instance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet's imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had ever given her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) a hint on the subject; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might have repressed.
<p/>ways,--but it was not so much his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) behaviour as her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own , which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) so angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) influence would have been enough. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was very conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ought to have prevented them.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been risking her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend's happiness on most insufficient grounds.
<p/>Common sense would have directed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to tell Harriet, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) must not allow herself to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and that there were five hundred chances to one against his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) ever caring for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).--<div class="bookquote">``But, with common sense,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I have had little to do.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful.--As for Jane Fairfax, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) might at least relieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) feelings from any present solicitude on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) account.
<p/>Harriet would be anxiety enough; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) need no longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health having, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure.--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) days of insignificance and evil were over.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would soon be well, and happy, and prosperous.--Emma could now imagine why her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own attentions had been slighted.
<p/>No doubt it had been from jealousy.--In Jane's eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had been a rival; and well might any thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed.
<p/>An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack, and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) understood it all; and as far as her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) acknowledged that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) desert.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was extremely angry with herself. This discovery laid many smaller matters open. But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge!
<p/>There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else. Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first.
<p/>Considering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet's mind, producing reserve and self-command, it would.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) must communicate the painful truth, however, and as soon as possible.
<p/>An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston's parting words. '' For the present, the whole affair was to be completely a secret.
<p/>Mr. Churchill had made a point of it, as a token of respect to the wife he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had so very recently lost; and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum.''--Emma had promised; but still Harriet must be excepted.
<p/>In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) vexation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not help feeling it almost ridiculous, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by herself.
<p/>It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) superior duty. The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was now to be anxiously announcing to another.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) heart beat quick on hearing Harriet's footstep and voice; so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) supposed, had poor Mrs. Weston felt when she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was approaching Randalls.
<p/>Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance!--But of that, unfortunately, there could be no chance. '' Well, Miss Woodhouse!
<p/>'' cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room--<div class="bookquote">``is not this the oddest news that ever was?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>'' What news do you mean?
<p/>'' replied Emma, unable to guess, by look or voice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint. '' About Jane Fairfax.
<p/>Did you ever hear any thing so strange? Oh!--you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) told me it was to be a great secret; and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body
<p/>I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) just now. but you, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) said you knew it. '' '' What did Mr. Weston tell you?''--said
<p/>Oh! he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill are to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while.
<p/>Emma, still perplexed. '' How very odd! '' It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd, that Emma did not know how to understand it.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) character appeared absolutely changed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery. Emma looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), quite unable to speak.
<p/>Had you any idea,'' cried Harriet, <div class="bookquote">``of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) being in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)?--You, perhaps, might.--You -LRB-blushing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) spoke-RRB- who can see into every body's heart; but nobody else--
<p/>Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) attached to another woman at the very time that I was--tacitly, if not openly--encouraging you to give way to your own feelings?--I never had the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank Churchill's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``I begin to doubt my having any such talent.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished. '' Why should you caution me?--You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Emma, smiling; <div class="bookquote">``but you do not mean to deny that there was a time--and not very distant either--when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)!--never, never.

<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not speak another word.--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) voice was lost; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) sat down, waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.
<p/>Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), did not immediately say any thing; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did speak, it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma's.
<p/>a moment's pause--<div class="bookquote">``What do you mean?--Good Heaven! what do you mean?--Mistake you!--Am I to suppose then?-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I should not have thought it possible,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``that you could have misunderstood me!
<p/>I know we agreed never to name him (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)--but considering how infinitely superior he (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is to every body else, I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person.
<p/>I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill, who is like nobody by his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) side.
<p/>Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed! I do not know who would ever look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) in the company of the other. And that you should have been so mistaken, is amazing!--I
<p/>am sure, but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment, I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost, to dare to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>).
<p/>At first, if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened; that there had been matches of greater disparity -LRB-those were your very words-RRB-;--I should not have dared to give way to--I should not have thought it possible--
<p/>But if you , who had been always acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Harriet!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely--<div class="bookquote">``Let us understand each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake.
<p/>Are you speaking of--Mr. Knightley? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' To be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body else--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not quite,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>returned Emma, with forced calmness, <div class="bookquote">``for all that you then said, appeared to me to relate to a different person.
<p/>and so I thought you knew. When we talked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), it was as clear as possible.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>I could almost assert that you had named Mr. Frank Churchill.
<p/>I am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from the gipsies, was spoken of.'' ''
<p/>Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!'' '' My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on the occasion.
<p/>I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment; that considering the service he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had rendered you, it was extremely natural:--and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service, and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) come forward to your rescue.--The impression of it is strong on my memory.''
<p/>Oh, dear,'' cried Harriet, <div class="bookquote">``now I recollect what you mean; but I was thinking of something very different at the time.
<p/>-LRB-with some elevation-RRB- I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance--of Mr. Knightley's coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would not stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room.
<p/>That was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was to every other being upon earth.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>'' It was not the gipsies--it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant. No! <div class="bookquote">``Good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, <div class="bookquote">``this has been a most unfortunate--most deplorable mistake!--What is to be done?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>At least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the other had been the person; and now--it is possible--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the person</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) paused a few moments. Emma could not speak.
<p/>I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) resumed, <div class="bookquote">``that you should feel a great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other. But I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing--that if--strange as it may appear--.
<p/>matches of greater disparity had taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if such a thing even as this, may have occurred before--and if I should be so fortunate, beyond expression, as to--if Mr. Knightley should really--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) does not mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will not set yourself against it, and try to put difficulties in the way.
<p/>But you know they were your own words, that more wonderful things had happened, But you are too good for that, I am sure.
<p/>Emma turned round to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in consternation, and hastily said, <div class="bookquote">``Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection?''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Harriet was standing at one of the windows. <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully--<div class="bookquote">``I must say that I have.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>Emma's eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sat silently meditating, in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes. A few minutes were sufficient for making her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own heart.
<p/>A mind like hers, once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) touched --she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) admitted--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) acknowledged the whole truth. Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with Frank Churchill?
<p/>Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet's having some hope of a return? It darted through her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself!
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own conduct, as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own heart, was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in the same few minutes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) before.
<p/>How improperly had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) been acting by Harriet! How inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) conduct! What blindness, what madness, had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) on!
<p/>Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of all these demerits--some concern for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own appearance, and a strong sense of justice by Harriet---LRB-there would be no need of compassion to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley--but justice required that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,-RRB- gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even apparent
<p/>It struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with dreadful force, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was ready to give it every bad name in the world. kindness.--For her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own advantage
<p/>indeed, it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet's hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained--or to deserve to be slighted by the person, whose counsels had never led her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) right.--Rousing from reflection, therefore, and subduing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) emotion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) turned to Harriet again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as to the subject which had first introduced it, the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost.--Neither of them thought
<p/>Harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad to be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge, and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to give the history of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) hopes with great, though trembling delight.--Emma's tremblings as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) listened, were better concealed than Harriet's, but they were not less.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) voice was not unsteady; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self, such a burst of threatening evil, such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions, must create.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) listened with much inward suffering, but with great outward patience, to Harriet's detail.--Methodical, or well arranged, or very well delivered, it could not be expected to be; but it contained, when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) spirit--especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own memory brought in favour of Mr. Knightley's most improved opinion of Harriet.
<p/>Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) behaviour ever since those two decisive dances.--Emma knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had, on that occasion, found her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) much superior to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) expectation.
<p/>From that evening, or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), Harriet had begun to be sensible of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) much more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had been used to do, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) having indeed quite a different manner towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>); a manner of kindness and sweetness!--Latterly she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been more and more aware of it.
<p/>When they had been all walking together, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had so often come and walked by her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), and talked so very delightfully!--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seemed to want to be acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).
<p/>but of Mr. Knightley and themselves. Emma knew it to have been very much the case. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had often observed the change, to almost the same extent.--Harriet
<p/>repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)--and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had known of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) opinion of Harriet.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) praised her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) for being without art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous, feelings.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) saw such recommendations in Harriet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had dwelt on them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) more than once.--Much that lived in Harriet's memory, many little particulars of the notice she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had received from him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment implied, a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected, by Emma.
<p/>Circumstances that might swell to half an hour's relation, and contained multiplied proofs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) who had seen them, had passed undiscerned by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself.--The first, was his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) walking with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) apart from the others, in the lime-walk at Donwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came, and he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had taken pains -LRB-as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was convinced-RRB- to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) from the rest to himself--and at first, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in a more particular way than he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had ever done before, in a very particular way indeed!---LRB-Harriet could not recall it without a blush.-RRB-
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) seemed to be almost asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) affections were engaged.--But as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) -LRB-Miss Woodhouse-RRB- appeared likely to join them, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) changed the subject, and began talking about farming:--The second, was his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) having sat talking with her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) visit, the very last morning of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) being at Hartfield--though, when he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) first came in, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) could not stay five minutes--and his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) having told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>), during their conversation, that though he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) must go to London, it was very much against his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) inclination that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) left home at all, which was much more -LRB-as Emma felt-RRB- than he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had acknowledged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) .
<p/>The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which this one article marked, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) severe pain. On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did, after a little reflection, venture the following question.
<p/>Might he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) not?--Is not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state of your affections, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) might be alluding to Mr. Martin--he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) might have Mr. Martin's interest in view?
<p/>'' But Harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit. '' Mr. Martin! No indeed!--There was not a hint of Mr. Martin. I hope I know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of it.
<p/>When Harriet had closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) evidence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) appealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) dear Miss Woodhouse, to say whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had not good ground for hope.
<p/>'' '' I never should have presumed to think of it at first,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), ``but for you. You told me to observe him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) carefully, and let his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) behaviour be the rule of mine--and so I have.
<p/>But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>); and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) does chuse me, it will not be any thing so very wonderful.
<p/>The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter feelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma's side, to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to say on reply, <div class="bookquote">``Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is the last man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) feeling for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) really does.
<p/>Harriet seemed ready to worship her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend for a sentence so satisfactory; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which at that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's footsteps.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not compose herself-- Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had better go;'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>--with most ready encouragement from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) passed off through another door--and the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was gone, this was the spontaneous burst of Emma's feelings:
<p/>'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was coming through the hall. Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). '' <div class="bookquote">``Oh God! that I had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thoughts.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) within the last few hours.
<p/>Every moment had brought a fresh surprize; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).--How to understand it all!
<p/>How to understand the deceptions she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been thus practising on herself, and living under!--The blunders, the blindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own head and
<p/>, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) walked about, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) tried her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) tried the shrubbery--in every place, every posture, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) perceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had acted most weakly; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was wretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness.
<p/>To that point went every leisure moment which her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father's claims on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) allowed, and every moment of involuntary absence of mind.
<p/>heart!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) sat still To understand, thoroughly understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own heart, was the first endeavour. How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), as every feeling declared him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) now to be?
<p/>When had he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) succeeded to that place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) affection, which Frank Churchill had once, for a short period, occupied?--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) looked back; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) compared the two--compared them, as they had always stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) estimation, from the time of the latter's becoming known to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)--and as they must at any time have been compared by her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), had it--oh! had it, by any blessed felicity, occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>),
<p/>to institute the comparison.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) saw that there never had been a time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did not consider Mr. Knightley as infinitely the superior, or when his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had not been infinitely the most dear.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) saw, that in persuading herself, in fancying, in acting to the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been entirely under a delusion, totally ignorant of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own heart--and, in short, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had never really cared for Frank Churchill at all!
<p/>This was the knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) reached; and without being long in reaching it.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was most sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)--her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) affection for Mr. Knightley.--Every other part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mind was disgusting.
<p/>With insufferable vanity had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) believed herself in the secret of every body's feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body's destiny.
<p/>When had his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) influence, such influence begun?-- This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was proved to have been universally mistaken; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had not quite done nothing--for she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had done mischief.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had brought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) too much feared, on Mr. Knightley.--Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) attachment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of Harriet's;--and even were this not the case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would never have known Harriet at all but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) folly.
<p/>Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith!--It was a union to distance every wonder of the kind.--The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax became commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, exciting no surprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing to be said or thought.--Mr.
<p/>It was horrible to Emma to think how it must sink him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) in the general opinion, to foresee the smiles, the sneers, the merriment it would prompt at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) expense; the mortification and disdain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) brother, the thousand inconveniences to himself.--Could it be?--No; it was impossible.
<p/>And yet it was far, very far, from impossible.--Was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers?
<p/>Was it new for one, perhaps too busy to seek, to be the prize of a girl who would seek him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?--Was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal, inconsistent, incongruous--or for chance and circumstance -LRB-as second causes-RRB- to direct the human fate?
<p/>Knightley and Harriet Smith!--Such an elevation on her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) side! Such a debasement on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)! Oh! had she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) never brought Harriet forward!
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) not, with a folly which no tongue could express, prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) happy and respectable in the line of life to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ought to belong--all would have been safe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.
<p/>Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ought, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ought!--Had How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thoughts to Mr. Knightley!--How
<p/>Harriet was less humble, had fewer scruples than formerly.--Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) inferiority, whether of mind or situation, seemed little felt.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton's being to stoop in marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) now seemed of Mr. Knightley's.--Alas!
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it!--But was not that her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own doing too?
<p/>but herself had taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was to elevate herself if possible, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) claims were great to a high worldly establishment?--If Harriet, from being humble, were grown vain
<p/>Who had been at pains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself?--Who , it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) doing too. CHAPTER XII
<p/>Till now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known how much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) happiness depended on being first with Mr. Knightley, first in interest and affection.--Satisfied that it was so, and feeling it her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) due, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had been.--Long, very long, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been first; for, having no female connexions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) own, there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had always known exactly how far he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) loved and esteemed Isabella.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had not deserved it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had often been negligent or perverse, slighting his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) advice, or even wilfully opposing him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>), insensible of half his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) merits, and quarrelling with him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) would not acknowledge her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) false and insolent estimate of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) own--but still, from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), and watched over her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) from a girl, with an endeavour to improve her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), and an anxiety for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) doing right, which no other creature had at all shared.
<p/>In spite of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) faults, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>); might she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) not say, very dear?--When the suggestions of hope, however, which must follow here
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had herself been first with him (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) for many years past. , presented themselves, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) could not presume to indulge them.
<p/>Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) .
<p/>How directly, how strongly had he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) expressed himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) on the subject!--Not too strongly for the offence--but far, far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear-sighted
<p/>goodwill.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had no hope, nothing to deserve the name of hope, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question; but there was a hope -LRB-at times a slight one, at times much stronger,-RRB- that Harriet might have deceived herself, and be overrating his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) .--Wish
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had received a very recent proof of its impartiality.--How shocked had he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) been by her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) behaviour to Miss Bates! it
<p/>Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) be secure of that, indeed, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) never marrying at all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should be perfectly satisfied.--Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) but continue the same Mr. Knightley to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father, the same Mr. Knightley to all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) peace would be fully secured.--Marriage
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) must, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) sake--be the consequence nothing to herself, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) remaining single all his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) life. , in fact, would not do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>).
<p/>It would be incompatible with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) owed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father, and with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) felt for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Nothing should separate her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father.
<p/>It must be her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hoped, that when able to see them together again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should see them henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had hitherto misunderstood even those she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was watching
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would not marry, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) were asked by Mr. Knightley. , she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did not know how to admit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could be blinded here.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was expected back every day.
<p/>In the meanwhile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) resolved against seeing Harriet.--It would do neither of them good, it would do the subject no good, to be talking of it
<p/>farther.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was resolved not to be convinced, as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could doubt, and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet's confidence.
<p/>To talk would be only to irritate.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of one topic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again, except in the company of others--she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) objected only to a tete-a-tete--they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday.--Harriet submitted, and approved, and was grateful.
<p/>This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them, sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours--Mrs.
<p/>Weston, who had been calling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) way home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.
<p/>Mr. Weston had accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) share of this essential attention most handsomely; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in an airing, was now returned with much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded.
<p/>The power of observation would be soon given--frightfully soon it appeared when her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) thoughts were in one course. A little curiosity Emma had; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) made the most of it while her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend related.
<p/>Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead, and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and Mr. Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement's becoming known; as, considering every thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports:--but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was extremely anxious to shew his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) approbation to Miss Fairfax and her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) family, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it; or if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for <div class="bookquote">``such things,''  (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) observed, <div class="bookquote">``always got about.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston had very good reason for saying so. They had gone, in short--and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action had shewn how deeply she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was suffering from consciousness.
<p/>The quiet, heart-felt satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughter--who proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene.
<p/>They were both so truly respectable in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation; thought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and so little of themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them.
<p/>Miss Fairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to an airing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had drawn back and declined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive, Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) embarrassment, as to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to converse on the important subject.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was always feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the cause; but when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement.
<p/>Mrs. Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) companion, pent up within her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own mind as every thing had so long been, and was very much pleased with all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had said on the subject.
<p/>On the misery of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had suffered, during the concealment of so many months,'' continued Mrs. Weston, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was energetic.
<p/>Apologies for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>This was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) expressions. '
<p/>I will not say, that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'--and the quivering lip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my heart.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Poor girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thinks herself wrong, then, for having consented to a private engagement?'' <div class="bookquote">``Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is disposed to blame herself. '
<p/>The consequence,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), `has been a state of perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all the punishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct.
<p/>I have been acting contrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken, and
<p/>the kindness I am now receiving, is what my conscience tells me ought not to be.' `Do not imagine, madam,' she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) continued, `that I was taught wrong.
<p/>Pain is no expiation. I never can be blameless. Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up.
<p/>The error has been all my own; and I do assure you that, with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give, I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell.'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Poor girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma again. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) then excessively, I suppose. It must have been from attachment only, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could be led to form the engagement.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) affection must have overpowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) judgment.'' '' Yes, I have no doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) being extremely attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>). ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>returned Emma, sighing, <div class="bookquote">``that I must often have contributed to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) unhappy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``On your side, my love, it was very innocently done.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) probably had something of that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thoughts, when alluding to the misunderstandings which he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had given us hints of before.
<p/>The consciousness of having done amiss, had exposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to a thousand inquietudes, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) captious and irritable to a degree that must have been--that had been--hard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) to bear. '
<p/>I did not make the allowances,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), `which I ought to have done, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) temper and spirits--his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) delightful spirits, and that gaiety, that playfulness of disposition, which, under any other circumstances, would, I am sure, have been as constantly bewitching to me, as they were at first.'
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) then began to speak of you, and of the great kindness you had shewn her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) during her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) illness; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had an opportunity, to thank you--
<p/>One natural consequence of the evil she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had involved herself in,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``was that of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) unreasonable . I could not thank you too much--for every wish and every endeavour to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) good.
<p/>If I did not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be happy now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Emma, seriously, <div class="bookquote">``which, in spite of every little drawback from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) scrupulous conscience, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must be, I could not bear these thanks;--for, oh!
<p/>Mrs. Weston, if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss Fairfax!--Well -LRB-checking herself, and trying to be more lively-RRB-, this is all to be forgotten.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars.
<p/>They shew her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to the greatest advantage. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is very good-- I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) will be very happy.
<p/>It is fit that the fortune should be on his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) side, for I think the merit will be all on hers.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) thought well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) very much, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) defence was, therefore, earnest.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) talked with a great deal of reason, and at least equal affection--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had too much to urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) forgot to attempt to listen; and when Mrs. Weston ended with, <div class="bookquote">``We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you know, but I hope it will soon come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was obliged to pause before she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) answered, and at last obliged to answer at random, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for.
<p/>'' Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. '' Are you well, my Emma? '' was Mrs. Weston's parting question.
<p/>'' Oh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible.
<p/>Mrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food for unpleasant reflection, by increasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) esteem and compassion, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause.
<p/>Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes, in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) due; had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) tried to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) better; had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) done her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) part towards intimacy; had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must, in all probability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) now.--Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one as an associate for her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), to be received with gratitude; and the other--what was she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)?--Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax's confidence on this important matter--which was most probable--still, in knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) ought, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) might, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so unpardonably imparted; an idea which she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane's feelings, by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill's.
<p/>Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former, since her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) coming to Highbury, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was persuaded that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) must herself have been the worst.
<p/>They never could have been all three together, without her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace in a thousand instances; and on Box Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) must have been a perpetual enemy. The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield. The weather added what it could of gloom.
<p/>A cold stormy rain set in, and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the wind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such cruel sights the longer visible.
<p/>The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter's side, and by exertions which had never cost her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) half so much before.
<p/>It reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) of their first forlorn tete-a-tete, on the evening of Mrs. Weston's wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon after tea, and dissipated every melancholy fancy.
<p/>The picture which she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them, no pleasures had been lost.--But her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) present forebodings she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) feared would experience no similar contradiction.
<p/>The prospect before her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) now, was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled--that might not be even partially brightened.
<p/>If all took place that might take place among the circle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) friends, Hartfield must be comparatively deserted; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) left to cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father with the spirits only of ruined happiness.
<p/>The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied by it.
<p/>Alas! such delightful proofs of Hartfield's attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly be over. They should lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>); and, probably, in great measure, her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) husband also.--Frank
<p/>Churchill would return among them no more; and Miss Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong to Highbury.
<p/>All that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these losses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach?
<p/>Mr. Knightley to be no longer coming there for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) evening comfort!--No longer walking in at all hours, as if ever willing to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own home for their's!--How was it to be endured?
<p/>And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were to be lost to them for Harriet's sake; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were to be thought of hereafter, as finding in Harriet's society all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wanted; if Harriet were to be the chosen, the first, the dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) looked for all the best blessings of existence; what could be increasing Emma's wretchedness but
<p/>They would be married, and settled either at or near Enscombe. the reflection never far distant from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind, that it had been all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own work?
<p/>When it came to such a pitch as this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not able to refrain from a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for a few seconds--and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own better conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life to the past, it would yet find her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) more rational, more acquainted with herself, and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) less to regret when it were gone.
<p/>The weather continued much the same all the following morning; and the same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign at Hartfield--but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a softer quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it was summer again.
<p/>CHAPTER XIII With all the eagerness which such a transition gives, Emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible.
<p/>Never had the exquisite sight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after a storm, been more attractive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry's coming in soon after dinner, with a disengaged hour to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lost no time in hurrying into the shrubbery.--There, with spirits freshened, and thoughts a little relieved, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had taken a few turns, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door, and coming towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).--It was the first intimation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) being returned from London.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) the moment before, as unquestionably sixteen miles distant.--There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must be collected and calm. In half a minute they were together. The <div class="bookquote">``How d'ye do's''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>were quiet and constrained on each side.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked after their mutual friends; they were all well.--When had he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) left them?--Only that morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) must have had a wet ride.--Yes.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) meant to walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had just looked into the dining-room, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was not wanted there, preferred being out of doors.''--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) neither looked nor spoke cheerfully; and the first possible
<p/>cause for it, suggested by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fears, was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had perhaps been communicating his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) plans to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) brother, and was pained by the manner in which they had been received.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was often looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and trying for a fuller view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face than it suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to give.
<p/>Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wanted to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) attachment to Harriet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) might be watching for encouragement to begin.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did not, could not, feel equal to lead the way to any such subject.
<p/>'' They walked together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was silent. And this belief produced another dread. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) must do it all himself. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not bear this silence.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) considered--resolved--and, trying to smile, began-- <div class="bookquote">``You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather surprize you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>With him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) it was most unnatural. <div class="bookquote">``Have I? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) quietly, and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``of what nature?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! the best nature in the world--a wedding.
<p/>After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) intended to say no more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that already.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' cried Emma, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) glowing cheeks towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>); for, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) spoke, it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) might have called at Mrs. Goddard's in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) way.
<p/>I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning, and at the end of them he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) gave me a brief account of what had happened.
<p/>Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more composure, '' You probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have had your suspicions.--I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution.--I wish I had attended to it--but---LRB-with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh-RRB- I seem to have been doomed to blindness.
<p/>For a moment or two nothing was said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arm drawn within his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and pressed against his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart, and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thus saying, in a tone of great sensibility, speaking low, ``Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound.--Your own excellent sense--your exertions for your father's sake--I know you will not allow yourself--.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arm was pressed again, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) added, in a more broken and subdued accent, <div class="bookquote">``The feelings of the warmest friendship--Indignation--Abominable scoundrel!'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--And in a louder, steadier tone, he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) concluded with, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) will soon be gone.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How is it possible? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' They will soon be in Yorkshire. I am sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) .
<p/>Emma understood him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>); and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could recover from the flutter of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied, <div class="bookquote">``You are very kind--but you are mistaken--and I must set you right.--
<p/>My blindness to what was going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) deserves a better fate. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I am not in want of that sort of compassion. '' <div class="bookquote">``Emma! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), looking eagerly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``are you, indeed?'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>--but checking himself--<div class="bookquote">``No, no, I understand you--forgive me--
<p/>and it will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason.--Fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled!--I could never, I confess, from your manners, assure myself as to the degree of what you felt--I could only be certain that there was a preference--and
<p/>a preference which I never believed him (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) to deserve.--He (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) is a disgrace to the name of man.--And is he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) to be rewarded with that sweet young woman?--Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable creature.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I am pleased that you can say even so much.--He (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) is no object of regret, indeed! <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Knightley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused--<div class="bookquote">``I am in a very extraordinary situation.
<p/>I cannot let you continue in your error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression, I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse.--But I never have.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must say more before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were entitled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) opinion.
<p/>I have very little to say for my own conduct.--I was tempted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased.--An old story, probably--a common case--and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as I do for Understanding.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) listened in perfect silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to speak, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would not. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went on, however. '' Many circumstances assisted the temptation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was the son of Mr. Weston--he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was continually here--I always found him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) very pleasant--and, in short, for -LRB-with a sigh-RRB- let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this at last--my vanity was flattered, and I allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) attentions.
<p/>Latterly, however--for some time, indeed--I have had no idea of their meaning any thing.--I thought them a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) has imposed on me, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) has not injured me. I have never been attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). And now I can tolerably comprehend his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) behaviour.
<p/>It was merely a blind to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) real situation with another.--It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) object to blind all about him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>); and no one, I am sure, could be more effectually blinded than myself--except that I was not blinded--that it was my good fortune--that, in short, I was somehow or other safe from him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had hoped for an answer here--for a few words to say that her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) conduct was at least intelligible; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was silent; and, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could judge, deep in thought.
<p/>At last, and tolerably in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) usual tone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) said, ``I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill.--I can suppose, however, that I may have underrated him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>).
<p/>My acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) has been but trifling.--And even if I have not underrated him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) hitherto, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) may yet turn out well.--With such a woman he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) has a chance.--I have no motive for wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) ill--and for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sake, whose happiness will be involved in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) good character and conduct, I shall certainly wish him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) well.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no doubt of their being happy together,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma; <div class="bookquote">``I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) never wished to attach me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is a most fortunate man!'' returned Mr. Knightley, with energy.
<p/>'' So early in life--at three-and-twenty--a period when, if a man chuses a wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to have drawn such a prize!
<p/>What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation, has before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!--Assured of the love of such a woman--the disinterested love, for Jane Fairfax's character vouches for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) disinterestedness; every thing in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) favour,--equality of situation--I mean, as far as regards society, and all the habits and manners that are important; equality in every point but one--and that one, since the purity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) heart is not to be doubted, such as must increase his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) felicity, for it will be his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) to bestow the only advantages she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)
<p/>wants.--A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who can do it, where there is no doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) regard, must, I think, be the happiest of mortals.--Frank
<p/>Every thing turns out for his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) good.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) meets with a young woman at a watering-place, gains her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) affection, cannot even weary her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by negligent treatment--and had he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), they could not have found her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) superior.--His (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) aunt is in the way.--His (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) aunt dies.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) has only to speak.--His (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) friends are eager to promote his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) happiness.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had used every body ill--and they are all delighted to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>).--He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) is a fortunate man indeed!''
<p/>Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of fortune. <div class="bookquote">``You speak as if you envied him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' And I do envy him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), Emma.
<p/>They seemed to be within half a sentence of Harriet, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) immediate feeling was to avert the subject, if possible.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) plan; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would speak of something totally different--the children in Brunswick Square; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) only waited for breath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), by saying, <div class="bookquote">``You will not ask me what is the point of envy.--You are determined, I see, to have no curiosity.--You are wise--but I cannot be wise.
<p/>In one respect he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is the object of my envy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Emma could say no more. Emma, I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the next moment.''
<p/>'' Oh! then, don't speak it, don't speak it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eagerly cried. '' Take a little time, consider, do not commit yourself.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), in an accent of deep mortification, and not another syllable followed. Emma could not bear to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) pain.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might assist his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) resolution, or reconcile him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might give just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own independence, relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) from that state of indecision, which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).--They had reached the house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was wishing to confide in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)--perhaps to consult her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>);--cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) what it would, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would listen. '' You are going in, I suppose?
<p/>'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). '' No,''--replied Emma--quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) still spoke--``I should like to take another turn.
<p/>And, after proceeding a few steps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) added--<div class="bookquote">``I stopped you ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave you
<p/>pain.--But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation--as a friend, indeed, you may command me.--I will hear whatever you like.
<p/>Mr. Perry is not gone. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I will tell you exactly what I think.'' <div class="bookquote">``As a friend!'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>--repeated Mr. Knightley.--<div class="bookquote">``Emma, that I fear is a word--
<p/>Stay, yes, why should I hesitate?--I have gone too far already for concealment.--Emma, I accept your offer--Extraordinary as it may seem,
<p/>No, I have no wish-- I accept it, and refer myself to you as a friend.--Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?
<p/>My dearest Emma,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``for dearest you will always be, whatever the event of this hour's conversation, my dearest, most beloved Emma--tell me at once.
<p/>Say `No,' if it is to be said.'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could really say nothing.--<div class="bookquote">``You are silent,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) cried, with great animation; <div class="bookquote">``absolutely silent!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stopped in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) earnestness to look the question, and the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes overpowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). '' at present I ask no more.
<p/>'' Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most prominent feeling.
<p/>I cannot make speeches, Emma:'' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) soon resumed; and in a tone of such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing.--<div class="bookquote">``If
<p/>But you know what I am.--You hear nothing but truth from me.--I have blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it.--Bear with the truths I would tell you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. The manner, perhaps, may have as little to recommend them.
<p/>God knows, I have been a very indifferent lover.--But you understand me.--Yes, you see, you understand my feelings--and will return them if you can.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful velocity of thought, had been able--and yet without losing a word--to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that Harriet's hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as complete a delusion as any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own--that Harriet was nothing; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was every thing herself; that what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own feelings; and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) agitation, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) doubts, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) reluctance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) discouragement, had been all received as discouragement from herself.--And not only was there time for these convictions, with all their glow of attendant happiness; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet's secret had not escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), and to resolve that it need not, and should not.--It was all the service she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could now render her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) poor friend; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to transfer his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) affection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the two--or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) at once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could not marry them both, Emma had it not.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt for Harriet, with pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad, opposing all that could be probable or reasonable, entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) brain.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend astray, and it would be a reproach to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) for ever; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) judgment was as strong as her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) feelings, and as strong as it had ever been before, in reprobating any such alliance for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), as most unequal and degrading.
<p/>At present, I ask only to hear, once to hear your voice. '' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) way was clear, though not quite smooth.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) spoke then, on being so entreated.--What
<p/>did she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) say?--Just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ought, of course. A lady always does.--She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said enough to shew there need not be despair--and to invite him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to say more himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had despaired at one period; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had received such an injunction to caution and silence, as for the time crushed every hope;--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had begun by refusing to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).--The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden;--her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) proposal of taking another turn, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) renewing the conversation which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had just put an end to, might be a little extraordinary!--She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) felt its inconsistency; but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it, and seek no farther explanation.
<p/>Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material.--Mr.
<p/>Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own influence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had come, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) anxiety to see how she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bore Frank Churchill's engagement, with no selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring,
<p/>if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) an opening, to soothe or to counsel her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).--The rest had been the work of the moment, the immediate effect of what he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) heard, on his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) feelings.
<p/>The delightful assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) total indifference towards Frank Churchill, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) having a heart completely disengaged from him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), had given birth to the hope, that, in time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) might gain her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) affection himself;--but
<p/>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had only, in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment, aspired to be told that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not forbid his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) attempt to attach her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).--The superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting.--The affection, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been asking to be allowed to create, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could, was already his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)!--Within half an hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind, to something so like perfect happiness, that it could bear no other name.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) change was equal.--This one half-hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust.--On his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) side, there had been a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation, of Frank Churchill.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been in love with Emma, and jealous of Frank Churchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probably enlightened him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) as to the other.
<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) from the country.--The Box Hill party had decided him (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) on going away.
<p/>it had been no present hope He (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) would save himself from witnessing again such permitted, encouraged attentions.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) had gone to learn to be indifferent.--But
<p/>There was too much domestic happiness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) brother's house; woman wore too amiable a form in it; Isabella was too much like Emma--differing only in those striking inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy before him (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>), for much to have been done, even had his (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) time been longer.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) had stayed on, however, vigorously, day after day--till this very morning's post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax.--Then, with the gladness which must be felt, nay, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) did not scruple to feel, having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma, was there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could stay no longer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had ridden home through the rain; and had walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) faults, bore the discovery.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had gone to a wrong place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) agitated and low.--Frank Churchill was a villain.-- He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) declare that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had never loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>).
<p/>Frank Churchill's character was not desperate.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own Emma, by hand and word, when they returned into the house; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could have thought of Frank Churchill then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) might have deemed him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) a very good sort of fellow.
<p/>CHAPTER XIV What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had brought out!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
<p/>was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness, and such happiness moreover as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away.
<p/>They sat down to tea--the same party round the same table--how often it had been collected!--and how often had her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun!--But never in such a state of spirits, never in any thing like it; and it was with difficulty that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could summon enough of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) usual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or even the attentive daughter.
<p/>Poor Mr. Woodhouse little suspected what was plotting against him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) in the breast of that man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was so cordially welcoming, and so anxiously hoping might not have taken cold from his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) ride.--Could
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) have seen the heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would have cared very little for the lungs; but without the most distant imagination of the impending evil, without the slightest perception of any thing extraordinary in the looks or ways of either, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) repeated to them very comfortably all the articles of news he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had received from Mr. Perry, and talked on with much self-contentment, totally unsuspicious of what they could have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) in return.
<p/>As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began to be a little tranquillised and subdued--and in the course of the sleepless night, which was the tax for such an evening
<p/>, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found one or two such very serious points to consider, as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feel, that even her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) happiness must have some alloy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not be alone without feeling the full weight of their separate claims; and how to guard the comfort of both to the utmost, was the question.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hardly knew yet what Mr. Knightley would ask; but a very short parley with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own heart produced the most solemn resolution of never quitting her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) even wept over the idea of it, as a sin of thought.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lived, it must be only an engagement; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) flattered herself, that if divested of the danger of drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) away, it might become an increase of comfort to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).--How to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) best by Harriet, was of more difficult decision;--how to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) from any unnecessary pain; how to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) any possible atonement; how to appear least her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) enemy?--On these subjects, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) perplexity and distress were very great--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind had to pass again and again through every bitter reproach and sorrowful regret that had ever surrounded it.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could only resolve at last, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would still avoid a meeting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and communicate all that need be told by letter; that it would be inexpressibly desirable to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) removed just now for a time from Highbury, and--indulging in one scheme more--nearly resolve, that it might be practicable to get an invitation for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to Brunswick Square.--Isabella had been pleased with Harriet; and a few weeks spent in London must give her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) some amusement.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did not think it in Harriet's nature to escape being benefited by novelty and variety, by the streets, the shops, and the children.--At any rate, it would be a proof of attention and kindness in herself, from whom every thing was due; a separation for the present; an averting of the evil day, when they must all be together again.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) rose early, and wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) letter to Harriet; an employment which left her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) so very serious, so nearly sad, that Mr. Knightley, in walking up to Hartfield to breakfast, did not arrive at all too soon; and half an hour stolen afterwards to go over the same ground again with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), literally and figuratively, was quite necessary to reinstate her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) in a proper share of the happiness of the evening before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had not left her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) long, by no means long enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) to have the slightest inclination for thinking of any body else, when a letter was brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) from Randalls--a very thick letter;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) guessed what it must contain, and deprecated the necessity of reading it.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) was now in perfect charity with Frank Churchill; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) wanted no explanations, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) wanted only to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) thoughts to herself--and as for understanding any thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) wrote, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) was incapable of it.--It must be waded through, however.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) opened the packet; it was too surely so;--a note from Mrs. Weston to herself, ushered in the letter from Frank to Mrs. Weston.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) father--and Harriet. With respect to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father, it was a question soon answered. '' I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding to you the enclosed.
<p/>think we shall never materially disagree about the writer again; but I will not delay you by a long preface.--We are
<p/>quite well.--This letter has been the cure of all the little nervousness I have been feeling lately.--I did not quite like your looks on Tuesday, but it was an ungenial morning; and
<p/>though you will never own being affected by weather, I think every body feels a north-east wind.--I felt for your dear father very much in the storm of Tuesday afternoon and yesterday morning, but had the comfort of hearing last night, by Mr. Perry, that it had not made him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) ill.
<p/>I know what thorough justice you will do it, and have scarcely a doubt of its happy effect.--I '' Yours ever, ``A. W.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If I made myself intelligible yesterday, this letter will be expected; but expected or not, I know it will be read with candour
<p/>and indulgence.--You are all goodness, and I believe there will be need of even all your goodness to allow for some parts of my past
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LSB-To Mrs. Weston.-RSB- WINDSOR-JULY. MY DEAR MADAM, conduct.--But I have been forgiven by one who had still more to resent.
<p/>I have already met with such success in two applications for pardon, that I may be in danger of thinking myself too sure of yours, and of those among your friends who have had any ground of offence.--You must all endeavour to comprehend the exact nature of my situation when I first arrived at Randalls; you must consider me as having a secret which was to be kept at all hazards.
<p/>My courage rises while I write. It is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble. This was the fact. My right to place myself in a situation requiring such concealment, is another question.
<p/>For my temptation to think it a right, I refer every caviller to a brick house, sashed windows below, and casements above, in Highbury.
<p/>I dared not address her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) openly; my difficulties in the then state of Enscombe must be too well known to require definition; and I was fortunate enough to prevail, before we parted at Weymouth, and to induce the most upright female mind in the creation to stoop in charity to a secret engagement.--Had she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) refused, I should have gone mad.--But you will be ready to say, what was your hope in doing this?--What
<p/>did you look forward to?--To any thing, every thing--to time, chance, circumstance, slow effects, sudden bursts, perseverance and weariness, health and sickness.
<p/>Every possibility of good was before me, and the first of blessings secured, in obtaining her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) promises of faith and correspondence.
<p/>If you need farther explanation, I have the honour, my dear madam, of being your husband's son, and the advantage of inheriting a disposition to hope for good, which no inheritance of houses or lands can ever equal the value of.--See me, then, under these circumstances, arriving on my first visit to Randalls;--and here I am conscious of wrong, for that visit might have been sooner paid.
<p/>You will look back and see that I did not come till Miss Fairfax was in Highbury; and as you were the person slighted, you will forgive me instantly; but I must work on my father's compassion, by reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), that so long as I absented myself from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) house, so long I lost the blessing of knowing you.
<p/>My behaviour, during the very happy fortnight which I spent with you, did not, I hope, lay me open to reprehension, excepting on one point.
<p/>And now I come to the principal, the only important part of my conduct while belonging to you, which excites my own anxiety, or requires very solicitous explanation.
<p/>With the greatest respect, and the warmest friendship, do I mention Miss Woodhouse; my father perhaps will think I ought to add, with the deepest humiliation.--A
<p/>few words which dropped from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) yesterday spoke his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) opinion, and some censure I acknowledge myself liable to.--My behaviour to Miss Woodhouse indicated, I believe, more than it ought.--In order to assist a concealment so essential to me, I was led on to make more than an allowable use of the sort of intimacy into which we were immediately thrown.--I cannot deny that Miss Woodhouse was my ostensible object--but I am sure you will believe the declaration, that had I not been convinced of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) indifference, I would not have been induced by any selfish views to go on.--Amiable and delightful as Miss Woodhouse is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) never gave me the idea of a young woman likely to be attached; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was perfectly free from any tendency to being attached to me, was as much my conviction as my wish.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) received my attentions with an easy, friendly, goodhumoured playfulness, which exactly suited me.
<p/>I shall not discuss it here. We seemed to understand each other. From our relative situation, those attentions were her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) due, and were felt to be so.--Whether
<p/>Miss Woodhouse began really to understand me before the expiration of that fortnight, I cannot say;--when I called to take leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), I remember that I was within a moment of confessing the truth, and I then fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was not without suspicion; but I have no doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) having since detected me, at least in some degree.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) may not have surmised the whole, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) quickness must have penetrated a part.
<p/>You will find, whenever the subject becomes freed from its present restraints, that it did not take her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) wholly by surprize.
<p/>I cannot doubt it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) frequently gave me hints of it. I remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) telling me at the ball, that I owed Mrs. Elton gratitude for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) attentions to Miss
<p/>Fairfax.--I hope this history of my conduct towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) will be admitted by you and my father as great extenuation of what you saw amiss.
<p/>Acquit me here, and procure for me, when it is allowable, the acquittal and good wishes of that said Emma Woodhouse, whom I regard with so much brotherly affection, as to long to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) as deeply and as happily in love as myself.--Whatever strange things I said or did during that fortnight, you have now a key to.
<p/>My heart was in Highbury, and my business was to get my body thither as often as might be, and with the least suspicion.
<p/>While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either. If you remember any queernesses, set them all to the right
<p/>account.--Of the pianoforte so much talked of, I feel it only necessary to say, that its being ordered was absolutely unknown to Miss F--, who would never have allowed me to send it, had any choice been given her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>).--The delicacy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) mind throughout the whole engagement, my dear madam, is much beyond my power of doing justice to.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) must tell you herself what she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is--yet not by word, for never was there a human creature who would so designedly suppress her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own
<p/>I began this letter, which will be longer than I foresaw, I have heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>).--She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) gives a good account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own health; but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) never complains, I dare not depend.
<p/>You will soon, I earnestly hope, know her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) thoroughly yourself.--No description can describe her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>). merit.--Since I want to have your opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) looks.
<p/>I know you will soon call on her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is living in dread of the visit. Perhaps it is paid already.
<p/>Remember how few minutes I was at Randalls, and in how bewildered, how mad a state: and I am not much better yet; still insane either from happiness or misery.
<p/>When I think of the kindness and favour I have met with, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) excellence and patience, and my uncle's generosity, I am mad with joy: but when I recollect all the uneasiness I occasioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), and how little I deserve to be forgiven, I am mad with anger.
<p/>Let me hear from you without delay; I am impatient for a thousand particulars. If I could but see her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) again!--But
<p/>I must not propose it yet. My uncle has been too good for me to encroach.--I must still add to this long letter.
<p/>I could not give any connected detail yesterday; but the suddenness, and, in one light, the unseasonableness with which the affair burst out, needs explanation; for though the event of the 26th ult., as you will conclude, immediately opened to me the happiest prospects, I should not have presumed on such early measures, but from the very particular circumstances, which left me not an hour to lose.
<p/>I should myself have shrunk from any thing so hasty, and she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) would have felt every scruple of mine with multiplied strength
<p/>The hasty engagement she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had entered into with that woman--Here, my dear madam, I was obliged to leave off abruptly, to recollect and compose myself.--I have been walking over the country, and am now, I hope, rational enough to make the rest of my letter what it ought to be.--It is, in fact, a most mortifying retrospect for me.
<p/>You have not heard all that you ought to hear. and refinement.--But I had no choice. I behaved shamefully. And here I can admit, that my manners to Miss W., in being unpleasant to Miss F., were highly blameable.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did not think sufficient.--She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was displeased; I thought unreasonably so: I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), on a thousand occasions, unnecessarily scrupulous and cautious: I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) even cold.
<p/>If I had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) judgment, and subdued my spirits to the level of what she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) deemed proper, I should have escaped the greatest unhappiness I have ever known.--We quarrelled.--
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) disapproved them, which ought to have been enough.--My plea of concealing the truth But she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was always right. Do you remember the morning spent at Donwell?--
<p/>I was late; I met her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) walking home by herself, and wanted to walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would not suffer it.
<p/>There every little dissatisfaction that had occurred before came to a crisis. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) absolutely refused to allow me, which I then thought most unreasonable.
<p/>While I, to blind the world to our engagement, was behaving one hour with objectionable particularity to another woman, was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to be consenting the next to a proposal which might have made every previous caution useless?--Had
<p/>Now, however, I see nothing in it but a very natural and consistent degree of discretion. we been met walking together between Donwell and Highbury, the truth must have been
<p/>I doubted it more the next day on Box Hill; when, provoked by such conduct on my side, such shameful, insolent neglect of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and such apparent devotion to Miss W., as it would have been impossible for any woman of sense to endure, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) resentment in a form of words perfectly intelligible to me.--In short, my dear madam, it was a quarrel blameless on her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) side, abominable on mine; and I returned the same evening to Richmond, though I might have staid with you till the next morning, merely because I would be as angry with her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) as possible.
<p/>Even then, I was not such a fool as not to mean to be reconciled in time; but I was the injured person, injured by her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) coldness, and I went away determined that she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) should make the first advances.--I shall always congratulate myself that you were not of the Box Hill party.
<p/>suspected.--I was mad enough, however, to resent.--I doubted her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) affection. Had you witnessed my behaviour there, I can hardly suppose you would ever have thought well of me again.
<p/>Its effect upon her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) appears in the immediate resolution it produced: as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) found I was really gone from Randalls, she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) closed with the offer of that officious Mrs. Elton; the whole system of whose treatment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), by the bye, has ever filled me with indignation and hatred.
<p/>but, otherwise, I should loudly protest against the share of it which that woman has known.--`Jane,' indeed!--You will observe that I have not yet indulged myself in calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) by that name, even to you.
<p/>Think, then, what I must have endured in hearing it bandied between the Eltons with all the vulgarity of needless repetition, and all the insolence of imaginary superiority.
<p/>Have patience with me, I shall soon have done.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) closed with this offer, resolving to break with me entirely, and wrote the next day to tell me that we never were to meet again.--
<p/>I must not quarrel with a spirit of forbearance which has been so richly extended towards myself; She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each : she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) dissolved it .--This
<p/>I answered it within an hour; but from the confusion of my mind, and the multiplicity of business falling on me at once, my answer, instead of being sent with all the many other letters of that day, was locked up in my writing-desk; and I, trusting that I had written enough, though but a few lines, to satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), remained without any uneasiness.--I was rather disappointed that I did not hear from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) again speedily; but I made excuses for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), and was too busy, and--may I add?--too cheerful in my views to be captious.--We
<p/>removed to Windsor; and two days afterwards I received a parcel from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), my own letters all returned!--and a few lines at the same time by the post, stating her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) extreme surprize at not having had the smallest reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) last; and adding, that as silence on such a point could not be misconstrued, and as it must be equally desirable to both to have every subordinate arrangement concluded as soon as possible, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) now sent me, by a safe conveyance, all my letters, and requested, that if I could not directly command hers, so as to send them to Highbury within a week, I would forward them after that period to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) at--: in short, the full direction to Mr. Smallridge's, near Bristol, stared me in the face.
<p/>letter reached me on the very morning of my poor aunt's death. I knew the name, the place, I knew all about it, and instantly saw what she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had been doing.
<p/>It was perfectly accordant with that resolution of character which I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to possess; and the secrecy she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had maintained, as to any such design in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) former letter, was equally descriptive of its anxious delicacy.
<p/>For the world would not she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) have seemed to threaten me.--Imagine the shock; imagine how, till I had actually detected my own blunder, I raved at the blunders of the post.--What was to be done?--One thing only.--I
<p/>Without his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) sanction I could not hope to be listened to again.--I spoke; circumstances were in my favour; the late event had softened away his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) pride, and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was, earlier than I could have anticipated, wholly reconciled and complying; and could say at last, poor man!
<p/>must speak to my uncle. with a deep sigh, that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) wished I might find as much happiness in the marriage state
<p/>as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had done.--I felt that it would be of a different sort.--Are you disposed to pity me for what I must have suffered in opening the cause to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), for my suspense while all was at stake?--No; do not pity me till I reached Highbury, and saw how ill I had made her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
<p/>Do not pity me till I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wan, sick looks.--I reached Highbury at the time of day when, from my knowledge of their late breakfast hour, I was certain of a good chance of finding her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) alone.--I was not disappointed; and at last I was not disappointed either in the object of my journey.
<p/>But it is done; we are reconciled, dearer, much dearer, than ever, and no moment's uneasiness can ever occur between us again.
<p/>A great deal of very reasonable, very just displeasure I had to persuade away. Now, my dear madam, I will release you; but I could not conclude before.
<p/>A thousand and a thousand thanks for all the kindness you have ever shewn me, and ten thousand for the attentions your heart will dictate towards her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>).--If
<p/>you think me in a way to be happier than I deserve, I am quite of your opinion.--Miss W. calls me the child of good fortune.
<p/>I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) is right.--In one respect, my good fortune is undoubted, that of being able to subscribe myself, Your obliged and affectionate Son, F. C. WESTON CHURCHILL.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) was obliged, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) previous determination to the contrary, to do it all the justice that Mrs. Weston foretold.
<p/>As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own name, it was irresistible; every line relating to herself was interesting, and almost every line agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the subject could still maintain itself, by the natural return of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) former regard for the writer, and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) at that moment.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) never stopt till she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had gone through the whole; and though it was impossible not to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) had been wrong, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) had been less wrong than she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had supposed--and he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) had suffered, and was very sorry--and he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) was so grateful to Mrs. Weston, and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was so happy herself, that there was no being severe; and could he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) have entered the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must have shaken hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) as heartily as ever.
<p/>CHAPTER XV This letter must make its way to Emma's feelings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) desired him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to read it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was sure of Mrs. Weston's wishing it to be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley, had seen so much to blame in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) conduct.
<p/>'' I shall be very glad to look it over,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but it seems long. I will take it home with me at night.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But that would not do. Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must return it by him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).
<p/>'' I would rather be talking to you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) replied; ``but as it seems a matter of justice, it shall be done.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) began--stopping, however, almost directly to say, <div class="bookquote">``Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mother-in-law a few months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with a smile, observed, <div class="bookquote">``Humph! a fine complimentary opening:
<p/>But it is his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) way. One man's style must not be the rule of another's. We will not be severe.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It will be natural for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) added shortly afterwards, <div class="bookquote">``to speak my opinion aloud as I read.
<p/>By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you. It will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at all.
<p/>I should wish it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Knightley returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) reading with greater alacrity. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) trifles here,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``as to the temptation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) knows he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is wrong, and has nothing rational to urge.--Bad.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) ought not to have formed the engagement.--`His (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) father's disposition:'--he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is unjust, however, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) father.
<p/>Mr. Weston's sanguine temper was a blessing on all his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) upright and honourable exertions; but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) endeavoured to gain it.--Very true; he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not come till Miss Fairfax was here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And I have not forgotten,'' said Emma, <div class="bookquote">``how sure you were that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might have come sooner if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would.
<p/>You pass it over very handsomely--but you were perfectly right.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>``I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:--but yet, I think--had you not been in the case--I should still have distrusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) came to Miss Woodhouse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was obliged to read the whole of it aloud--all that related to her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), with a smile; a look; a shake of the head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, as the subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steady reflection, thus-- <div class="bookquote">``Very bad--though it might have been worse.--Playing a most dangerous game.
<p/>Too much indebted to the event for his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) acquittal.--No judge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own manners by you.--Always deceived in fact by his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own wishes, and regardless of little besides his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own convenience.--Fancying you to have fathomed his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) secret.
<p/>My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other?''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's account, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not give any sincere explanation of.
<p/>'' Natural enough!--his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own mind full of intrigue, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should suspect it in others.--Mystery; Finesse--how they pervert the understanding! ''
<p/>That was the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure.
<p/>A boyish scheme, indeed!--I cannot comprehend a man's wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would rather dispense with; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did know that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have prevented the instrument's coming if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could.''
<p/>You had better go on,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did so, but very soon stopt again to say, <div class="bookquote">``the pianoforte! Ah! After this, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made some progress without any pause.
<p/>Frank Churchill's confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>I perfectly agree with you, sir,''--was then his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) remark. '' You did behave very shamefully. You never wrote a truer line.
<p/>And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax's sense of right, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) made a fuller pause to say, <div class="bookquote">``This is very bad.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) to place herself, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness, and it should have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) first object to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) from suffering unnecessarily.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) must have had much more to contend with, in carrying on the correspondence, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could.
<p/>We must look to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) one fault, and remember that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement, to bear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) should have been in such a state of punishment.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) should have respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers were all reasonable. '' Emma knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew uncomfortable.
<p/>It was all read, however, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and, excepting one momentary glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), instantly withdrawn, in the fear of giving pain--no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own behaviour had been so very improper! She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) next look. ''
<p/>There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, the Eltons,'' was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) next observation.--<div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) feelings are natural.--What!
<p/>entirely!--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dissolved it.--What a view this gives of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) behaviour!--Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) must be a most extraordinary--''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>actually resolve to break with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, read on.--You will find how very much he (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) suffers. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) does,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the letter.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge's children--a dear friend of Mrs. Elton's--a neighbour of Maple Grove; and, by the bye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?''
<p/>'' ' Smallridge!'--What does this mean? What is all this?'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read--not even of Mrs. Elton.
<p/>Only one page more. I shall soon have done. What a letter the man writes!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, there is feeling here.--He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does seem to have suffered in finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) ill.--Certainly, I can have no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). '
<p/>I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation.--He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a very liberal thanker, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thousands and tens of thousands.--`Happier than I deserve.'
<p/>'' Dearer, much dearer than ever.' Come, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows himself there. ' Miss Woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune.'--Those were Miss Woodhouse's words, were they?--
<p/>And a fine ending--and there is the letter. The child of good fortune! That was your name for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), was it?''
<p/>You do not appear so well satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) letter as I am; but still you must, at least I hope you must, think the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has had great faults, faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opinion in thinking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likely to be happier than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deserves: but still as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it may be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), I am very ready to believe his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character will improve, and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants.
<p/>'' I hope it does him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) some service with you. '' '' Yes, certainly it does. And now, let me talk to you of something else.
<p/>I have another person's interest at present so much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill. Ever since I left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work on one subject.
<p/>The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike English, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was in love with, how to be able to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), without attacking the happiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father.
<p/>'' Emma's answer was ready at the first word. '' While her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/>The impossibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quitting her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility of any other change, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not agree to.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had been thinking it over most deeply, most intently; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to Donwell; he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had wanted to believe it feasible, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to deceive himself long; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) confessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) persuasion, that such a transplantation would be a risk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's comfort, perhaps even of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life, which must not be hazarded.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could never quit him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). '' Part only of this answer, however, was admitted. Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!--No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) felt that it ought not to be attempted.
<p/>But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) trusted his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable; it was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) should be received at Hartfield; that so long as her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's happiness--in other words, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life--required Hartfield to continue her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) home, it should be his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) likewise.
<p/>Like him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had tried the scheme and rejected it; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>).
<p/>Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own passing thoughts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was sensible of all the affection it evinced.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt that, in quitting Donwell, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits; that in living constantly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, and in no house of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own, there would be much, very much, to be borne with.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) promised to think of it, and advised him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to think of it more; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was fully convinced, that no reflection could alter his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wishes or his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) opinion on the subject.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had given it, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), very long and calm consideration; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning, to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) thoughts to himself.
<p/>'' Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for,'' cried Emma. '' I am sure William Larkins will not like it. You must get his (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) consent before you ask mine.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised, moreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good scheme.
<p/>It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never struck with any sense of injury to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nephew Henry, whose rights as heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded.
<p/>Think she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must of the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.
<p/>This proposal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield--the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) contemplated it, the more pleasing it became.
<p/>Such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)!--Such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield.
<p/>The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, in mere charitable caution, be kept at a distance from.
<p/>'' His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) evils seemed to lessen, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own advantages to increase, their mutual good to outweigh every drawback. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would be a loser in every way.
<p/>In such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in such a state of unmerited punishment.
<p/>In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is, supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early.
<p/>Emma could not deplore her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) future absence as any deduction from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own enjoyment. Mr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;--not like Mr. Elton.
<p/>Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so truly considerate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshipped than now; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could be in love with more than three men in one year.
<p/>CHAPTER XVI It was a very great relief to Emma to find Harriet as desirous as herself to avoid a meeting.
<p/>Harriet expressed herself very much as might be supposed, without reproaches, or apparent sense of ill-usage; and yet Emma fancied there was a something of resentment, a something bordering on it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) style, which increased the desirableness of their being separate.--It might be only her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own consciousness; but it seemed as if an angel only could have been quite without resentment under such a stroke.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had no difficulty in procuring Isabella's invitation; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was fortunate in having a sufficient reason for asking it, without resorting to invention.--There
<p/>Their intercourse was painful enough by letter. How much worse, had they been obliged to meet! was a tooth amiss. Harriet really wished, and had wished some time, to consult a dentist.
<p/>Mrs. John Knightley was delighted to be of use; any thing of ill health was a recommendation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)--and though not so fond of a dentist as of a Mr. Wingfield, she (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was quite eager to have Harriet under her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) care.--When it was thus settled on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) sister's side, Emma proposed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend, and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) very persuadable.--Harriet was to go; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was invited for at least a fortnight; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was to be conveyed in Mr. Woodhouse's carriage.--It was all arranged, it was all completed, and Harriet was safe in Brunswick Square.
<p/>Now Emma could, indeed, enjoy Mr. Knightley's visits; now she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could talk, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could listen with true happiness, unchecked by that sense of injustice, of guilt, of something most painful, which had haunted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) when remembering how disappointed a heart was near her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>),
<p/>how much might at that moment, and at a little distance, be enduring by the feelings which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had led astray herself.
<p/>The difference of Harriet at Mrs. Goddard's, or in London, made perhaps an unreasonable difference in Emma's sensations; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in London without objects of curiosity and employment, which must be averting the past, and carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) out of herself.
<p/>There was a communication before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), one which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) only could be competent to make--the confession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) engagement to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have nothing to do with it at present.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had resolved to defer the disclosure till Mrs. Weston were safe and well.
<p/>No additional agitation should be thrown at this period among those she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) loved--and the evil should not act on herself by anticipation before the appointed time.--A fortnight, at least, of leisure and peace of mind, to crown every warmer, but more agitating, delight, should be hers.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) soon resolved, equally as a duty and a pleasure, to employ half an hour of this holiday of spirits in calling on Miss Fairfax.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) ought to go--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was longing to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>); the resemblance of their present situations increasing every other motive of goodwill.
<p/>It would be a secret satisfaction; but the consciousness of a similarity of prospect would certainly add to the interest with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should attend to any thing Jane might communicate.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) went--she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had driven once unsuccessfully to the door, but had not been into the house since the morning after Box Hill, when poor Jane had been in such distress as had filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) with compassion, though all the worst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sufferings had been unsuspected.--The fear of being still unwelcome, determined her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>),
<p/>though assured of their being at home, to wait in the passage, and send up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) name.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) heard Patty announcing it; but no such bustle succeeded as poor Miss Bates had before made so happily intelligible.--No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) heard nothing but the instant reply of, <div class="bookquote">``Beg her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) to walk up;'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and a moment afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was met on the stairs by Jane herself, coming eagerly forward, as if no other reception of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) were felt sufficient.--Emma had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) look so well, so lovely, so engaging.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would not allow any other anxiety to succeed directly to the place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind which Harriet had occupied. There was consciousness, animation, and warmth; there was every thing which her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) countenance or manner could ever have
<p/>wanted.-- She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) came forward with an offered hand; and said, in a low, but very feeling tone, ``This is most kind, indeed!--Miss Woodhouse, it is impossible for me to express--I hope you will believe--Excuse me for being so entirely without words.
<p/>Emma was gratified, and would soon have shewn no want of words, if the sound of Mrs. Elton's voice from the sitting-room had not checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), and made it expedient to compress all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) friendly and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) congratulatory sensations into a very, very earnest shake of the hand.
<p/>Emma could have wished Mrs. Elton elsewhere; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was in a humour to have patience with every body; and as Mrs. Elton met her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) with unusual graciousness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) hoped the rencontre would do them no harm.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) soon believed herself to penetrate Mrs. Elton's thoughts, and understand why she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was, like herself, in happy spirits; it was being in Miss Fairfax's confidence, and fancying herself acquainted with what was still a secret to other people.
<p/>Emma saw symptoms of it immediately in the expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face; and while paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own compliments to Mrs. Bates, and appearing to attend to the good old lady's replies, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with a sort of anxious parade of mystery fold up a letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had apparently been reading aloud to Miss Fairfax, and return it into the purple and gold reticule by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) side, saying, with significant nods, <div class="bookquote">``We can finish this some other time, you know.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Bates and Mrs. Elton were together. Miss Bates was out, which accounted for the previous tranquillity. You and I shall not want opportunities.
<p/>And, in fact, you have heard all the essential already. I only wanted to prove to you that Mrs. S. admits our apology, and is not offended.
<p/>You see how delightfully she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) writes. Oh! she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is a sweet creature! You would have doated on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), had you gone.--But not a word more.
<p/>Let us be discreet--quite on our good behaviour.--Hush!--You remember those lines--I forget the poem at this moment: ``For when a lady's in the case, <div class="bookquote">``You know all other things give place.
<p/>Now I say, my dear, in our case, for lady , read--mum! a word to the wise.--I am in a fine flow of spirits,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div>an't I? But I want to set your heart at ease as to Mrs. S.-- My representation, you see, has quite appeased her (<font color='blue'><b>mum</b></font>).
<p/>And again, on Emma's merely turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head to look at Mrs. Bates's knitting, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) added, in a half whisper, <div class="bookquote">``I mentioned no names , you will observe.--Oh!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>no; cautious as a minister of state. I managed it extremely well. '' Emma could not doubt. It was a palpable display, repeated on every possible occasion.
<p/>When they had all talked a little while in harmony of the weather and Mrs. Weston, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) found herself abruptly addressed with,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not you think, Miss Woodhouse, our saucy little friend here is charmingly recovered?--Do not you think her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) cure does Perry the highest credit?---LRB-here was a side-glance of great meaning at Jane.-RRB-
<p/>Upon my word, Perry has restored her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) in a wonderful short time!--Oh! if you had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), as I did, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was at the worst!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--And when Mrs. Bates was saying something to Emma, whispered farther, <div class="bookquote">``We do not say a word of any assistance that Perry might have; not a word of a certain young physician from Windsor.--Oh!
<p/>no ; Perry shall have all the credit. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' I have scarce had the pleasure of seeing you, Miss Woodhouse,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) shortly afterwards began, <div class="bookquote">``since the party to Box Hill.
<p/>Things did not seem--that is, there seemed a little cloud upon the spirits of some.--So it appeared to me at least, but I might be mistaken.
<p/>Very pleasant party. But yet I think there was something wanting. However, I think it answered so far as to tempt one to go again.
<p/>What say you both to our collecting the same party, and exploring to Box Hill again, while the fine weather lasts?--It must be the same party, you know, quite the same party, not one exception.
<p/>Soon after this Miss Bates came in, and Emma could not help being diverted by the perplexity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) first answer to herself, resulting, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) supposed, from doubt of what might be said, and impatience to say every thing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Thank you, dear Miss Woodhouse, you are all kindness.--It is impossible to say-- Yes, indeed, I quite understand-- dearest Jane's prospects--
<p/>is Mr. Woodhouse?--I am so glad.--Quite out of my power.--Such a happy little circle as you find us here.--Yes, indeed.--Charming young man!--that is--so very friendly
<p/>; I mean good Mr. Perry!--such attention to Jane!''--And from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) great, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) more than commonly thankful delight towards Mrs. Elton for being there, Emma guessed that there had been a little show of resentment towards Jane, from the vicarage quarter, which was now graciously overcome.--After a few whispers, indeed, which placed it beyond a guess, Mrs. Elton, speaking louder, said, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, here I am, my good friend; and here I have been so long, that anywhere else I should think it necessary to apologise; but, the truth is, that I am waiting for my lord and master.
<p/>that is, I do not mean.--But she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is charmingly recovered.--How He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) promised to join me here, and pay his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) respects to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What! are we to have the pleasure of a call from Mr. Elton?--That will be a favour indeed! for I know gentlemen do not like morning visits, and Mr. Elton's time is so engaged.''

<p/>my word, Mr. E.,' I often say, `rather you than I.--I do not know what would become of my crayons and my instrument
<p/>, if I had half so many applicants.'--Bad enough as it is, for I absolutely neglect them both to an unpardonable degree.--I believe I have not played a bar this fortnight.--However
<p/>They seem not able to do any thing without him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).--`Upon , he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is coming, I assure you: yes, indeed, on purpose to wait on you all.

''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>Miss Bates looked about her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), so happily--! ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) promised to come to me as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) could disengage himself from Knightley; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) and Knightley are shut up together in deep consultation.--Mr.
<p/>Emma would not have smiled for the world, and only said, <div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Elton gone on foot to Donwell?--He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) will have a hot walk.
<p/>Weston and Cole will be there too; but one is apt to speak only of those who lead.--I fancy Mr. E. and Knightley have every thing their own way.
<p/>E. is Knightley's right hand. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Emma</b></font>)</div>'' '' Oh! no, it is a meeting at the Crown, a regular meeting. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have not you mistaken the day?''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma. '' I am almost certain that the meeting at the Crown is not till to-morrow.--Mr.
<p/>no, the meeting is certainly to-day,'' was the abrupt answer, which denoted the impossibility of any blunder on Mrs. Elton's side.--<div class="bookquote">``I do believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``this is the most troublesome parish that ever was.
<p/>Knightley was at Hartfield yesterday, and spoke of it as for Saturday.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! We never heard of such things at Maple Grove.
<p/>'' '' Your parish there was small,'' said Jane. '' Upon my word, my dear, I do not know, for I never heard the subject talked of.''
<p/>But it is proved by the smallness of the school, which I have heard you speak of, as under the patronage of your sister and Mrs. Bragge; the only school, and not more than five-and-twenty children.''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! you clever creature, that's very true. What a thinking brain you have! I say, Jane, what a perfect character you
<p/>My liveliness and your solidity would produce perfection.--Not that I presume to insinuate, however, that some people may not think you perfection already.--But hush!--not a word, if you please.
<p/>It seemed an unnecessary caution; Jane was wanting to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) words, not to Mrs. Elton, but to Miss Woodhouse, as the latter plainly saw.
<p/>The wish of distinguishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), as far as civility permitted, was very evident, though it could not often proceed beyond a look.
<p/>and I should make, if we could be shaken together. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>Mr. Elton made his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) appearance. His (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) lady greeted him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) with some of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sparkling vivacity.
<p/>Very pretty, sir, upon my word; to send me on here, to be an encumbrance to my friends, so long before you vouchsafe to come!--But you knew what a dutiful creature you had to deal with.
<p/>You knew I should not stir till my lord and master appeared.--Here have I been sitting this hour, giving these young ladies a sample of true conjugal obedience--for who can say, you know, how soon it may be wanted?
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) civilities to the other ladies must be paid; but his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) subsequent object was to lament over himself for the heat he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was suffering, and the walk he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) had had for nothing.
<p/>'' '' Mr. Elton was so hot and tired, that all this wit seemed thrown away. '' When I got to Donwell,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Knightley could not be found.
<p/>after the note I sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) this morning, and the message he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) returned, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) should certainly be at home till one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Very odd! very unaccountable! <div class="bookquote">``Donwell!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wife.--<div class="bookquote">``My dear Mr. E., you have not been to Donwell!--You mean the Crown; you come from the meeting at the Crown.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, no, that's to-morrow; and I particularly wanted to see Knightley to-day on that very account.--Such a dreadful broiling morning!--I
<p/>went over the fields too---LRB-speaking in a tone of great ill-usage,-RRB- which made it so much the worse. And then not to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) at home!
<p/>I assure you I am not at all pleased. And no apology left, no message for me. The housekeeper declared she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) knew nothing of my being expected.--Very extraordinary!--And
<p/>Perhaps to Hartfield, perhaps to the Abbey Mill, perhaps into his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) woods.--Miss Woodhouse, this is not like our friend Knightley!--Can you explain it?''
<p/>Emma amused herself by protesting that it was very extraordinary, indeed, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not a syllable to say for him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).
<p/>nobody knew at all which way he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was gone. '' I cannot imagine,'' said Mrs. Elton, -LRB-feeling the indignity as a wife ought to do,-RRB-
<p/>The very last person whom one should expect to be forgotten!--My dear Mr. E., he (<font color='blue'><b>E.</b></font>) must have left a message for you, I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>E.</b></font>) must.--Not
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot imagine how he (<font color='blue'><b>E.</b></font>) could do such a thing by you, of all people in the world! even Knightley could be so very eccentric;--and
<p/>Depend upon it, that was the case: and very likely to happen with the Donwell servants, who are all, I have often observed, extremely awkward and remiss.--I am sure I would not have such a creature as his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) Harry stand at our sideboard for any consideration.
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) servants forgot it. And as for Mrs. Hodges, Wright holds her (<font color='blue'><b>Hodges</b></font>) very cheap indeed.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Hodges</b></font>) promised Wright a receipt, and never sent it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I met William Larkins,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Elton, ``as I got near the house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) told me I should not find his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) master at home, but I did not believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).--William seemed rather out of humour.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) did not know what was come to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) master lately, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) could hardly ever get the speech of him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).
<p/>I have nothing to do with William's wants, but it really is of very great importance that I should see Knightley to-day; and it becomes a matter, therefore, of very serious inconvenience that I should have had this hot walk to no purpose.
<p/>In all probability she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was at this very time waited for there; and Mr. Knightley might be preserved from sinking deeper in aggression towards Mr. Elton, if not towards William Larkins.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was pleased, on taking leave, to find Miss Fairfax determined to attend her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) out of the room, to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) even downstairs; it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) an opportunity which she (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) immediately made use of, to say, <div class="bookquote">``It is as well, perhaps, that I have not had the possibility.

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh!''

<p/>I long to make apologies, excuses, to urge something for myself. I feel it so very due. But, unfortunately--in short, if your compassion does not stand my friend--

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XVII Mrs. Weston's friends were all made happy by her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) safety; and if the satisfaction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) well-doing could be increased to Emma, it was by knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be the mother of a little girl.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), hereafter, with either of Isabella's sons; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best.
<p/>It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) grew older--and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence--to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home; and
<p/>no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach, should not have their powers in exercise again.

<p/>I do not believe I did you any good. The good was all to myself, by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me.
<p/>I could not think about you so much without doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors, have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure you were of use to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma. '' I was very often influenced rightly by you--oftener than I would own at the time.
<p/>And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as you have done for me, except falling in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is thirteen.''
<p/>I am very sure you did me good. <div class="bookquote">``How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one of your saucy looks--`Mr.
<p/>Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says I may, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'--something which, you knew, I did not approve.
<p/>In such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What an amiable creature I was!--No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>'' ' Mr. Knightley.'--You always called me, `Mr. Knightley;' and, from habit, it has not so very formal a sound.--And
<p/>yet it is formal. I want you to call me something else, but I do not know what.'' <div class="bookquote">``I remember once calling you `George,' in one of my amiable fits, about ten years ago.
<p/>I did it because I thought it would offend you; but, as you made no objection, I never did it again.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton, by calling you Mr. K.--But I will promise,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) added presently, laughing and blushing--<div class="bookquote">``I will promise to call you once by your Christian name.
<p/>I do not say when, but perhaps you may guess where;--in the building in which N. takes M. for better, for worse.
<p/>Emma grieved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not be more openly just to one important service which his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) better sense would have rendered her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), to the advice which would have saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) from the worst of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) womanly follies--her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And cannot you call me `George' now?'' '' Impossible!--I never can call you any thing but `Mr. Knightley.' '' a subject.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not enter on it.--Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them.
<p/>This, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) side, might merely proceed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) not being thought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy, and a suspicion, from some appearances, that their friendship were declining.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was aware herself, that, parting under any other circumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, on Isabella's letters.
<p/>The pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), was very little inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.
<p/>Isabella sent quite as good an account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) visitor as could be expected; on her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) first arrival she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) out of spirits, which appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to be consulted; but, since that business had been over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) did not appear to find Harriet different from what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) before.--Isabella, to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children, it would not have escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).
<p/>Emma's comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet's being to stay longer; her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) fortnight was likely to be a month at least.
<p/>Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was invited to remain till they could bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) back.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might observe that it was so. '' John does not even mention your friend,'' said Mr. Knightley. '' Here is his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) answer, if you like to see it.
<p/>Emma accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend was unmentioned.
<p/>John enters like a brother into my happiness,'' continued Mr. Knightley, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is no complimenter; and though I well know him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to have, likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is so far from making flourishes, that any other young woman might think him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) rather cool in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) praise.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>It was the answer to the communication of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) intended marriage. '' But I am not afraid of your seeing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) writes.''
<p/>It is very plain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is not without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection, as you think me already.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) writes like a sensible man,'' replied Emma, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had read the letter. '' I honour his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) sincerity. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) said any thing to bear a different construction, I should not have believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>interrupted she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), with a sort of serious smile--<div class="bookquote">``much less, perhaps, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried with more thorough gaiety, <div class="bookquote">``if you fancy your brother does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in the secret, and hear his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) opinion.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>My Emma, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) means no such thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) only means-- <div class="bookquote">``Emma, my dear Emma-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Oh! Depend upon it, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will be much farther from doing you justice.
<p/>I wish I may not sink into `poor Emma' with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at once.--His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will think all the happiness, all the advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit on mine. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give, to be happy together.
<p/>I am amused by one part of John's letter--did you notice it?--where he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) says, that my information did not take him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wholly by surprize, that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' If I understand your brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had no idea of me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) seems perfectly unprepared for that.'' '' Yes, yes--but I am amused that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should have seen so far into my feelings.
<p/>What has he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) been judging by?--I am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) at this time for my marrying any more than at
<p/>another.--But it was so, I suppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them the other day.
<p/>I believe I did not play with the children quite so much as usual. I remember one evening the poor boys saying, `Uncle seems always tired now.'
<p/>As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved first to announce it at home, and then at Randalls.--But how to break it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father at last!--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of Mr. Knightley's absence, or when it came to the point her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart would have failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time, and follow up the beginning she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was to make.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was forced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too.
<p/>'' The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other persons' reception of it tried. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), by a melancholy tone herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must not appear to think it a misfortune.--With all the spirits she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could command, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) prepared him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) first for something strange, and then, in a few words, said, that if his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) consent and approbation could be obtained--which, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) trusted, would be attended with no difficulty, since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and Mr. Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person's company whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) loved, next to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the world.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was reminded, more than once, of having always said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would never marry, and assured that it would be a great deal better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to remain single; and told of poor Isabella, and poor Miss Taylor.--But it would not do.
<p/>Emma hung about him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) must not class her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages taking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not going from Hartfield; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) should be always there; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) was very sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were once got used to the idea.--Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) not love Mr. Knightley very much?--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)
<p/>would not deny that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) did, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) was sure.--Whom did he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) ever want to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?--Who was so useful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), who so ready to write his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) letters, who so glad to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)?--Who so cheerful, so attentive, so attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)?--Would not he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) like to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) always on the spot?--Yes.
<p/>Poor man!--it was at first a considerable shock to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried earnestly to dissuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) from it. That was all very true.
<p/>Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) should be glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) every day;--but they did see him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) every day as it was.--Why
<p/>Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome, the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.--To Emma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's, whose fond praise of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was soon used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.--They had all the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to consider the subject in the most serviceable light--first, as a settled, and, secondly, as a good one--well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.--It was agreed upon, as what was to be; and every body by whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was used to be guided assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) that it would be for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) happiness; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) began to think that some time or other--in another year or two, perhaps--it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place.
<p/>Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) in favour of the event.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been extremely surprized, never more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had no scruple in urging him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to the utmost.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
<p/>had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, as to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) deserved even her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dearest Emma; and it was in every respect so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one respect, one point of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible, so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it long ago.--How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield!
<p/>And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement desirable!--The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always felt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband's plans and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own, for a marriage between Frank and Emma.
<p/>How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had been a continual impediment--less acknowledged by Mr. Weston than by herself--but even he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying--<div class="bookquote">``Those matters will take care of themselves; the young people will find a way.
<p/>could not they go on as they had done? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future.
<p/>It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, and without one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.
<p/>Mrs. Weston, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) baby on her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) knee, indulging in such reflections as these, was one of the happiest women in the world.
<p/>If any thing could increase her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) delight, it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps.
<p/>The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr. Weston had his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) quickness of mind.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) saw the advantages of the match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was not far from believing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had always foreseen it.
<p/>It was all right, all open, all equal. No sacrifice on any side worth the name. '' It is to be a secret, I conclude,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).
<p/>'' These matters are always a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them. Only let me be told when I may speak out.--I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion.
<p/>Was not she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) like a daughter, his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) eldest daughter?--he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must tell her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); and Miss Bates being present, it passed, of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediately afterwards.
<p/>It was no more than the principals were prepared for; they had calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls, how soon it would be over Highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as the evening wonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on that point. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) the news. In general, it was a very well approved match.
<p/>One set might recommend their all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys; and another might predict disagreements among their servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious objection raised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.--There, the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction.
<p/>Mr. Elton cared little about it, compared with his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wife; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) only hoped <div class="bookquote">``the young lady's pride would now be contented;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and supposed <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had always meant to catch Knightley if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and, on the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim,
<p/>Some might think him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), and others might think her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), the most in luck. <div class="bookquote">``Rather he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) than I!'' (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>--But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--<div class="bookquote">``Poor Knightley!
<p/>poor fellow!--sad business for him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).'' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>--She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was extremely concerned; for, though very eccentric, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had a thousand good qualities.--How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) be so taken
<p/>in?--Did not think him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) at all in love--not in the least.--Poor Knightley!--There would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).--How happy he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)!
<p/>But that would be all over now.--Poor fellow!--No more exploring parties to Donwell made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) . Oh! no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every thing.--Extremely disagreeable!
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was not at all sorry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had abused the housekeeper the other day.--Shocking plan, living together. It would never do.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) knew a family near Maple Grove who had tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter.
<p/>It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of it one morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts were put by.
<p/>CHAPTER XVIII Time passed on. A few more to-morrows, and the party from London would be arriving. After the first chat of pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was silent; and then, in a graver tone, began with,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have something to tell you, Emma; some news. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good or bad? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), quickly, looking up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) face.
<p/>'' I do not know which it ought to be called.'' '' Oh! good I am sure.--I see it in your countenance.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), composing his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) features, ``I am very much afraid, my dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! but why so?--I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too.
<p/>You are trying not to smile. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' There is one subject,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``I hope but one, on which we do not think alike.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) paused a moment, again smiling, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) eyes fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face. '' Does nothing occur to you?--Do not you recollect?--Harriet Smith.
<p/>'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) cheeks flushed at the name, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) felt afraid of something, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) knew not what. '' Have you heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) yourself this morning?
<p/>'' cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). '' You have, I believe, and know the whole.'' '' No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me.''
<p/>Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes, in eager gaze, said, ``No, this is impossible!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are prepared for the worst, I see--and very bad it is. Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' but her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) lips were closed.
<p/>'' It is so, indeed,'' continued Mr. Knightley; <div class="bookquote">``I have it from Robert Martin himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) left me not half an hour ago.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was still looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) with the most speaking amazement. '' You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.--I wish our opinions were the same.
<p/>Time, you may be sure, will make one or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need not talk much on the subject.''
<p/>But in time they will. '' You mistake me, you quite mistake me,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied, exerting herself. '' It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but I cannot believe it.
<p/>It seems an impossibility!--You cannot mean to say, that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin. You cannot mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has even proposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) again--yet.
<p/>You only mean, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) intends it. '' '' I mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has done it,'' answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling but determined decision, <div class="bookquote">``and been accepted.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) cried.--<div class="bookquote">``Well!'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--Then having recourse to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) workbasket, in excuse for leaning down her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) face, and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must be expressing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) added, ``Well, now tell me every thing; make this intelligible to me.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good God! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>How, where, when?--Let me know it all. I never was more surprized--but it does not make me unhappy
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went to town on business three days ago, and I got him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to John.--He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) delivered these papers to John, at his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) chambers, and was asked by him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to join their party the same evening to Astley's.
<p/>, I assure you.--How--how has it been possible?'' <div class="bookquote">``It is a very simple story. They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley's.
<p/>They called for him (<font color='blue'><b>Astley</b></font>) in their way; were all extremely amused; and my brother asked him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to dine with them the next day--which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did--and in the course of that visit -LRB-as I understand-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak in vain.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), by her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) acceptance, as happy even as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is deserving.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) came down by yesterday's coach, and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast, to report his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) proceedings, first on my affairs, and then on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own.
<p/>The party was to be our brother and sister, Henry, John--and Miss Smith. My friend Robert could not resist. This is all that I can relate of the how, where, and when.
<p/>Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).--She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) will give you all the minute particulars, which only woman's language can make interesting.--In our communications we deal only in the great.--However, I must say, that Robert Martin's heart seemed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) , and to me , very overflowing; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) did mention, without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their box at Astley's, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and little John, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) followed with Miss Smith and Henry; and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) stopped.--Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) silence disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>); and after observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) a little while, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) added, ``Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) situation is an evil--but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as you know him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) more.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) good sense and good principles would delight you.--As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend in better hands.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) rank in society I would alter if I could, which is saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.--You laugh at me about William Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly--she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did--cheerfully answering, <div class="bookquote">``You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must wait a moment, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) would think her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mad. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I think Harriet is doing extremely well. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) connexions may be worse than his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) .
<p/>In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they are. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize.
<p/>You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly unprepared I was!--for I had reason to believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) very lately more determined against him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), much more, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was before.
<p/>I should say she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be very, very determined against any young man who told her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).
<p/>Emma could not help laughing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, I believe you know her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quite as well as I do.--But, Mr. Knightley, are you perfectly sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) has absolutely and downright accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' You ought to know your friend best,'' replied Mr. Knightley; <div class="bookquote">``but ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley/Mr. John Knightley</b></font>)</div>I could suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might in time--but
<p/>can she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) already?--Did not you misunderstand him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)?--You were both talking of other things; of business, shows of cattle, or new drills--and might not you, in the confusion of so many subjects, mistake him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)?--It was not Harriet's hand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was certain of
<p/>The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's feelings, and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet's side, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such emphasis,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith/Smith</b></font>)</div>that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was really expecting the intelligence to prove, in some measure, premature.
<p/>--it was the dimensions of some famous ox. '' It could not be otherwise. '' Do you dare say this?'' cried Mr. Knightley.
<p/>'' Do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?--What do you deserve?''
<p/>Oh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am quite sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied, speaking very distinctly, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told me she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and that there was no obscurity, nothing doubtful, in the words he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) asked my opinion as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was now to do.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could apply for information of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) relations or friends. Could I mention any thing more fit to be done, than to go to Mrs. Goddard?
<p/>I assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) that I could not. Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) would endeavour to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) in the course of this day.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am perfectly satisfied,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Emma, with the brightest smiles, <div class="bookquote">``and most sincerely wish them happy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hope so--for at that time I was a fool.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all Harriet's good qualities.
<p/>I have taken some pains for your sake, and for Robert Martin's sake, -LRB-whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) as ever,-RRB- to get acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).
<p/>I have often talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) a good deal. You must have seen that I did. Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin's
<p/>cause, which was never the case; but, from all my observations, I am convinced of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) being an artless, amiable girl, with very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.--Much of this, I have no doubt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) may thank you for.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head.--<div class="bookquote">``Ah! poor Harriet! ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) deserved.
<p/>Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not sorry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) wanted to be alone.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and till she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed and reflected, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could be fit for nothing rational.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father's business was to announce James's being gone out to put the horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mind was in a state of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to be collected. The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) sensations may be imagined.
<p/>The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet's welfare, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was really in danger of becoming too happy for security.--What had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to wish for?
<p/>Nothing, but to grow more worthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own. Nothing, but that the lessons of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) past folly might teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) humility and circumspection in future.
<p/>Serious she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was, very serious in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thankfulness, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) resolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the very midst of them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) must laugh at such a close! Such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart--such a Harriet!
<p/>Now there would be pleasure in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) returning-- Every thing would be a pleasure. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.
<p/>High in the rank of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) most serious and heartfelt felicities, was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would soon be over.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could now look forward to giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) that full and perfect confidence which her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty.
<p/>In the gayest and happiest spirits she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) set forward with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father; not always listening, but always agreeing to what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said; and, whether in speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) being obliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed.
<p/>Weston was alone in the drawing-room:--but hardly had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks for coming, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the blind, of two figures passing near the window.
<p/>The disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to practise, might soon be over. They arrived.--Mrs. '' It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,'' said Mrs. Weston.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us.--They are coming in, I hope.
<p/>'' I was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) arrive this morning. '' In half a minute they were in the room.
<p/>They met readily and smiling, but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all sat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle, that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had long felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) with Jane, would yield its proportion of pleasure.
<p/>When Mr. Weston joined the party, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer a want of subject or animation--or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) and say, <div class="bookquote">``I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message in one of Mrs. Weston's letters.
<p/>Emma was extremely glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)--but there was a degree of confusion--a number of embarrassing recollections on each side. I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon.
<p/>I hope you do not retract what you then said. ''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>'' No, indeed,'' cried Emma, most happy to begin, <div class="bookquote">``not in the least.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) heart, and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) gratitude and happiness.
<p/>I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you--and to give you joy in person. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>'' Is not she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looking well?'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) eyes towards Jane.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) named the name of Dixon.--Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hearing.
<p/>'' Better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ever used to do?--You see how my father and Mrs. Weston doat upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). '' '' I can never think of it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``without extreme shame.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The shame,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``is all mine, or ought to be. But is it possible that you had no suspicion?--I mean of late.
<p/>Early, I know, you had none.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I never had the smallest, I assure you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' That appears quite wonderful. I was once very near--and I wish I had--it would have been better.
<p/>But though I was always doing wrong things, they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.--It would have been a much better transgression
<p/>had I broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing.'' <div class="bookquote">``It is not now worth a regret,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma.
<p/>I have some hope,'' resumed he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``of my uncle's being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls; he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wants to be introduced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
<p/>When the Campbells are returned, we shall meet them in London, and continue there, I trust, till we may carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) northward.--But now, I am at such a distance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)--is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?--Till this morning, we have not once met since the day of reconciliation.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Do not you pity me? '' Emma spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cried,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! by the bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>then sinking his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) voice, and looking demure for the moment--<div class="bookquote">``I hope Mr. Knightley is well? ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) paused.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) coloured and laughed.--``I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wish in your favour.
<p/>Let me return your congratulations.--I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is a man whom I cannot presume to praise.
<p/>Emma was delighted, and only wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to go on in the same style; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) mind was the next moment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own concerns and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own Jane, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) next words were, <div class="bookquote">``Did you ever see such a skin?--such smoothness!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax/Miss Jane Fairfax</b></font>)</div>such delicacy!--and yet without being actually fair.--One cannot call her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) fair. It is a most uncommon complexion, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) dark eye-lashes and hair--a most distinguishing complexion!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have always admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) complexion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Emma, archly; <div class="bookquote">``but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) for being so pale?--When
<p/>So peculiarly the lady in it.--Just colour enough for beauty. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>we first began to talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).--Have you quite forgotten?''
<p/>'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could not help saying, <div class="bookquote">``I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, you had very great amusement in tricking us all.--I am sure you had.--I am sure it was a consolation to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh! no-- what an impudent dog I was!--How could I dare-- '' Oh! no, no, no--how can you suspect me of such a thing?
<p/>I am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking us all in.--Perhaps
<p/>I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell you the truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation.
<p/>I was the most miserable wretch!'' <div class="bookquote">``Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I think there is a little likeness between us.
<p/>If not in our dispositions,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) presently added, with a look of true sensibility, <div class="bookquote">``there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bowed. '' <div class="bookquote">``True, true,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) answered, warmly. '' No, not true on your side. You can have no superior, but most true on mine.--She (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) is a complete angel.
<p/>Observe her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) eyes, as she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) is looking up at my father.--You will be glad to hear -LRB-inclining his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head, and whispering seriously-RRB- that my uncle means to give her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) all my aunt's jewels.
<p/>Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>). Is not she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn of her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) throat. They are to be new set.
<p/>I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head. Will not it be beautiful in her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) dark hair?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very beautiful, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Emma; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) spoke so kindly, that he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) gratefully burst out, <div class="bookquote">``How delighted I am to see you again!
<p/>and to see you in such excellent looks!--I would not have missed this meeting for the world. I should certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come.
<p/>The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an account of a little alarm she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been under, the evening before, from the infant's appearing not quite well.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been foolish, but it had alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been within half a minute of sending for Mr. Perry.
<p/>Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) ought to be ashamed, but Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.--In ten minutes, however, the child had been perfectly well again.
<p/>This was her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) history; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) very much for thinking of sending for Perry, and only regretted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had not done it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should always send for Perry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment.
<p/>It was a pity, perhaps, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now, very well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry had seen it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could not be too soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. '' Frank Churchill caught the name.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perry!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) to Emma, and trying, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) spoke, to catch Miss Fairfax's eye. '' My friend Mr. Perry! What are they saying about Mr. Perry?--Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) been here this morning?--And
<p/>Emma soon recollected, and understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>); and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) joined in the laugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) too was really hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>), though trying to seem deaf.
<p/>how does he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) travel now?--Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) set up his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) carriage? '' '' Such an extraordinary dream of mine! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) cried.
<p/>'' I can never think of it without laughing.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) hears us, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) hears us, Miss Woodhouse. I see it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) cheek, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) smile, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) vain attempt to frown.
<p/>Do not you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own letter, which sent me the report, is passing under her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) eye--that the whole blunder is spread before her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) can attend to nothing else, though pretending to listen to the others?
<p/>Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partly remained as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), and said in a conscious, low, yet steady voice, <div class="bookquote">``How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!--They will sometimes obtrude--but how you can court them!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; but Emma's feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on leaving Randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) felt, that pleased as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had been to see Frank Churchill, and really regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did with friendship, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had never been more sensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of character.
<p/>The happiness of this most happy day, received its completion, in the animated contemplation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) worth which this comparison produced.
<p/>If Emma had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for Harriet, a momentary doubt of its being possible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to be really cured of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) attachment to Mr. Knightley, and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination, it was not long that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty.
<p/>A very few days brought the party from London, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with Harriet, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) became perfectly satisfied--unaccountable as it was!--that Robert Martin had thoroughly supplanted Mr. Knightley, and was now forming all her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) views of happiness.
<p/>Harriet was a little distressed--did look a little foolish at first: but having once owned that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been presumptuous and silly, and self-deceived, before, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words, and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) without a care for the past, and with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend's approbation, Emma had instantly removed every fear of that nature, by meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with the most unqualified congratulations.--Harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at Astley's, and the dinner the next day; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could dwell on it all with the utmost delight.
<p/>But what did such particulars explain?--The fact was, as Emma could now acknowledge, that Harriet had always liked Robert Martin; and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) continuing to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been irresistible.--Beyond this, it must ever be unintelligible to Emma.
<p/>Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). '' CHAPTER XIX The event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fresh reason for thinking so.--Harriet's parentage became known.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to have always wished for concealment.--Such was the blood of gentility which Emma had formerly been so ready to vouch for!--It was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what a connexion had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) been preparing for Mr. Knightley--or for the Churchills--or even for Mr. Elton!--The stain of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.
<p/>No objection was raised on the father's side; the young man was treated liberally; it was all as it should be: and as Emma became acquainted with Robert Martin, who was now introduced at Hartfield, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fully acknowledged in him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) little friend.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had no doubt of Harriet's happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and in the home he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) offered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, and improvement.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would be placed in the midst of those who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), and who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would be respectable and happy; and Emma admitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be the luckiest creature in the world, to have created so steady and persevering an affection in such a man;--or, if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.
<p/>Harriet, necessarily drawn away by her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) engagements with the Martins, was less and less at Hartfield; which was not to be regretted.--The
<p/>intimacy between her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) and Emma must sink; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be, and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural manner.
<p/>Before the end of September, Emma attended Harriet to church, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand bestowed on Robert Martin with so complete a satisfaction, as no remembrances, even connected with Mr. Elton as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) stood before them, could impair.--Perhaps, indeed, at that time she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) scarcely saw Mr. Elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself.--Robert Martin and Harriet Smith, the latest couple engaged of the three, were the first to be married.
<p/>Jane Fairfax had already quitted Highbury, and was restored to the comforts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) beloved home with the Campbells.--The Mr. Churchills were also in town; and they were only waiting for November.
<p/>The intermediate month was the one fixed on, as far as they dared, by Emma and Mr. Knightley.--They had determined that their marriage ought to be concluded while John and Isabella were still at Hartfield, to allow them the fortnight's absence in a tour to the seaside, which was the plan.--John and Isabella, and every other friend, were agreed in approving it.
<p/>But Mr. Woodhouse--how was Mr. Woodhouse to be induced to consent?--he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), who had never yet alluded to their marriage but as a distant event.
<p/>When first sounded on the subject, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was so miserable, that they were almost hopeless.--A second allusion, indeed, gave less pain.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) began to think it was to be, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could not prevent it--a very promising step of the mind on its way to resignation.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would be never led into temptation, nor left for it to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) out. Still, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was not happy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could not bear to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) suffering, to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) fancying himself neglected; and though her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) understanding almost acquiesced in the assurance of both the Mr. Knightleys, that when once the event were over, his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightleys</b></font>) distress would be soon over too, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) hesitated--she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could not proceed.
<p/>In this state of suspense they were befriended, not by any sudden illumination of Mr. Woodhouse's mind, or any wonderful change of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) nervous system, but by the operation of the same system in another way.--Mrs.
<p/>Nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) appeared so much otherwise, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter's courage failed. Weston's poultry-house was robbed one night of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) turkeys--evidently by the ingenuity of man.
<p/>Mr. Woodhouse's fears.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was very uneasy; and but for the sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) son-in-law's protection, would have been under wretched alarm every night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) life.
<p/>Other poultry-yards in the neighbourhood also suffered.--Pilfering was housebreaking to The strength, resolution, and presence of mind of the Mr. Knightleys, commanded his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightleys</b></font>) fullest dependence.
<p/>While either of them protected him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightleys</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightleys</b></font>), Hartfield was safe.--But Mr. John Knightley must be in London again by the end of the first week in November.
<p/>The result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary, cheerful consent than his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was able to fix her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) wedding-day--and Mr. Elton was called on, within a month from the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Robert Martin, to join the hands of Mr. Knightley and Miss Woodhouse.
<p/>The wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have no taste for finery or parade; and Mrs. Elton, from the particulars detailed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very inferior to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own.--<div class="bookquote">``Very little white satin, very few lace veils; a most pitiful business!--Selina would stare when she (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) heard of it.'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--But, in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence, the predictions of the small band of true friends who witnessed the ceremony, were fully answered in the perfect happiness of the union.
