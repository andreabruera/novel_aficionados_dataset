very great mortification and regret ; but still he looked forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period . Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed -- much more disappointed , in fact , than her husband , though her dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober : but a sanguine temper , though for ever expecting more good than occurs , does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression . For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and sorry ; but then he began to perceive that Frank 's coming two or three months later would be a much better plan ; better time of year ; better weather ; and that he would be able , without any doubt , to stay considerably longer with them than if he had come sooner . These feelings rapidly restored his comfort , while Mrs. Weston , of a more apprehensive disposition , foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays ; and after all her concern for what her husband was to suffer , suffered a great deal more herself . Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr. Frank Churchill 's not coming , except as a disappointment at Randalls . '' ","i":55245},{"w":"`` How odd you are !

There is one thing , Emma , which a man can always do , if he chuses , and that is , his duty ; not by manoeuvring and finessing , but by vigour and resolution .

They combated the point some time longer in the same way ; Emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend ; for Mrs. Weston was the most used of the two to yield ; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over , and the instrument in preparation ; -- and at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it . Frank Churchill , of whom , in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs. Weston , she had been seeing nothing , except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax , followed Mr. Cole , to add his very pressing entreaties ; and as , in every respect , it suited Emma best to lead , she gave a very proper compliance .

Emma was most happy to be called to such a council ; and her father , engaging to think it all over while she was gone , the two young people set off together without delay for the Crown . There were Mr. and Mrs. Weston ; delighted to see her and receive her approbation , very busy and very happy in their different way ; she , in some little distress ; and he , finding every thing perfect . in places you see it is dreadfully dirty ; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined .

A little quickness of voice there is which rather hurts the ear . However , she seems a very obliging , pretty-behaved young lady , and no doubt will make him a very good wife .

Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith ? -- that you have never thought seriously of her ? '' ","i":50927},{"w":"`` actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man . Oh ! that I had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young Martin . There I was quite right . That was well done of me ; but there I should have stopped , and left the rest to time and chance . I was introducing her into good company , and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having ; I ought not to have attempted more . I have been but half a friend to her ; and if she were not to feel this disappointment so very much , I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her ; -- William Coxe -- Oh ! But now , poor girl , her peace is cut up for some time . no , I could not endure William Coxe -- a pert young lawyer . She stopt to blush and laugh at her own relapse , and then resumed a more serious , more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been , and might be , and must be . The distressing explanation she had to make to Harriet , and all that poor Harriet would be suffering , with the awkwardness of future meetings , the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance , of subduing feelings , concealing resentment , and avoiding eclat , were enough to occupy her in most unmirthful reflections some time longer , and she went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her having blundered most dreadfully . To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma 's , though under temporary gloom at night , the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits . The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy , and of powerful operation ; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed , they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope . Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed , more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her , and to depend on getting tolerably out of it . It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love with her , or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him -- that Harriet 's nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive -- and that there could be no necessity for any body 's knowing what had passed except the three principals , and especially for her father 's being given a moment 's uneasiness about it . These were very cheering thoughts ; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her further service , for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present . Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his daughter attempted it , and she was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas . The ground covered with snow , and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw , which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise , every morning beginning in rain or snow , and every evening setting in to freeze , she was for many days a most honourable prisoner . No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note ; no church for her on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day ; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton 's absenting himself . It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home ; and though she hoped and believed him to be really taking comfort in some society or other , it was very pleasant to have her father so well satisfied with his being all alone in his own house , too wise to stir out ; and to hear him say to Mr. Knightley , whom no weather could keep entirely from them , -- '' ","i":52995},{"w":"`` but perhaps there might be some made to his coming back again . Such language for a young man entirely dependent , to use ! -- Nobody but you , Mr. Knightley , would imagine it possible . Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt , who have brought him up , and are to provide for him ! -- Standing up in the middle of the room , I suppose , and speaking as loud as he could ! -- How But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own . can you imagine such conduct practicable ? '' ","i":56446},{"w":"`` We shall never agree about him , '' ","i":57175},{"w":"`` but that is nothing extraordinary . Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly , though in his own son ; but he is very likely to have a more yielding , complying , mild disposition than would suit your notions of man 's perfection . I dare say he has ; and though it may cut him off from some advantages , it will secure him many others .

I thought I should have fainted . I did not know what to do . I was sitting near the door -- Elizabeth saw me directly ; but he did not ; he was busy with the umbrella . I am sure she saw me , but she looked away directly , and took no notice ; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop ; and I kept sitting near the door ! -- Oh ! I could not go away you know , because of the rain ; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there . -- Oh ! dear ; I was so miserable ! I am sure I must have been as white as my gown . dear , Miss Woodhouse -- well , at last , I fancy , he looked round and saw me ; for instead of going on with her buyings , they began whispering to one another . I am sure they were talking of me ; and I could not help thinking that he was persuading her to speak to me -- -LRB- do you think he was , Miss Woodhouse ? -RRB- -- for presently she came forward -- came quite up to me , and asked me how I did , and seemed ready to shake hands , if I would . She did not do any of it in the same way that she used ; I could see she was altered ; but , however , she seemed to try to be very friendly , and we shook hands , and stood talking some time ; but I know no more what I said -- I was in such a tremble ! -- I remember she said she was sorry we never met now ; which I thought almost too kind ! By that time , it was beginning to hold up , and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away -- and then -- only think ! -- I found he was coming up towards me too -- slowly you know , and as if he did not quite know what to do ; and so he came and spoke , and I answered -- and I stood for a minute , feeling dreadfully , you know , one ca n't tell how ; and then I took courage , and said it did not rain , and I must go ; and so off I set ; and I had not got three yards from the door , when he came after me , only to say , if I was going to Hartfield , he thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole 's stables , for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain . Dear , Miss Woodhouse , I was absolutely miserable ! Oh ! dear , I thought it would have been the death of me ! So I said , I was very much obliged to him : you know I could not do less ; and then he went back to Elizabeth , and I came round by the stables -- I believe I did -- but I hardly knew where I was , or any thing about it . Oh ! Miss Woodhouse , I would rather done any thing than have it happen : and yet , you know , there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him behave so pleasantly and so kindly .

She often says , when the letter is first opened , ` Well , Hetty , now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work ' -- do n't you , ma'am ? -- And then I tell her , I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself , if she had nobody to do it for her -- And , indeed , though my mother 's eyes are not so good as they were , she can see amazingly well still , thank God ! with the help of spectacles . every word of it -- I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word . It is such a blessing ! Jane often says , when she is here , ' I am sure , grandmama , you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do -- and so much fine work as you have done too ! -- I only wish my eyes may last me as well .

I do not pretend to it . What is before me , I see . At the same time , nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired -- Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on , so good-humouredly . She knows I would not offend for the world . How does Miss Smith do ? She seems quite recovered now . Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately ? Oh ! those dear little children .

Mrs. Weston , capital in her country-dances , was seated , and beginning an irresistible waltz ; and Frank Churchill , coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma , had secured her hand , and led her up to the top .

'' ","i":47721},{"w":"`` Would not she give him her support ? -- would not she add her persuasions to his , to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard 's till it were certain that Miss Smith 's disorder had no infection ? He could not be satisfied without a promise -- would not she give him her influence in procuring it ? '' ","i":48261},{"w":"`` How d'ye do ? -- how Frank comes to-morrow -- I had a letter this morning -- we see him to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty -- he is at Oxford to-day , and he comes for a whole fortnight If he had come at Christmas he could not have staid three days ; I was always glad he did not come at Christmas ; now we are going to have just the right weather for him , fine , dry , settled weather . d'ye do ? -- We have been sitting with your father -- glad to see him so well . ; I knew it would be so . We shall enjoy him completely ; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish . There was no resisting such news , no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston 's , confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his wife , fewer and quieter , but not less to the purpose . To know that she thought his coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so , and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy . The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming ; and in the rapidity of half a moment 's thought , she hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more . Mr. Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe , which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command , as well as the route and the method of his journey ; and she listened , and smiled , and congratulated . '' ","i":72277},{"w":"`` Think of me to-morrow , my dear Emma , about four o'clock , '' ","i":72702},{"w":"`` always overcareful for every body 's comfort but your own ; I see you now in all your little fidgets , going again and again into his room , to be sure that all is right . ; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence ; and by this time to-morrow , perhaps , or a little later , I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here . '' ","i":72971},{"w":"`` You get upon delicate subjects , Emma , '' ","i":77447},{"w":"`` remember that I am here . -- Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax 's situation in life .

With the exception of this little blot , Emma found that his visit hitherto had given her friend only good ideas of him . Mrs. Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he made himself -- how much she saw to like in his disposition altogether . He appeared to have a very open temper -- certainly a very cheerful and lively one ; she could observe nothing wrong in his notions , a great deal decidedly right ; he spoke of his uncle with warm regard , was fond of talking of him -- said he would be the best man in the world if he were left to himself ; and though there was no being attached to the aunt , he acknowledged her kindness with gratitude , and seemed to mean always to speak of her with respect . This was all very promising ; and , but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his hair cut , there was nothing to denote him unworthy of the distinguished honour which her imagination had given him ; the honour , if not of being really in love with her , of being at least very near it , and saved only by her own indifference -- -LRB- for still her resolution held of never marrying -RRB- -- the honour , in short , of being marked out for her by all their joint acquaintance .

He could say no more ; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him , returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates 's door . Emma watched them in , and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter , -- trying , with all the force of her own mind , to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured ; and that a blue ribbon , be it ever so beautiful , would still never match her yellow pattern . and I always thought you meant it .
