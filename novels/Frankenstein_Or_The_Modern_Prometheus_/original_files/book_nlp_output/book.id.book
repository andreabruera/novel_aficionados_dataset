It is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed forever -- that the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed , never more to be heard .

Before , I looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that I read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils ; at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination ; but now misery has come home , and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each other 's blood . Everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty ; and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered , assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures . For the sake of a few jewels , to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend , a child whom she had nursed from its birth , and appeared to love as if it had been her own ! Yet I am certainly unjust . I could not consent to the death of any human being , but certainly I should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men . But she was innocent . I know , I feel she was innocent ; you are of the same opinion , and that confirms me . I feel as if I were walking on the edge of a precipice , towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss . Alas ! Victor , when falsehood can look so like the truth , who can assure themselves of certain happiness ?

Such as the peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes , his cottage burnt , his lands laid waste , and he is turned adrift , homeless , penniless , and alone , but free . Such would be my liberty except that in my Elizabeth I possessed a treasure , alas , balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death . I read and reread her letter , and some softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy ; but the apple was already eaten , and the angel 's arm bared to drive me from all hope . If he were vanquished , I should be a free man . Alas ! What freedom ? Sweet and beloved Elizabeth ! Yet I would die to make her happy . My destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner , but if my torturer should suspect that I postponed it , influenced by his menaces , he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge . He had vowed TO BE WITH ME ON MY WEDDING-NIGHT , yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime , for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood , he had murdered Clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats . I resolved , therefore , that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my father 's happiness , my adversary 's designs against my life should not retard it a single hour .
