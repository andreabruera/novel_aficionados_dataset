the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ french le comte de $m_de_monte_cristo$ is an adventure novel by french author alexandre dumas père completed in
it is one of the author more popular works along with the three musketeers like many of his novels it was expanded from plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter auguste maquet
another important work by dumas written before his work with maquet was the short novel georges this novel is of particular interest to scholars because dumas reused many of the ideas and plot devices later in the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
the story takes place in france italy and islands in the mediterranean during the historical events of the era of the bourbon restoration through the reign of $louis_xviii$ philippe of france
the historical setting is fundamental element of the book an adventure story primarily concerned with themes of hope justice vengeance mercy and forgiveness
it centres on man who is wrongfully imprisoned escapes from jail acquires fortune and sets about exacting revenge on those responsible for his imprisonment
it begins just before the hundred #day# period when $napoleon$ returned to power after his exile his plans have devastating consequences for both the innocent and the guilty
according to luc sante the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ has become fixture of western civilization literature as inescapable and immediately identifiable as mickey mouse noah flood and the story of little red riding hood
chronology of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ and bonapartism dumas wrote that the idea of revenge in the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ came from story in book compiled by jacques peuchet french police archivist published in after the death of the author
peuchet told of shoemaker pierre picaud living in nîmes in who was engaged to marry rich woman when three jealous friends falsely accused him of being spy for england
picaud was placed under form of $house_of_peers$ arrest in the fenestrelle fort where he served as servant to rich italian cleric
the book is considered literary classic today dumas included this essay in one of the editions from when the cleric died he left his fortune to picaud whom he had begun to treat as son
picaud then spent years plotting his revenge on the three men who were responsible for his misfortune he stabbed the first with dagger on which were printed the words number one and then he poisoned the second
the third man son he lured into crime and his daughter into prostitution finally stabbing the man himself this third man named loupian had married picaud fiancée while picaud was under arrest
this story also quoted in the pleiade edition obviously served as model for the #chapter# of the murders inside the $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ family
the introduction to the pleiade edition mentions other sources from real life $abbé_faria$ existed and died in after life with much resemblance to that of the $abbé_faria$ in the novel
as for $m_dantès$ his fate is quite different from his model in peuchet book since the latter is murdered by the $m_caderousse$ of the plot
but $m_dantès$ has alter egos in two other dumas works in pauline from and more significantly in georges from where young man with black ancestry is preparing revenge against white #people# who had humiliated him

$m_de_monte_cristo$ at théâtre historique alexandre dumas and auguste maquet wrote set of four plays that collectively told the story of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ $m_de_monte_cristo$ part $m_de_monte_cristo$ part ii le comte de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
the first two plays were first performed at dumas own théâtre historique in february with the performance spread over two #night# each with long duration the first evening ran from until
the play was also unsuccessfully performed at drury lane in london later that year where rioting erupted in protest at french companies performing in england
the adaptation differs from the novel in many #respect# several characters such as $luigi_vampa$ are excluded whereas the novel includes many different plot threads that are brought together at the conclusion the third and fourth plays deal only with the fate of $m_fernand_mondego$ and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ respectively $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ fate is not featured at all the play is the first to feature $m_dantès$ shouting the world is mine
$m_de_monte_cristo$ and his wife presumably by jacob ralph abarbanell countess of $m_de_monte_cristo$ by abarbanell premiere of dumas an iconic line that would be used in many future adaptations
poster for production of charles fechter adaptation of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ starring james neill two english adaptations of the novel were published in
the first by hailes lacy differs only slightly from dumas version with the main change being that $m_fernand_mondego$ is killed in duel with the #count# rather than committing suicide
the play faithfully follows the first part of the novel omits the rome section and makes several sweeping changes to the third part among the most significant being that $m_albert_de_morcerf$ is actually the son of $m_dantès$
the fates of the three main antagonists are also altered $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ whose fate is dealt with quite early on in the play kills himself after being foiled by the #count# trying to kill $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #half# #brother# in this version $m_fernand_mondego$ kills himself after being confronted by mercedes $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is killed by the #count# in duel
much more radical was the version by charles fechter notable french anglo actor the ending sees $m_dantès$ and mercedes reunited and the character of haydee is not featured at all
the original duration was five #hour# resulting in fechter abridging the play which despite negative reviews had respectable sixteen week run
fechter moved to the united states in and $m_de_monte_cristo$ was chosen for the inaugural play at the opening of the globe theatre boston in
in john stetson manager of the booth theatre and the globe theatre wanted to revive the play and asked james neill the #father# of playwright eugene neill to perform the lead role
o neill who had never seen fechter perform made the role his own and the play became commercial if not an artistic success
the play was first performed at the adelphi in london in october fechter last performed the role in neill made several abridgements to the play and eventually bought it from stetson
a motion picture based on fechter play with neill in the title role was released in but was not huge success
o neill died in two years before more successful motion picture produced by fox and partially based on fechter version was released
o neill came to despise the role of $m_de_monte_cristo$ which he performed more than #time# feeling that his type casting had prevented him from pursuing more artistically rewarding roles
this discontent later became plot point in eugene neill semi autobiographical play long #day# journey into #night# the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ is musical based on the novel with influences from the film adaptation of the book
the music is written by frank wildhorn and the lyrics and book are by jack murphy it debuted in switzerland in
