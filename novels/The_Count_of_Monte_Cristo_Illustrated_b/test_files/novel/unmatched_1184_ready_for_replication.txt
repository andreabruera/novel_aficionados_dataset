on the th of february the #look# out at notre dame de la garde signalled the three #master# the $pharaon$ from smyrna trieste and naples
as usual a pilot put off immediately and rounding the château if got on #board# the #vessel# between cape morgiou and rion #island#
immediately and according to custom the ramparts of fort saint jean were covered with spectators it is always an #event# at marseilles for a ship to come into port especially when this ship like the $pharaon$ has been built rigged and laden at the old phocee docks and belongs to an owner of the city
the ship drew on and had safely passed the strait which some volcanic shock has made between the calasareigne and jaros #island# had doubled pomègue and approached the harbor under topsails jib and spanker but so slowly and sedately that the idlers with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil asked #one# another what #misfortune# could have happened on #board#
however those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred it was not to the #vessel# herself for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled the anchor a cockbill the jib boom guys already eased off and standing by the #side# of the pilot who was steering the $pharaon$ towards the narrow entrance of the inner port was a young #man# who with activity and vigilant #eye# watched every motion of the ship and repeated each direction of the pilot
the vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected #one# of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the #vessel# in harbor but jumping into a small skiff desired to be pulled alongside the $pharaon$ which he reached as she rounded into la réserve basin
when the young #man# on #board# saw this #person# approach he left his station by the pilot and hat in #hand# leaned over the ship
he was a fine tall slim young #fellow# of eighteen or twenty with black #eye# and #hair# as dark as a raven wing and his whole #appearance# bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to #man# accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger
#one# #chapter# marseilles the arrival bulwarks ah is it you $m_dantès$ cried the #man# in the skiff
what the #matter# and why have you such an #air# of sadness aboard a great #misfortune# $m_maximilian_morrel$ replied the young #man#
a great #misfortune# for me especially off civita vecchia we lost our brave #captain# $leclere$ and the cargo inquired the owner eagerly
is all safe $m_maximilian_morrel$ and i think you #will# be satisfied on that #head# but poor #captain# $leclere$
what happened to him asked the owner with an #air# of considerable resignation what happened to the worthy #captain#
he died fell into the #sea# no #sir# he died of brain fever in dreadful agony then turning to the crew he said
all #hand# obeyed and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the crew sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and outhaul topsail sheets and halyards the jib downhaul and the topsail clewlines and buntlines
the young #sailor# gave a #look# to see that his #order# were promptly and accurately obeyed and then turned again to the owner
bear a #hand# there to take in sail and how did this #misfortune# occur inquired the latter resuming the interrupted #conversation#
alas #sir# in the most unexpected #manner# after a long talk with the harbor #master# #captain# $leclere$ left naples greatly disturbed in #mind#
we performed the usual burial #service# and he is at his #rest# sewn up in his hammock with a thirty six pound shot at his #head# and his heels off el giglio #island#
in twenty four #hour# he was attacked by a fever and died three #day# afterwards we bring to his widow his sword and cross of #honor#
it was worth while truly added the young #man# with a melancholy #smile# to make war against the english for ten #year# and to die in his #bed# at last like everybody else
why you see $edmond_dantès$ replied the owner who appeared more comforted at every #moment# we are all mortal and the old must make #way# for the young
if not why there would be no promotion and since you assure me that the cargo is all safe and #sound# $m_maximilian_morrel$ take my #word# for it and i advise you not to take #franc# for the profits of the voyage
then as they were just passing the round tower the young #man# shouted stand by there to lower the topsails and jib brail up the spanker
the #order# was executed as promptly as it would have been on #board# a #man# of war let go and clue up
at this last command all the sails were lowered and the #vessel# moved almost imperceptibly onwards now if you #will# come on #board# $m_maximilian_morrel$ said $m_dantès$ observing the owner
impatience here is your supercargo $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ coming out of his cabin who #will# furnish you with every particular as for me i must #look# after the anchoring and dress the ship in mourning
he seized a rope which $m_dantès$ flung to him and with an activity that would have done credit to a #sailor# climbed up the #side# of the ship while the young #man# going to his task left the #conversation# to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who now came towards the owner
he was a #man# of twenty five or twenty six #year# of #age# of unprepossessing #countenance# obsequious to his superiors insolent to his subordinates and this in addition to his #position# as responsible agent on #board# which is always obnoxious to the #sailor# made him as much disliked by the crew as $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ was beloved by them
the owner did not wait for a second invitation well $m_maximilian_morrel$ said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ you have heard of the #misfortune# that has befallen us
and a first rate seaman #one# who had seen long and honorable #service# as became a #man# charged with the #interest# of a $house_of_peers$ so important as that of $m_maximilian_morrel$ #son# replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
yes yes poor #captain# $leclere$ he was a brave and an honest #man# but replied the owner glancing after $m_dantès$ who was watching the anchoring of his #vessel#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to understand his #business# for our #friend# $edmond_dantès$ seems to understand it thoroughly and not to require instruction from #anyone#
it seems to me that a #sailor# needs not be so old as you say yes said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ darting at $edmond_dantès$ a #look# gleaming with hate
breath out of his #body# when he assumed the command without consulting #anyone# and he caused us to lose a #day# and a #half# at the #island# of $elba$ instead of making for marseilles direct
as to taking command of the #vessel# replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ that was his #duty# as #captain# mate as to losing a #day# and a #half# off the #island# of $elba$ he was wrong unless the #vessel# needed repairs
the #vessel# was in as good condition as i am and as i #hope# you are $m_maximilian_morrel$ and this #day# and a #half# was lost from pure whim for the #pleasure# of going ashore and #nothing# else
yes he is young and youth is invariably self confident scarcely was the #captain# $m_dantès$ said the shipowner turning towards the young #man# come this #way#
in a #moment# #sir# answered $m_dantès$ and i with you then calling to the crew he said let go
$m_dantès$ continued at his post in #spite# of the #presence# of the pilot until this manœuvre was completed and then he added
the anchor was instantly dropped and the chain ran rattling through the port hole #half# mast the colors and square the yards
you see said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ he fancies himself #captain# already upon my #word# and so in #fact# he is said the owner
except your signature and your partner $m_maximilian_morrel$ and why should he not have this asked the owner
he is young it is true but he seems to me a thorough seaman and of full experience a cloud passed over $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #brow#
your pardon $m_maximilian_morrel$ said $m_dantès$ approaching the #vessel# now rides at anchor and i am at your #service# you hailed me i think
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ retreated a #step# or two i wished to inquire why you stopped at the #island# of $elba$
i do not know #sir# it was to fulfil the last instructions of #captain# $leclere$ who when dying gave me a packet for marshal bertrand
then did you see him $edmond_dantès$ who the marshal yes $m_maximilian_morrel$ looked around him and then #drawing# $m_dantès$ on #one# #side# he said suddenly
and how is the emperor very well as far as i could judge from the #sight# of him
you saw the emperor then he entered the marshal #apartment# while i was there and you spoke to him
why it was he who spoke to me #sir# said $m_dantès$ with a #smile# and what did he say to you
asked me #question# about the #vessel# the #time# she left marseilles the #course# she had taken and what was her cargo
i believe if she had not been laden and i had been her #master# he would have bought her but i told him i was only mate and that she belonged to the firm of $m_maximilian_morrel$ #son#
the morrels have been shipowners from #father# to #son# and there was a $m_maximilian_morrel$ who served in the same regiment with me when i was in garrison at valence
ah yes he said i know them $pardieu$ and that is true cried the owner greatly delighted
$m_dantès$ you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him and you #will# see it #will# bring #tear# into the old #soldier# #eye#
and that was policar $m_maximilian_morrel$ my uncle who was afterwards a #captain# come come continued he patting $edmond_dantès$ #shoulder# kindly
you did very #right# $m_dantès$ to follow #captain# $leclere$ instructions and touch at $elba$ although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal and had conversed with the emperor it might bring you into trouble
for i did not even know of what i was the bearer and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer
how could that bring me into trouble #sir# asked $m_dantès$ but pardon me here are the health #officer# and the customs #inspector# coming alongside
and the young #man# went to the gangway as he departed $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ approached and said well it appears that he has given you satisfactory #reason# for his landing at porto ferrajo
well so much the better said the supercargo for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his #duty#
yes most satisfactory my dear $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_dantès$ has done his replied the owner and that is not saying much
it was #captain# $leclere$ who gave #order# for this delay talking of #captain# $leclere$ has not $m_dantès$ given you a #letter# from him
to me no was there #one# i believe that besides the packet #captain# $leclere$ confided a #letter# to his #care#
of what packet are you speaking $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ why that which $m_dantès$ left at porto ferrajo how do you know he had a packet to leave at porto ferrajo
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ turned very red i was passing close to the #door# of the #captain# cabin which was #half# open and i saw him give the packet and #letter# to $m_dantès$
he did not speak to me of it replied the shipowner but if there be any #letter# he #will# give it to me
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ reflected for a #moment# then $m_maximilian_morrel$ i beg of you said he not to say a #word# to $m_dantès$ on the #subject#
i may have been mistaken at this #moment# the young #man# returned $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ withdrew well my dear $m_dantès$ are you now free inquired the owner
i gave the custom $house_of_peers$ #officer# a copy of our bill of lading and as to the #other# #paper# they sent a #man# off with the pilot to whom i gave them
yes #sir# you have not been long detained no then you have #nothing# more to do here
no #everything# is all #right# now then you can come and dine with me i really must ask you to excuse me $m_maximilian_morrel$
my first #visit# is due to my #father# though i am not the less grateful for the #honor# you have done me
#right# $m_dantès$ quite #right# i always knew you were a good #son# and inquired $m_dantès$ with some hesitation do you know how my #father# is
well i believe my dear $edmond_dantès$ though i have not seen him lately yes he likes to keep himself shut up in his little #room#
my #father# is proud #sir# and if he had not a meal left i #doubt# if he would have asked #anything# from #anyone# except from heaven
that proves at least that he has wanted for #nothing# during your absence $m_dantès$ smiled well then after this first #visit# has been made we shall #count# on you
i must again excuse myself $m_maximilian_morrel$ for after this first #visit# has been paid i have another which i am most anxious to pay
true $m_dantès$ i forgot that there was at the catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your #father# the lovely $mercédès$
i am not in the least surprised for she has been to me three #time# inquiring if there were any news of the $pharaon$
$m_dantès$ blushed ah ha said the shipowner peste $edmond_dantès$ you have a very handsome mistress
she is not my mistress replied the young #sailor# gravely she is my betrothed sometimes #one# and the same #thing# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ with a #smile#
not with us #sir# replied $m_dantès$ well well my dear $edmond_dantès$ continued the owner dont let me detain you
you have managed my #affair# so well that i ought to allow you all the #time# you require for your own
do you want any #money# no #sir# i have all my pay to take nearly three #month# wages you are a careful #fellow# $edmond_dantès$
say i have a poor #father# #sir# yes yes i know how good a #son# you are so now hasten away to see your #father#
i have a #son# too and i should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three #month# voyage
then i have your leave #sir# yes if you have #nothing# more to say to me
#nothing# #captain# $leclere$ did not before he died give you a #letter# for me he was unable to write #sir#
but that reminds me that i must ask your leave of absence for some #day# to get married
it #will# take quite six weeks to unload the cargo and we cannot get you ready for #sea# until three #month# after that only be back again in three #month# for the $pharaon$ added the owner patting the young #sailor# on the back cannot sail without her #captain#
yes first and then to go to paris very good have what #time# you require $m_dantès$
cried $m_dantès$ his #eye# sparkling with animation pray #mind# what you say for you are touching on the most #secret# #wish# of my #heart#
if i were sole owner we shake #hand# on it now my dear $m_dantès$ and call it settled but i have a partner and you know the italian proverb
without her #captain# is it really your intention to make me #captain# of the $pharaon$ chi ha compagno ha padrone he who has a partner
has a #master# but the #thing# is at least #half# done as you have #one# out of two votes rely on me to procure you the #other# i #will# do my best
ah $m_maximilian_morrel$ exclaimed the young seaman with #tear# in his #eye# and grasping the owner #hand# $m_maximilian_morrel$ i #thank# you in the #name# of my #father# and of $mercédès$
that all #right# $edmond_dantès$ there a providence that watches over the deserving go to your #father# go and see $mercédès$ and afterwards come to me
shall i row you ashore no #thank# you i shall remain and #look# over the #account# with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
have you been satisfied with him this voyage that is according to the sense you attach to the #question# #sir#
no for i think he never liked me since the #day# when i was silly enough after a little quarrel we had to propose to him to stop for ten #minute# at the #island# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ to settle the dispute
do you #mean# is he a good comrade a proposition which i was wrong to suggest and he quite #right# to refuse
if you #mean# as responsible agent when you ask me the #question# i believe there is #nothing# to say against him and that you #will# be content with the #way# in which he has performed his #duty#
but tell me $m_dantès$ if you had command of the $pharaon$ should you be glad to see $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ remain
#captain# or mate $m_maximilian_morrel$ i shall always have the greatest respect for those who possess the owners confidence
that #right# that #right# $m_dantès$ i see you are a thoroughly good #fellow# and #will# detain you no longer go for i see how impatient you are
then i have leave go i tell you may i have the #use# of your skiff
certainly then for the present $m_maximilian_morrel$ farewell and a thousand #thank# i #hope# soon to see you again my dear $edmond_dantès$
the young #sailor# jumped into the skiff and sat down in the stern sheets with the #order# that he be put ashore at la canebière
the two oarsmen bent to their #work# and the little #boat# glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of the thousand #vessel# which choke up the narrow #way# which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the quai orléans
the shipowner smiling followed him with his #eye# until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng which from five clock in the #morning# until nine clock at #night# swarms in the famous #street# of la canebière a #street# of which the modern phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the #world# and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said
good luck to you if paris had la canebière paris would be a second marseilles on turning round the owner saw $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ behind him apparently awaiting #order# but in reality also watching the young
#sailor# but there was a great difference in the #expression# of the two #man# who thus followed the movements of $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$
#father# and #son# we #will# leave $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ struggling with the demon of hatred and endeavoring to insinuate in the ear of the shipowner some evil suspicions against his comrade and follow $m_dantès$ who after having traversed la canebière took the rue de noailles and entering a small $house_of_peers$ on the left of the allées de meilhan rapidly ascended four flights of a dark #staircase# holding the baluster with #one# #hand# while with the #other# he repressed the beatings of his #heart# and paused before a #half# open #door# from which he could see the whole of a small #room#
the news of the arrival of the $pharaon$ had not yet reached the old #man# who mounted on a #chair# was amusing himself by training with trembling #hand# the nasturtiums and sprays of clematis that clambered over the trellis at his #window#
#chapter# this #room# was occupied by $m_dantès$ #father# suddenly he felt an #arm# thrown around his #body# and a well known #voice# behind him exclaimed
the old #man# uttered a #cry# and turned round then seeing his #son# he fell into his #arm# pale and trembling
#father# dear #father# what ails you my dearest #father# are you ill inquired the young #man# much alarmed no no my dear $edmond_dantès$
my #boy# my #son# no but i did not expect you and #joy# the surprise of seeing you so suddenly ah i feel as if i were going to die
come come cheer up my dear #father# tis i really i they say #joy# never hurts and so i came to you without any warning
come now do #smile# instead of looking at me so solemnly here i am back again and we are going to be happy
yes yes my #boy# so we #will# so we #will# replied the old #man# but how shall we be happy
shall you never leave me again come tell me all the good #fortune# that has befallen you god forgive me said the young #man# for rejoicing at #happiness# derived from the misery of #other# but
the good #captain# $leclere$ is dead #father# and it is probable that with the aid of $m_maximilian_morrel$ i shall have his #place#
heaven knows i did not seek this good #fortune# it has happened and i really cannot pretend to lament it do you understand #father#
only imagine me a #captain# at twenty with a hundred $louis_xviii$ pay and a share in the profits is this not more than a poor #sailor# like me could have hoped for
well then with the first #money# i touch i #mean# you to have a small $house_of_peers$ with a #garden# in which to plant clematis nasturtiums and honeysuckle
yes my dear #boy# replied the old #man# it is very fortunate but what ails you #father#
are you not well tis #nothing# nothing it #will# soon pass away and as he said so the old #man# #strength# failed him and he fell backwards
come come said the young #man# a #glass# of wine #father# #will# revive you where do you keep your wine
no no #thank# you need not #look# for it i do not want it said the old #man# yes yes #father# tell me where it is and he opened two or three cupboards
it is no #use# said the old #man# there is no wine what no wine said $m_dantès$ turning pale and looking alternately at the hollow cheeks of the old #man# and the empty cupboards
what no wine have you wanted #money# #father# i want #nothing# now that i have you said the old #man#
yet stammered $m_dantès$ wiping the perspiration from his #brow# yet i gave you two hundred #franc# when i left three #month# ago
yes yes $edmond_dantès$ that is true but you forgot at that #time# a little debt to our neighbor $m_caderousse$
he reminded me of it telling me if i did not pay for you he would be paid by $m_maximilian_morrel$ and so you see lest he might do you an
injury well why i paid him but cried $m_dantès$ it was a hundred and forty #franc# i owed $m_caderousse$
yes stammered the old #man# and you paid him out of the two hundred #franc# i left you
the old #man# nodded so that you have lived for three #month# on sixty #franc# muttered $edmond_dantès$ you know how little i require said the old #man#
heaven pardon me cried $edmond_dantès$ falling on his knees before his #father# what are you doing you have wounded me to the #heart#
never #mind# it for i see you once more said the old #man# and now it all over
#everything# is all #right# again yes here i am said the young #man# with a promising future and a little #money#
and he emptied his #pocket# on the #table# the contents consisting of a dozen #gold# #piece# five or six five #franc# #piece# and some smaller coin
here #father# here he said take this take it and send for #something# immediately the #countenance# of old $m_dantès$ brightened
whom does this belong to he inquired to me to you to us take it buy some provisions be happy and #tomorrow# we shall have more
gently gently said the old #man# with a #smile# and by your leave i #will# #use# your purse moderately for they would say if they saw me buy too many #thing# at a #time# that i had been obliged to await your #return# in #order# to be able to purchase them
do as you please but first of all pray have a #servant# #father# i #will# not have you left alone so long
i have some smuggled coffee and most capital tobacco in a small chest in the hold which you shall have #tomorrow#
but hush here comes somebody tis $m_caderousse$ who has heard of your arrival and no #doubt# comes to congratulate you on your fortunate #return#
ah #lip# that say #one# #thing# while the #heart# thinks another murmured $edmond_dantès$ but never #mind# he is a neighbor who has done us a #service# on a #time#
he was a #man# of twenty five or six and held a #piece# of cloth which being a tailor he was about to make into a coat lining
what is it you $edmond_dantès$ back again said he with a broad marseillaise accent and a grin that displayed his ivory white teeth
yes as you see neighbor $m_caderousse$ and ready to be agreeable to you in any and every #way# replied $m_dantès$ but ill concealing his coldness under this cloak of civility
so he welcome as $edmond_dantès$ paused the black and bearded #head# of $m_caderousse$ appeared at the #door#
#thank# but fortunately i do not want for #anything# and it #chance# that at #time# there are #other# who have need of me
#thank# $m_dantès$ made a gesture i do not allude to you my #boy# no no i lent you #money# and you returned it that like good neighbors and we are quits
we are never quits with those who oblige us was $m_dantès$ reply for when we do not owe them #money# we owe them gratitude
what the #use# of mentioning that what is done is done let us talk of your happy #return# my #boy#
i had gone on the quay to match a #piece# of mulberry cloth when i met #friend# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ you at marseilles yes says he
i #thought# you were at smyrna i was but am now back again and where is the dear #boy# our little $edmond_dantès$
and so i came added $m_caderousse$ as fast as i could to have the #pleasure# of shaking #hand# with a #friend#
why with his #father# no #doubt# replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ worthy $m_caderousse$ said the old #man# he is so much attached to us
but it seems you have come back rich my #boy# continued the tailor looking askance at the handful of #gold# and silver which $m_dantès$ had thrown on the #table#
yes to be sure i am i #love# and esteem you because honest folks are so rare the young #man# remarked the greedy #glance# which shone in the dark #eye# of his neighbor
i was expressing to my #father# my #fear# that he had wanted many #thing# in my absence and to convince me he emptied his purse on the #table#
come #father# added $m_dantès$ put this #money# back in your #box# unless neighbor $m_caderousse$ wants #anything# and in that #case# it is at his #service#
eh he said negligently this #money# is not mine no my #boy# no said $m_caderousse$ i am not in any want #thank# god my living is suited to my #mean#
keep your #money# keep it i say #one# never has too much but at the same #time# my #boy# i am as much obliged by your offer as if i took advantage of it
it was offered with good #will# said $m_dantès$ no #doubt# my #boy# no #doubt# well you stand well with $m_maximilian_morrel$
i hear you insinuating dog you $m_maximilian_morrel$ has always been exceedingly kind to me replied $m_dantès$ then you were wrong to refuse to dine with him
what did you refuse to dine with him said old $m_dantès$ and did he invite you to dine
yes my dear #father# replied $edmond_dantès$ smiling at his #father# #astonishment# at the excessive #honor# paid to his #son#
and why did you refuse my #son# inquired the old #man# that i might the sooner see you again my dear #father# replied the young #man#
i was most anxious to see you but it must have vexed $m_maximilian_morrel$ good worthy #man# said $m_caderousse$
and when you are looking forward to be #captain# it was wrong to annoy the owner but i explained to him the cause of my refusal replied $m_dantès$
and i #hope# he fully understood it yes but to be #captain# #one# must do a little flattery to #one# patrons
#nothing# #will# give greater #pleasure# to all your old #friend# and i know #one# down there behind the saint nicolas citadel who #will# not be sorry to hear it
i #hope# to be #captain# without that said $m_dantès$ so much the better so much the better $mercédès$
yes my dear #father# and with your permission now i have seen you and know you are well and have all you require i #will# ask your consent to go and pay a #visit# to the catalans
go my dear #boy# said old $m_dantès$ and heaven bless you in your #wife# as it has blessed me in my #son#
said the old #man# his #wife# said $m_caderousse$ why how fast you go on #father# $m_dantès$ she is not his #wife# yet as it seems to me
no but according to all probability she soon #will# be replied $edmond_dantès$ yes yes said $m_caderousse$
but you were #right# to #return# as soon as possible my #boy# and why because $mercédès$ is a very fine #girl# and fine #girl# never lack followers she particularly has them by dozens
ah yes continued $m_caderousse$ and capital offers too but you know you #will# be #captain# and who could refuse you then
meaning to say replied $m_dantès$ with a #smile# which but ill concealed his trouble that if i were not a #captain# eh eh said $m_caderousse$ shaking his #head#
really answered $edmond_dantès$ with a #smile# which had in it traces of slight uneasiness
i have a better #opinion# than you of #woman# in general and of $mercédès$ in particular and i am certain that #captain# or not she #will# remain ever faithful to me
when #one# is going to be married there is #nothing# like implicit confidence but never #mind# that my #boy# go and announce your arrival and let her know all your #hope# and prospects
come come said the #sailor# so much the better so much the better said $m_caderousse$ i #will# go directly was $edmond_dantès$ reply and embracing his #father# and nodding to $m_caderousse$ he left the #apartment#
$m_caderousse$ lingered for a #moment# then taking leave of old $m_dantès$ he went downstairs to rejoin $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who awaited him at the #corner# of the rue senac
well said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ did you see him i have just left him answered $m_caderousse$ did he allude to his #hope# of being #captain#
he spoke of it as a #thing# already decided indeed said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ he is in too much hurry it appears to me
why it seems $m_maximilian_morrel$ has promised him the #thing# so that he is quite elated about it
has already offered me his patronage as if he were a grand personage and proffered me a loan of #money# as though he were a #banker#
most assuredly although i might easily have accepted it for it was i who put into his #hand# the first silver he ever earned but now $m_dantès$ has no longer any occasion for assistance
why yes he is actually insolent over the #matter# which you refused he is about to become a #captain#
pooh said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ he is not #one# yet ma foi it #will# be as well if he is not answered $m_caderousse$
for if he should be there #will# be really no speaking to him if we choose replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ he #will# remain what he is and perhaps become even less than he is
what do you #mean# #nothing# i was speaking to myself and is he still in #love# with the catalane
over #head# and ears but unless i am much mistaken there #will# be a storm in that #quarter# m
explain yourself why should i it is more important than you think perhaps you do not like $m_dantès$
i know #nothing# for certain only i have seen #thing# which induce me to believe as i told you that the future #captain# #will# find some annoyance in the vicinity of the vieilles infirmeries
i never like upstarts then tell me all you know about the catalane
well every #time# i have seen $mercédès$ come into the city she has been accompanied by a tall strapping black eyed catalan with a red complexion brown skin and fierce #air# whom she calls cousin
what have you seen come tell me really and you think this cousin pays her #attention#
i only suppose so what else can a strapping chap of twenty #one# #mean# with a fine wench of seventeen and you say that $m_dantès$ has gone to the catalans
let us go the same #way# we #will# stop at la réserve and we can drink a #glass# of la malgue whilst we wait for news
he went before i came down come along said $m_caderousse$ but you pay the score
of #course# replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and going quickly to the designated #place# they called for a bottle of wine and two #glass#
père pamphile had seen $m_dantès$ pass not ten #minute# before and assured that he was at the catalans they sat down under the budding foliage of the planes and sycamores in the branches of which the birds were singing their welcome to #one# of the first #day# of spring
the catalans beyond a bare weather worn #wall# about a hundred paces from the #spot# where the two #friend# sat looking and listening as they drank their wine was the village of the catalans
long ago this mysterious colony quitted spain and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this #day#
#one# of its chiefs who understood provençal begged the commune of marseilles to give them this bare and barren promontory where like the #sailor# of old they had run their #boat# ashore
the request was granted and three #month# afterwards around the twelve or fifteen small #vessel# which had brought these gypsies of the #sea# a small village sprang up
this village constructed in a singular and picturesque #manner# #half# moorish #half# spanish still remains and is inhabited by descendants of the first comers who speak the language of their #father#
for three or four centuries they have remained upon this small promontory on which they had settled like a flight of seabirds without mixing with the marseillaise population intermarrying and preserving their original customs and the #costume# of their #mother# #country# as they have preserved its language
our readers #will# follow us along the only #street# of this little village and enter with us #one# of the #house# which is sunburned to the beautiful dead leaf color peculiar to the buildings of the #country# and within coated with whitewash like a spanish posada
a young and beautiful #girl# with #hair# as black as jet her #eye# as velvety as the gazelle was leaning with her back against the wainscot rubbing in her slender delicately moulded #finger# a bunch of heath blossoms the flowers of which she was picking off and strewing on the #floor# her #arm# bare to the elbow brown and modelled after those of the arlesian venus moved with a kind of restless impatience and she tapped the #earth# with her arched and supple #foot# so as to display the pure and full shape of her well turned leg in its red cotton gray and blue clocked stocking
at three paces from her seated in a #chair# which he balanced on two legs leaning his elbow on an old worm eaten #table# was a tall young #man# of twenty or two and twenty who was looking at her with an #air# in which vexation and uneasiness were mingled
#chapter# whence it came no #one# knew and it spoke an unknown tongue he questioned her with his #eye# but the firm and steady gaze of the young #girl# controlled his #look#
you see $mercédès$ said the young #man# here is easter come round again tell me is this the #moment# for a wedding
i have answered you a hundred #time# $m_fernand_mondego$ and really you must be very stupid to ask me again
well repeat it repeat it i beg of you that i may at last believe it tell me for the hundredth #time# that you refuse my #love# which had your #mother#
make me understand once for all that you are trifling with my #happiness# that my #life# or #death# are #nothing# to you
ah to have dreamed for ten #year# of being your #husband# $mercédès$ and to lose that #hope# which was the only stay of my existence
sanction at least it was not i who ever encouraged you in that #hope# $m_fernand_mondego$ replied $mercédès$ you cannot reproach me with the slightest coquetry
i #love# you as a #brother# but do not ask from me more than sisterly affection for my #heart# is another
i have always said to you is not this true $m_fernand_mondego$ yes that is very true $mercédès$ replied the young #man#
yes you have been cruelly frank with me but do you forget that it is among the catalans a sacred #law# to intermarry
you mistake $m_fernand_mondego$ it is not a #law# but merely a custom and i pray of you do not cite this custom in your favor
you are included in the conscription $m_fernand_mondego$ and are only at #liberty# on sufferance liable at any #moment# to be called upon to take up #arm#
once a #soldier# what would you do with me a poor orphan forlorn without #fortune# with #nothing# but a #half# ruined hut and a few ragged nets the miserable inheritance left by my #father# to my #mother# and by my #mother# to me
sometimes you pretend i am useful to you and that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing and i accept it $m_fernand_mondego$ because you are the #son# of my #father#
#brother# because we were brought up together and still more because it would give you so much pain if i refuse
but i feel very deeply that this fish which i go and sell and with the produce of which i buy the flax i spin i feel very keenly $m_fernand_mondego$ that this is charity
and if it were $mercédès$ poor and lone as you are you suit me as well as the #daughter# of the first shipowner or the richest #banker# of marseilles
what do such as we #desire# but a good #wife# and careful housekeeper and where can i #look# for these better than in you
she has been dead a #year# and you know $m_fernand_mondego$ i have subsisted almost entirely on public charity
$m_fernand_mondego$ answered $mercédès$ shaking her #head# a #woman# becomes a bad manager and who shall say she #will# remain an honest #woman# when she loves another #man# better than her #husband#
#rest# content with my friendship for i say once more that is all i can #promise# and i #will# #promise# no more than i can bestow
i understand replied $m_fernand_mondego$ you can endure your own wretchedness patiently but you are afraid to share mine well $mercédès$ beloved by you i would tempt #fortune# you would bring me good luck and i should become rich
i could extend my occupation as a fisherman might get a #place# as clerk in a warehouse and become in #time# a dealer myself
you could do no such #thing# $m_fernand_mondego$ you are a #soldier# and if you remain at the catalans it is because there is no war so remain a fisherman and contented with my friendship as i cannot give you more
i #will# be a #sailor# instead of the #costume# of our #father# which you despise i #will# wear a varnished hat a striped shirt and a blue jacket with an anchor on the buttons
well i #will# do better $mercédès$ would not that dress please you what do you #mean#
i #mean# $mercédès$ that you are thus harsh and cruel with me because you are expecting someone who is thus attired but perhaps he whom you await is inconstant or if he is not the #sea# is so to him
asked $mercédès$ with an angry #glance# what do you #mean# i do not understand you $m_fernand_mondego$ cried $mercédès$
i believed you were good hearted and i was mistaken $m_fernand_mondego$ you are wicked to call to your aid jealousy and the anger of god
if he does not #return# instead of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate i #will# tell you that he died loving me and me only
yes i #will# not deny it i do await and i do #love# him of whom you speak and the young #girl# made a gesture of rage
i understand you $m_fernand_mondego$ you would be revenged on him because i do not #love# you you would cross your catalan knife with his dirk
what #end# would that #answer# to lose you my friendship if he were conquered and see that friendship changed into hate if you were victor
believe me to seek a quarrel with a #man# is a bad method of pleasing the #woman# who loves that #man#
unable to have me for your #wife# you #will# content yourself with having me for your #friend# and sister and besides she added her #eye# troubled and moistened with #tear# wait wait $m_fernand_mondego$
you said just now that the #sea# was treacherous and he has been gone four #month# and during these four #month# there have been some terrible storms
$m_fernand_mondego$ made no reply nor did he attempt to check the #tear# which flowed down the cheeks of $mercédès$ although for each of these #tear# he would have shed his #heart# #blood# but these #tear# flowed for another
he arose paced a while up and down the hut and then suddenly stopping before $mercédès$ with his #eye# glowing and his #hand# clenched say $mercédès$ he said once for all is this your final determination
no $m_fernand_mondego$ you #will# not thus give #way# to evil #thought# i #love# $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ the young #girl# calmly replied and none but $edmond_dantès$ shall ever be my #husband#
$m_fernand_mondego$ let fall his #head# like a defeated #man# heaved a sigh that was like a groan and then suddenly looking her full in the #face# with clenched teeth and expanded nostrils
and you #will# always #love# him as long as i live said but if he is dead
if he is dead i shall die too if he has forgotten you $mercédès$ called a joyous #voice# from without $mercédès$
ah exclaimed the young #girl# blushing with delight and fairly leaping in excess of #love# you see he has not forgotten me for here he is
$m_fernand_mondego$ pale and trembling drew back like a #traveller# at the #sight# of a serpent and fell into a #chair# beside him
and rushing towards the #door# she opened it saying here $edmond_dantès$ here i am $edmond_dantès$ and $mercédès$ were clasped in each #other# #arm#
the burning marseilles sun which shot into the #room# through the open #door# covered them with a flood of #light# at first they saw #nothing# around them
their intense #happiness# isolated them from all the #rest# of the #world# and they only spoke in broken #word# which are the tokens of a #joy# so extreme that they seem rather the #expression# of sorrow
by a movement for which he could scarcely #account# to himself the young catalan placed his #hand# on the knife at his belt
suddenly $edmond_dantès$ saw the gloomy pale and threatening #countenance# of $m_fernand_mondego$ as it was defined in the #shadow# ah your pardon said $m_dantès$ frowning in his #turn#
i did not perceive that there were three of us then turning to $mercédès$ he inquired who is this #gentleman#
#one# who #will# be your best #friend# $m_dantès$ for he is my #friend# my cousin my #brother# it is $m_fernand_mondego$ the #man# whom after you $edmond_dantès$ i #love# the best in the #world#
said $m_dantès$ and without relinquishing $mercédès$ #hand# clasped in #one# of his own he extended the #other# to the catalan with a cordial #air#
do you not remember him yes but $m_fernand_mondego$ instead of responding to this amiable gesture remained mute and trembling
$edmond_dantès$ then cast his #eye# scrutinizingly at the agitated and embarrassed $mercédès$ and then again on the gloomy and menacing $m_fernand_mondego$
this #look# told him all and his anger waxed hot i did not know when i came with such haste to you that i was to meet an #enemy# here
an #enemy# cried $mercédès$ with an angry #look# at her cousin an #enemy# in my $house_of_peers$ do you say $edmond_dantès$
if i believed that i would #place# my #arm# under yours and go with you to marseilles leaving the $house_of_peers$ to #return# to it no more
and should any #misfortune# occur to you dear $edmond_dantès$ she continued with the same calmness which proved to $m_fernand_mondego$ that the young #girl# had read the very innermost depths of his sinister #thought# if #misfortune# should occur to you i would ascend the highest #point# of the cape de morgiou and cast myself headlong from it
$m_fernand_mondego$ #eye# darted lightning $m_fernand_mondego$ became deadly pale but you are deceived $edmond_dantès$ she continued you have no #enemy# here
and at these #word# the young #girl# fixed her imperious #look# on the catalan who as if fascinated by it came slowly towards $edmond_dantès$ and offered him his #hand#
there is no #one# but $m_fernand_mondego$ my #brother# who #will# grasp your #hand# as a devoted #friend# his hatred like a powerless though furious wave was broken against the strong ascendancy which $mercédès$ exercised over him
scarcely however had he touched $edmond_dantès$ #hand# when he felt he had done all he could do and rushed hastily out of the $house_of_peers$
oh he exclaimed running furiously and tearing his #hair# oh who #will# deliver me from this #man# wretched wretched that i am
hallo catalan hallo $m_fernand_mondego$ where are you running to exclaimed a #voice# the young #man# stopped suddenly looked around him and perceived $m_caderousse$ sitting at #table# with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ under an arbor
are you really in such a hurry that you have no #time# to pass the #time# of #day# with your #friend#
well said $m_caderousse$ why dont you come particularly when they have still a full bottle before them added $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
$m_fernand_mondego$ looked at them both with a stupefied #air# but did not say a #word# he seems besotted said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ pushing $m_caderousse$ with his knee
are we mistaken and is $m_dantès$ triumphant in #spite# of all we have believed why we must inquire into that was $m_caderousse$ reply and turning towards the young #man# said
$m_fernand_mondego$ wiped away the perspiration steaming from his #brow# and slowly entered the arbor whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to his senses and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted #body#
well catalan cant you make up your #mind# good #day# said he you called me didnt you and he fell rather than sat down on #one# of the #seat# which surrounded the #table#
i called you because you were running like a madman and i was afraid you would throw yourself into the #sea# said $m_caderousse$ laughing
why when a #man# has #friend# they are not only to offer him a #glass# of wine but moreover to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of #water# unnecessarily
$m_fernand_mondego$ gave a groan which resembled a sob and dropped his #head# into his #hand# his elbows leaning on the #table#
well $m_fernand_mondego$ i must say said $m_caderousse$ beginning the #conversation# with that brutality of the common #people# in which curiosity destroys all diplomacy
you #look# uncommonly like a rejected lover and he burst into a hoarse laugh bah said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
a lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in #love# you are laughing at him $m_caderousse$
no he replied only hark how he sighs come come $m_fernand_mondego$ said $m_caderousse$ hold up your #head# and #answer# us
it not polite not to reply to #friend# who ask news of your health my health is well enough said $m_fernand_mondego$ clenching his #hand# without raising his #head#
this is how it is $m_fernand_mondego$ whom you see here is a good and brave catalan #one# of the best fishermen in marseilles and he is in #love# with a very fine #girl# named $mercédès$ but it appears unfortunately that the fine #girl# is in #love# with the mate of the $pharaon$ and as the $pharaon$ arrived #today#
ah you see $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said $m_caderousse$ winking at his #friend# why you understand no i do not understand said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
well and what then said $m_fernand_mondego$ lifting up his #head# and looking at $m_caderousse$ like a #man# who #look# for someone on whom to vent his anger
poor $m_fernand_mondego$ has been dismissed continued $m_caderousse$ $mercédès$ is not accountable to any #person# is she is she not free to #love# whomsoever she #will#
but i #thought# you were a catalan and they told me the catalans were not #man# to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival
oh if you take it in that sense said $m_caderousse$ it is another #thing# it was even told me that $m_fernand_mondego$ especially was terrible in his vengeance
$m_fernand_mondego$ smiled piteously a lover is never terrible he said poor #fellow# remarked $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ affecting to #pity# the young #man# from the bottom of his #heart#
why you see he did not expect to see $m_dantès$ #return# so suddenly he #thought# he was dead perhaps or perchance faithless
these #thing# always come on us more severely when they come suddenly ah ma foi under any #circumstance#
said $m_caderousse$ who drank as he spoke and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take #effect# under any #circumstance# $m_fernand_mondego$ is not the only #person# put out by the fortunate arrival of $m_dantès$ is he $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
answered $m_caderousse$ pouring out a #glass# of wine for $m_fernand_mondego$ and filling his own for the eighth or ninth #time# while $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had merely sipped his
no you are #right# and i should say that would bring him ill luck well never #mind#
during this #time# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ fixed his piercing #glance# on the young #man# on whose #heart# $m_caderousse$ #word# fell like molten lead
never #mind# in the meantime he marries $mercédès$ the lovely $mercédès$ at least he #return# to do that and when is the wedding to be he asked
oh it is not yet fixed murmured $m_fernand_mondego$ no but it #will# be said $m_caderousse$ as surely as $m_dantès$ #will# be #captain# of the $pharaon$ eh $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ shuddered at this unexpected attack and turned to $m_caderousse$ whose #countenance# he scrutinized to try and detect whether the blow was premeditated but he read #nothing# but envy in a #countenance# already rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness
well said he filling the #glass# let us drink to #captain# $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ #husband# of the beautiful catalane
$m_caderousse$ raised his #glass# to his mouth with unsteady #hand# and swallowed the contents at a gulp $m_fernand_mondego$ dashed his on the #ground#
eh eh eh stammered $m_caderousse$ what do i see down there by the #wall# in the direction of the catalans
you know wine is a deceiver but i should say it was two lovers walking #side# by #side# and #hand# in #hand#
#look# $m_fernand_mondego$ your #eye# are better than mine i believe i see double heaven forgive me they do not know that we can see them and they are actually embracing
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ did not lose #one# pang that $m_fernand_mondego$ endured do you know them $m_fernand_mondego$ he said yes was the reply in a low #voice#
it is $edmond_dantès$ and $mercédès$ ah see there now said $m_caderousse$ and i did not recognize them hallo $m_dantès$
come this #way# and let us know when the wedding is to be for $m_fernand_mondego$ here is so obstinate he #will# not tell us
hold your tongue #will# you said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ pretending to restrain $m_caderousse$ who with the tenacity of drunkards leaned out of the arbor
hello lovely damsel try to stand upright and let the lovers make #love# without interruption see #look# at $m_fernand_mondego$ and follow his example he is well behaved m
$m_fernand_mondego$ probably excited beyond bearing pricked by $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ as the bull is by the bandilleros was about to rush out for he had risen from his #seat# and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival when $mercédès$ smiling and graceful lifted up her lovely #head# and looked at them with her clear and bright #eye#
at this $m_fernand_mondego$ recollected her threat of dying if $edmond_dantès$ died and dropped again heavily on his #seat# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ looked at the two #man# #one# after the #other# the #one# brutalized by liquor the #other# overwhelmed with #love#
i shall get #nothing# from these fools he muttered and i am very much afraid of being here between a drunkard and a coward
here an envious #fellow# making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing his wrath and here is a fool who sees the #woman# he loves stolen from under his nose and takes on like a big baby
yet this catalan has #eye# that glisten like those of the vengeful spaniards sicilians and calabrians and the #other# has fists big enough to crush an ox at #one# blow
unquestionably $edmond_dantès$ star is in the ascendant and he #will# marry the splendid #girl# he #will# be #captain# too and laugh at us all unless a sinister #smile# passed over $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
#lip# unless i take a #hand# in the #affair# he added hallo continued $m_caderousse$ #half# rising and with his fist on the #table# hallo $edmond_dantès$
do you not see your #friend# or are you too proud to speak to them no my dear #fellow# replied $m_dantès$
i am not proud but i am happy and #happiness# blinds i think more than pride ah very well that an explanation said $m_caderousse$
$mercédès$ courtesied gravely and said that is not my #name# and in my #country# it bodes ill #fortune# they say to call a young #girl# by the #name# of her betrothed before he becomes her #husband#
how do you do #madame# $m_dantès$ so call me $mercédès$ if you please we must excuse our worthy neighbor $m_caderousse$ said $m_dantès$ he is so easily mistaken
so then the wedding is to take #place# immediately $m_dantès$ said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ bowing to the young couple
as soon as possible $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #today# all preliminaries #will# be arranged at my #father# and #tomorrow# or next #day# at latest the wedding festival here at la réserve
my #friend# #will# be there i #hope# that is to say you are invited $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and you $m_caderousse$
and $m_fernand_mondego$ said $m_caderousse$ with a chuckle $m_fernand_mondego$ too is invited my #wife# #brother# is my #brother# said $edmond_dantès$
$m_fernand_mondego$ opened his mouth to reply but his #voice# died on his #lip# and he could not utter a #word#
and we $mercédès$ and i should be very sorry if he were absent at such a #time# #today# the preliminaries #tomorrow# or next #day# the ceremony
you are in a hurry #captain# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said $edmond_dantès$ smiling i #will# say to you as $mercédès$ said just now to $m_caderousse$
do not give me a title which does not belong to me that may bring me bad luck
i merely said you seemed in a hurry and we have lots of #time# the $pharaon$ cannot be under weigh again in less than three #month#
we are always in a hurry to be happy $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ for when we have suffered a long #time# we have great difficulty in believing in good #fortune#
your pardon replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ but it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste i must go to paris
ah really to paris and #will# it be the first #time# you have ever been there $m_dantès$ yes
have you #business# there not of my own the last commission of poor #captain# $leclere$ you know to what i allude $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
it is sacred besides i shall only take the #time# to go and #return# yes yes i understand said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and then in a low #tone# he added
to paris no #doubt# to deliver the #letter# which the grand marshal gave him ah this #letter# gives me an #idea# a capital #idea#
ah $m_dantès$ my #friend# you are not yet registered number #one# on #board# the good ship $pharaon$ then turning towards $edmond_dantès$ who was walking away a pleasant journey he cried
#thank# you said $edmond_dantès$ with a friendly nod and the two lovers continued on their #way# as calm and joyous as if they were the very elect of heaven
conspiracy $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ followed $edmond_dantès$ and $mercédès$ with his #eye# until the two lovers disappeared behind #one# of the angles of fort saint nicolas then turning round he perceived $m_fernand_mondego$ who had fallen pale and trembling into his #chair# while $m_caderousse$ stammered out the #word# of a drinking song
#chapter# well my dear #sir# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to $m_fernand_mondego$ here is a #marriage# which does not appear to make everybody happy
it drives me to #despair# said $m_fernand_mondego$ do you then #love# $mercédès$ i adore her
and you sit there tearing your #hair# instead of seeking to remedy your condition i did not think that was the #way# of your #people#
for long as long as i have known her always what would you have me do said $m_fernand_mondego$
i am not in #love# with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mercédès$ but for you in the #word# of the gospel seek and you shall find
i would stab the #man# but the #woman# told me that if any #misfortune# happened to her betrothed she would kill herself
how do i know is it my #affair# i have found already what pooh
#woman# say those #thing# but never do them you do not know $mercédès$ what she threatens she #will# do
idiot muttered $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ whether she kill herself or not what #matter# provided $m_dantès$ is not #captain# before $mercédès$ should die replied $m_fernand_mondego$ with the accents of unshaken resolution
i would die myself that what i call #love# said $m_caderousse$ with a #voice# more tipsy than ever
come said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ you appear to me a good #sort# of #fellow# and hang me i should like to help you but
that #love# or i dont know what #love# is yes said $m_caderousse$ but how my dear #fellow# replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
you are three #part# drunk finish the bottle and you #will# be completely so drink then and do not meddle with what we are discussing for that requires all #one# wit and cool judgment
i drunk said $m_caderousse$ well that a good #one# i could drink four more such bottles they are no bigger than cologne flasks
père pamphile more wine and $m_caderousse$ rattled his #glass# upon the #table# you were saying #sir# said $m_fernand_mondego$ awaiting with great anxiety the #end# of this interrupted remark
what was i saying i forget this drunken $m_caderousse$ has made me lose the thread of my sentence
drunk if you like so much the worse for those who #fear# wine for it is because they have bad #thought# which they are afraid the liquor #will# extract from their #heart# and $m_caderousse$ began to sing the two last #line# of a song very popular at the #time#
tous les méchants sont buveurs eau est bien prouvé par le déluge you said #sir# you would like to help me but
yes but i added to help you it would be sufficient that $m_dantès$ did not marry her you #love# and the #marriage# may easily be thwarted methinks and yet $m_dantès$ need not die
#death# alone can separate them remarked $m_fernand_mondego$ you talk like a noodle my #friend# said $m_caderousse$ and here is $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who is a wide awake clever deep #fellow# who #will# prove to you that you are wrong
prove it $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i have answered for you say there is no need why $m_dantès$ should die it would indeed be a #pity# he should
$m_dantès$ is a good #fellow# i like $m_dantès$ dantès your health $m_fernand_mondego$ rose impatiently let him run on said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ restraining the young #man#
absence severs as well as #death# and if the #wall# of a #prison# were between $edmond_dantès$ and $mercédès$ they would be as effectually separated as if he lay under a tombstone
yes but #one# gets out of #prison# said $m_caderousse$ who with what sense was left him listened eagerly to the #conversation# and when #one# gets out and #one# #name# is $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ #one# seeks revenge
drunk as he is he is not much out in what he says what #matter# that muttered $m_fernand_mondego$
and why i should like to know persisted $m_caderousse$ should they put $m_dantès$ in #prison# he has neither robbed nor killed nor murdered
i say i want to know why they should put $m_dantès$ in #prison# i like $m_dantès$ dantès your health and he swallowed another #glass# of wine
hold your tongue said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i wont hold my tongue replied $m_caderousse$ $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ saw in the muddled #look# of the tailor the progress of his intoxication and turning towards $m_fernand_mondego$ said
well you understand there is no need to kill him certainly not if as you said just now you have the #mean# of having $m_dantès$ arrested
have you that #mean# it is to be found for the searching but why should i meddle in the #matter#
but this i know you have some motive of personal hatred against $m_dantès$ for he who himself hates is never mistaken in the sentiments of #other#
it is no #affair# of mine i know not why you meddle said $m_fernand_mondego$ seizing his #arm#
i saw you were unhappy and your unhappiness interested me that all but since you believe i act for my own #account# adieu my dear #friend# get out of the #affair# as best you may and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ rose as if he meant to depart
it is of very little consequence to me at the #end# of the #matter# whether you have any angry #feeling# or not against $m_dantès$
i motives of hatred against $m_dantès$ none on my #word# no no said $m_fernand_mondego$ restraining him stay i hate him
do you find the #mean# i #will# execute it provided it is not to kill the #man# for $mercédès$ has declared she #will# kill herself if $m_dantès$ is killed
$m_caderousse$ who had let his #head# drop on the #table# now raised it and looking at $m_fernand_mondego$ with his dull and fishy #eye# he said
i confess it openly kill $m_dantès$ who talks of killing $m_dantès$ i wont have him killed i wont he my #friend# and this #morning# offered to share his #money# with me as i shared mine with him
i wont have $m_dantès$ killed i wont and who has said a #word# about killing him muddlehead replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
we were merely joking drink to his health he added filling $m_caderousse$ #glass# and do not interfere with us
yes yes $m_dantès$ good health said $m_caderousse$ emptying his #glass# here to his health his health hurrah but the #mean# the #mean# said $m_fernand_mondego$
have you not hit upon any asked $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ no you undertook to do so true replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ the french have the superiority over the spaniards that the spaniards ruminate while the french invent
do you invent then said $m_fernand_mondego$ impatiently waiter said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ pen ink and #paper# pen ink and #paper# muttered $m_fernand_mondego$
yes i am a supercargo pen ink and #paper# are my tools and without my tools i am fit for #nothing#
pen ink and #paper# then called $m_fernand_mondego$ loudly there what you want on that #table# said the waiter
when #one# thinks said $m_caderousse$ letting his #hand# drop on the #paper# there is here wherewithal to kill a #man# more sure than if we waited at the #corner# of a wood to assassinate him
i have always had more dread of a pen a bottle of ink and a sheet of #paper# than of a sword or #pistol#
bring them here the waiter did as he was desired the #fellow# is not so drunk as he appears to be said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
$m_fernand_mondego$ filled $m_caderousse$ #glass# who like the confirmed toper he was lifted his #hand# from the #paper# and seized the #glass#
the catalan watched him until $m_caderousse$ almost overcome by this fresh assault on his senses rested or rather dropped his #glass# upon the #table#
give him some more wine $m_fernand_mondego$ well resumed the catalan as he saw the final glimmer of $m_caderousse$ #reason# vanishing before the last #glass# of wine
well then i should say for instance resumed $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ that if after a voyage such as $m_dantès$ has just made in which he touched at the #island# of $elba$ someone were to denounce him to the #king# #procureur# as a bonapartist agent
yes but they #will# make you then #sign# your declaration and confront you with him you have denounced i #will# supply you with the #mean# of supporting your accusation for i know the #fact# well
but $m_dantès$ cannot remain forever in #prison# and #one# #day# or #other# he #will# leave it and the #day# when he comes out woe betide him who was the cause of his incarceration
i #will# denounce him exclaimed the young #man# hastily oh i should #wish# #nothing# better than that he would come and seek a quarrel with me
yes and $mercédès$ mercédès who #will# detest you if you have only the #misfortune# to scratch the skin of her dearly beloved $edmond_dantès$
no no continued $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ if we resolve on such a #step# it would be much better to take as i now do this pen dip it into this ink and write with the left #hand# that the writing may not be recognized the denunciation we propose
and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ uniting practice with theory wrote with his left #hand# and in a writing reversed from his usual style and totally unlike it the following #line# which he handed to $m_fernand_mondego$ and which $m_fernand_mondego$ read in an undertone
the honorable the #king# attorney is informed by a #friend# of the throne and religion that #one# $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ mate of the ship $pharaon$ arrived this #morning# from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been intrusted by murat with a #letter# for the usurper and by the usurper with a #letter# for the bonapartist committee in paris
#proof# of this #crime# #will# be found on arresting him for the #letter# #will# be found upon him or at his #father# or in his cabin on #board# the $pharaon$
very good resumed $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ now your revenge #look# like common sense for in no #way# can it revert to yourself and the #matter# #will# thus #work# its own #way# there is #nothing# to do now but fold the #letter# as i am doing and write upon it
true said $m_fernand_mondego$ to the #king# attorney and that all settled and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ wrote the address as he spoke
exclaimed $m_caderousse$ who by a last #effort# of intellect had followed the reading of the #letter# and instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must entail
yes and that all settled only it #will# be an infamous shame and he stretched out his #hand# to reach the #letter#
and as what i say and do is merely in jest and i amongst the first and foremost should be sorry if #anything# happened to $m_dantès$ the worthy $m_dantès$ #look# here
yes and that all settled yes said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ taking it from beyond his reach and taking the #letter# he squeezed it up in his #hand# and threw it into a #corner# of the arbor
all #right# said $m_caderousse$ $m_dantès$ is my #friend# and i wont have him ill used and who thinks of using him ill
certainly neither i nor $m_fernand_mondego$ said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ rising and looking at the young #man# who still remained seated but whose #eye# was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of #paper# flung into the #corner#
in this #case# replied $m_caderousse$ let have some more wine i #wish# to drink to the health of $edmond_dantès$ and the lovely $mercédès$
you have had too much already drunkard said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and if you continue you #will# be compelled to sleep here because unable to stand on your legs
i said $m_caderousse$ rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken #man# i cant keep on my legs
why i ll wager i can go up into the belfry of the accoules and without staggering too done said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
i ll take your bet but #tomorrow# #today# it is #time# to #return# give me your #arm# and let us go
very well let us go said $m_caderousse$ but i dont want your #arm# at all come $m_fernand_mondego$ wont you #return# to marseilles with us
no said $m_fernand_mondego$ i shall #return# to the catalans you re wrong come with us to marseilles come along
i #will# not what do you #mean# you #will# not well just as you like my prince there #liberty# for all the #world#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ took advantage of $m_caderousse$ temper at the #moment# to take him off towards marseilles by the porte saint victor staggering as he went
when they had advanced about twenty yards $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ looked back and saw $m_fernand_mondego$ stoop pick up the crumpled #paper# and putting it into his #pocket# then rush out of the arbor towards pillon
come along $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and let the young #gentleman# #return# to the catalans if he chooses well said $m_caderousse$ why what a lie he told
he said he was going to the catalans and he is going to the city hallo $m_fernand_mondego$ you are coming my #boy#
oh you dont see straight said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ he gone #right# by the #road# to the vieilles infirmeries
well said $m_caderousse$ i should have sworn that he turned to the #right# how treacherous wine is come come said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to himself now the #thing# is at #work# and it #will# #effect# its #purpose# unassisted
#chapter# the #marriage# feast the #morning# sun rose clear and resplendent touching the foamy waves into a network of ruby tinted #light#
the feast had been made ready on the second #floor# at la réserve with whose arbor the reader is already familiar
the #apartment# destined for the #purpose# was spacious and lighted by a number of #window# over each of which was written in golden #letter# for some inexplicable #reason# the #name# of #one# of the principal cities of france beneath these #window# a wooden balcony extended the entire #length# of the $house_of_peers$
and although the entertainment was fixed for twelve clock an #hour# previous to that #time# the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant #guest# consisting of the favored #part# of the crew of the $pharaon$ and #other# personal #friend# of the bridegroom the whole of whom had arrayed themselves in their choicest #costume# in #order# to do greater #honor# to the occasion
various rumors were afloat to the #effect# that the owners of the $pharaon$ had promised to attend the nuptial feast but all seemed unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could possibly be intended
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ however who now made his #appearance# accompanied by $m_caderousse$ effectually confirmed the report stating that he had recently conversed with $m_maximilian_morrel$ who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at la réserve
in #fact# a #moment# later $m_maximilian_morrel$ appeared and was saluted with an enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the $pharaon$ who hailed the #visit# of the shipowner as a sure indication that the #man# whose wedding feast he thus delighted to #honor# would ere long be first in command of the ship and as $m_dantès$ was universally beloved on #board# his #vessel# the #sailor# put no restraint on their tumultuous #joy# at finding that the #opinion# and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with their own
with the entrance of $m_maximilian_morrel$ $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and $m_caderousse$ were despatched in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively sensation and to beseech him to make haste
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and $m_caderousse$ set off upon their errand at full speed but ere they had gone many #step# they perceived a group advancing towards them composed of the betrothed pair a party of young #girl# in attendance on the bride by whose #side# walked $m_dantès$ #father# the whole brought up by $m_fernand_mondego$ whose #lip# wore their usual sinister #smile#
neither $mercédès$ nor $edmond_dantès$ observed the strange #expression# of his #countenance# they were so happy that they were conscious only of the sunshine and the #presence# of each #other#
having acquitted themselves of their errand and exchanged a hearty shake of the #hand# with $edmond_dantès$ $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and $m_caderousse$ took their #place# beside $m_fernand_mondego$ and old $m_dantès$ the latter of whom attracted universal notice
his thin but wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings evidently of english manufacture while from his three cornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons
thus he came along supporting himself on a curiously carved stick his aged #countenance# lit up with #happiness# looking for all the #world# like #one# of the aged dandies of parading the newly opened #garden# of the luxembourg and tuileries
beside him glided $m_caderousse$ whose #desire# to partake of the good #thing# provided for the wedding party had induced him to become reconciled to the $m_dantès$ #father# and #son# although there still lingered in his #mind# a faint and unperfect recollection of the #event# of the preceding #night# just as the brain retains on waking in the #morning# the dim and misty outline of a #dream# m
as $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ approached the disappointed lover he cast on him a #look# of deep meaning while $m_fernand_mondego$ as he slowly paced behind the happy pair who seemed in their own unmixed content to have entirely forgotten that such a being as himself existed was pale and abstracted occasionally however a deep flush would overspread his #countenance# and a nervous contraction distort his #feature# while with an agitated and restless gaze he would #glance# in the direction of marseilles like #one# who either anticipated or foresaw some great and important #event#
$m_dantès$ himself was simply but becomingly clad in the dress peculiar to the merchant #service# a #costume# somewhat between a military and a civil garb and with his fine #countenance# radiant with #joy# and #happiness# a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined
lovely as the greek #girl# of cyprus or chios $mercédès$ boasted the same bright flashing #eye# of jet and ripe round coral #lip#
the old #man# was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk trimmed with steel buttons beautifully cut and polished she moved with the #light# free #step# of an arlesienne or an andalusian
#one# more practiced in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil or at least have cast down her thickly fringed lashes so as to have concealed the liquid lustre of her animated #eye# but on the #contrary# the delighted #girl# looked around her with a #smile# that seemed to say if you are my #friend# rejoice with me for i am very happy
as soon as the bridal party came in #sight# of la réserve $m_maximilian_morrel$ descended and came forth to meet it followed by the #soldier# and #sailor# there assembled to whom he had repeated the #promise# already given that $m_dantès$ should be the successor to the late #captain# $leclere$
$edmond_dantès$ at the approach of his patron respectfully placed the #arm# of his affianced bride within that of $m_maximilian_morrel$ who forthwith conducting her up the flight of wooden #step# leading to the #chamber# in which the feast was prepared was gayly followed by the #guest# beneath whose heavy tread the slight structure creaked and groaned for the space of several #minute#
#father# said $mercédès$ stopping when she had reached the centre of the #table# sit i pray you on my #right# #hand# on my left i #will# #place# him who has ever been as a #brother# to me pointing with a soft and gentle #smile# to $m_fernand_mondego$ but her #word# and #look# seemed to inflict the direst torture on him for his #lip# became ghastly pale and even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the #blood# might be seen retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the #heart#
during this #time# $m_dantès$ at the opposite #side# of the #table# had been occupied in similarly placing his most honored #guest#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ was seated at his #right# #hand# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ at his left while at a #sign# from $edmond_dantès$ the #rest# of the company ranged themselves as they found it most agreeable
then they began to pass around the dusky piquant arlesian sausages and lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses prawns of large size and brilliant color the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel within the clovis esteemed by the epicures of the south as more than rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster north
all the delicacies in #fact# that are cast up by the wash of #water# on the sandy beach and styled by the grateful fishermen fruits of the #sea#
a pretty #silence# truly said the old #father# of the bridegroom as he carried to his #lip# a #glass# of wine of the hue and brightness of the topaz and which had just been placed before $mercédès$ herself
now would anybody think that this #room# contained a happy merry party who #desire# #nothing# better than to laugh and dance the #hour# away
ah sighed $m_caderousse$ a #man# cannot always feel happy because he is about to be married
the #truth# is replied $m_dantès$ that i am too happy for noisy mirth if that is what you meant by your observation my worthy #friend# you are #right# #joy# takes a strange #effect# at #time# it seems to oppress us almost the same as sorrow
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ looked towards $m_fernand_mondego$ whose excitable #nature# received and betrayed each fresh impression why what ails you
asked he of $edmond_dantès$ do you #fear# any approaching evil i should say that you were the happiest #man# alive at this #instant#
#man# does not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed #happiness# is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood where fierce fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach and monsters of all shapes and kinds requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours
i own that i am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an #honor# of which i feel myself unworthy
and that is the very #thing# that alarms me returned $m_dantès$ that of being the #husband# of $mercédès$
nay nay cried $m_caderousse$ smiling you have not attained that #honor# yet $mercédès$ is not yet your #wife#
just assume the #tone# and #manner# of a #husband# and see how she #will# remind you that your #hour# is not yet come
the bride blushed while $m_fernand_mondego$ restless and uneasy seemed to start at every fresh #sound# and from #time# to #time# wiped away the large drops of perspiration that gathered on his #brow#
well never #mind# that neighbor $m_caderousse$ it is not worthwhile to contradict me for such a trifle as that
tis true that $mercédès$ is not actually my #wife# but added he #drawing# out his watch in an #hour# and a #half# she #will# be
a general exclamation of surprise ran round the #table# with the exception of the elder $m_dantès$ whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his large white teeth
$mercédès$ looked pleased and gratified while $m_fernand_mondego$ grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch in an #hour# inquired $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ turning pale
#thank# to the influence of $m_maximilian_morrel$ to whom next to my #father# i owe every blessing i enjoy every difficulty has been removed
we have purchased permission to waive the usual delay and at #half# past two clock the mayor of marseilles #will# be waiting for us at the city hall
now as a #quarter# past #one# has already struck i do not consider i have asserted too much in saying that in another #hour# and thirty #minute# $mercédès$ #will# have become #madame# $m_dantès$
m $m_fernand_mondego$ closed his #eye# a burning sensation passed across his #brow# and he was compelled to support himself by the #table# to prevent his falling from his #chair# but in #spite# of all his #effort# he could not refrain from uttering a deep groan which however was lost amid the noisy felicitations of the company
how is that my #friend# why thus it is replied $m_dantès$ upon my #word# cried the old #man# you make short #work# of this kind of #affair#
arrived here only #yesterday# #morning# and married #today# at three clock commend me to a #sailor# for going the quick #way# to #work#
but asked $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ in a timid #tone# how did you manage about the #other# formalities the contract the settlement
the contract answered $m_dantès$ laughingly it didnt take long to fix that $mercédès$ has no #fortune# i have none to settle on her
so you see our #paper# were quickly written out and certainly do not come very expensive this joke elicited a fresh burst of applause
so that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast #turn# out to be the actual wedding #dinner# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
#tomorrow# #morning# i start for paris four #day# to go and the same to #return# with #one# #day# to discharge the commission entrusted to me is all the #time# i shall be absent
no no answered $m_dantès$ dont imagine i am going to put you off in that shabby #manner# i shall be back here by the first of march and on the second i give my real #marriage# feast
this prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the #guest# to such a degree that the elder $m_dantès$ who at the commencement of the repast had commented upon the #silence# that prevailed now found it difficult amid the general din of #voice# to obtain a #moment#
$m_dantès$ perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his #father# responded by a #look# of grateful #pleasure# while $mercédès$ glanced at the clock and made an expressive gesture to $edmond_dantès$
around the #table# reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at such a #time# among #people# sufficiently free from the demands of social #position# not to feel the trammels of etiquette
such as at the commencement of the repast had not been able to #seat# themselves according to their inclination rose unceremoniously and sought out more agreeable #companion#
everybody talked at once without waiting for a reply and each #one# seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own #thought#
tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride and bridegroom $m_fernand_mondego$ paleness appeared to have communicated itself to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
as for $m_fernand_mondego$ himself he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the damned unable to #rest# he was among the first to quit the #table# and as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening #sound# he continued in utter #silence# to pace the farther #end# of the salon
$m_caderousse$ approached him just as $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ whom $m_fernand_mondego$ seemed most anxious to avoid had joined him in a #corner# of the #room#
upon my #word# said $m_caderousse$ from whose #mind# the friendly treatment of $m_dantès$ united with the #effect# of the excellent wine he had partaken of had effaced every #feeling# of envy or jealousy at $m_dantès$ good
#fortune# upon my #word# $m_dantès$ is a downright good #fellow# and when i see him sitting there beside his pretty #wife# that is so soon to be
i cannot help thinking it would have been a great #pity# to have served him that trick you were planning #yesterday#
oh there was no harm meant answered $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ at first i certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what $m_fernand_mondego$ might be tempted to do but when i saw how completely he had mastered his #feeling# even so far as to become #one# of his rival attendants i knew there was no further cause for apprehension
$m_caderousse$ looked full at $m_fernand_mondego$ he was ghastly pale certainly continued $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ the sacrifice was no trifling #one# when the beauty of the bride is concerned
upon my soul that future #captain# of mine is a lucky dog gad i only #wish# he would let me take his #place#
asked the sweet silvery #voice# of $mercédès$ two clock has just struck and you know we are expected in a #quarter# of an #hour#
shall we not set forth to be sure to be sure cried $m_dantès$ eagerly quitting the #table# let us go directly
at this #moment# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who had been incessantly observing every change in $m_fernand_mondego$ #look# and #manner# saw him stagger and fall back with an almost convulsive spasm against a #seat# placed near #one# of the open #window#
at the same #instant# his ear caught a #sort# of indistinct #sound# on the stairs followed by the measured tread of soldiery with the clanking of swords and military accoutrements then came a hum and buzz as of many #voice# so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party among whom a vague #feeling# of curiosity and apprehension quelled every disposition to talk and almost instantaneously the most deathlike stillness prevailed
his #word# were re echoed by the whole party with vociferous cheers the #sound# drew nearer three blows were struck upon the panel of the #door#
the company looked at each #other# in consternation i demand admittance said a loud #voice# outside the #room# in the #name# of the #law#
as no attempt was made to prevent it the #door# was opened and a #magistrate# wearing his official scarf presented himself followed by four #soldier# and a corporal
may i venture to inquire the #reason# of this unexpected #visit# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ addressing the #magistrate# whom he evidently knew
uneasiness now yielded to the most extreme dread on the #part# of those present there is doubtless some mistake easily explained
if it be so replied the #magistrate# rely upon every reparation being made meanwhile i am the bearer of an #order# of arrest and although i most reluctantly perform the task assigned me it must nevertheless be fulfilled
every #eye# was turned towards the young #man# who #spite# of the agitation he could not but feel advanced with dignity and said in a firm #voice#
who among the #person# here assembled #answer# to the #name# of $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ i am he what is your #pleasure# with me
$edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ replied the #magistrate# i arrest you in the #name# of the #law# me repeated $edmond_dantès$ slightly changing color and wherefore i pray
i cannot inform you but you #will# be duly acquainted with the #reason# that have rendered such a #step# necessary at the preliminary examination
he saw before him an #officer# delegated to enforce the #law# and perfectly well knew that it would be as unavailing to seek #pity# from a #magistrate# decked with his official scarf as to address a petition to some cold marble effigy
$m_maximilian_morrel$ felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless old $m_dantès$ however sprang forward there are situations which the #heart# of a #father# or a #mother# cannot be made to understand
he prayed and supplicated in terms so moving that even the #officer# was touched and although firm in his #duty# he kindly said my worthy #friend# let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions
your #son# has probably neglected some prescribed form or #attention# in registering his cargo and it is more than probable he #will# be set at #liberty#
directly he has given the information required whether touching the health of his crew or the value of his freight
what is the meaning of all this inquired $m_caderousse$ frowningly of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who had assumed an #air# of utter surprise
i am like yourself utterly bewildered at all that is going on and cannot in the least make out what it is about
how can i tell you replied he $m_caderousse$ then looked around for $m_fernand_mondego$ but he had disappeared
the painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the #evening# before had raised between himself and his memory
the #scene# of the previous #night# now came back to his #mind# with startling clearness so so said he in a hoarse and choking #voice# to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
all i can say is that if it be so tis an ill #turn# and well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it
i tell you again i have #nothing# whatever to do with it besides you know very well that i tore the #paper# to #piece#
this then i suppose is a #part# of the trick you were concerting #yesterday# nonsense returned $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
no you did not answered $m_caderousse$ you merely threw it by i saw it lying in a #corner#
hold your tongue you fool what should you know about it why you were drunk where is $m_fernand_mondego$ inquired $m_caderousse$
how do i know replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ gone as every prudent #man# ought to be to #look# after his own #affair# most likely
never #mind# where he is let you and i go and see what is to be done for our poor #friend#
during this #conversation# $m_dantès$ after having exchanged a cheerful shake of the #hand# with all his sympathizing #friend# had surrendered himself to the #officer# sent to arrest him merely saying make yourselves quite easy my good #fellow# there is some little mistake to clear up that all depend upon it and very likely i may not have to go so far as the #prison# to #effect# that
oh to be sure responded $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who had now approached the group #nothing# more than a mistake i feel quite certain
a #carriage# awaited him at the #door# he got in followed by two #soldier# and the #magistrate# and the vehicle drove off towards marseilles
$m_dantès$ descended the #staircase# preceded by the #magistrate# and followed by the #soldier# adieu adieu dearest $edmond_dantès$ cried $mercédès$ stretching out her #arm# to him from the balcony
the #prisoner# heard the #cry# which sounded like the sob of a broken #heart# and leaning from the coach he called out
good bye $mercédès$ we shall soon meet again then the vehicle disappeared round #one# of the turnings of fort saint nicholas
wait for me here all of you cried $m_maximilian_morrel$ i #will# take the first conveyance i find and hurry to marseilles whence
i #will# bring you #word# how all is going on that #right# exclaimed a multitude of #voice# go and #return# as quickly as you can
this second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of terrified #silence# on the #part# of those who were left behind
the old #father# and $mercédès$ remained for some #time# apart each absorbed in #grief# but at #length# the two poor victims of the same blow raised their #eye# and with a simultaneous burst of #feeling# rushed into each #other# #arm#
meanwhile $m_fernand_mondego$ made his #appearance# poured out for himself a #glass# of #water# with a trembling #hand# then hastily swallowing it went to sit down at the first vacant #place# and this was by mere #chance# placed next to the #seat# on which poor $mercédès$ had fallen #half# fainting when released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old $m_dantès$
instinctively $m_fernand_mondego$ drew back his #chair# he is the cause of all this misery i am quite sure of it whispered $m_caderousse$ who had never taken his #eye# off $m_fernand_mondego$ to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
i dont think so answered the #other# he too stupid to imagine such a scheme i only #hope# the mischief #will# fall upon the #head# of whoever wrought it
you dont mention those who aided and abetted the deed said $m_caderousse$ surely answered $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #one# cannot be held responsible for every #chance# arrow shot into the #air#
you can indeed when the arrow #light# #point# downward on somebody #head# meantime the #subject# of the arrest was being canvassed in every different form
what think you $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said #one# of the party turning towards him of this #event# why replied he
i think it just possible $m_dantès$ may have been detected with some trifling article on #board# ship considered here as contraband
but how could he have done so without your knowledge $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ since you are the ship supercargo
why as for that i could only know what i was told respecting the merchandise with which the #vessel# was laden
i know she was loaded with cotton and that she took in her freight at alexandria from pastret warehouse and at smyrna from pascal that is all i was obliged to know and i beg i may not be asked for any further particulars
now i recollect said the afflicted old #father# my poor #boy# told me #yesterday# he had got a small #case# of coffee and another of tobacco for me
now the mischief is out depend upon it the custom $house_of_peers$ #people# went rummaging about the ship in our absence and discovered poor $m_dantès$ hidden #treasure#
there you see exclaimed $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mercédès$ however paid no heed to this explanation of her lover arrest
her #grief# which she had hitherto tried to restrain now burst out in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing come come said the old #man# be comforted my poor #child# there is still #hope#
faintly murmured $m_fernand_mondego$ but the #word# seemed to die away on his pale agitated #lip# and a convulsive spasm passed over his #countenance#
#hope# repeated $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #hope# good news good news shouted forth #one# of the party stationed in the balcony on the lookout
no #doubt# now we shall hear that our #friend# is released $mercédès$ and the old #man# rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at the #door#
alas my #friend# replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ with a mournful shake of his #head# the #thing# has assumed a more serious aspect than i expected
here comes $m_maximilian_morrel$ back he was very pale what news exclaimed a general burst of #voice#
oh indeed indeed #sir# he is innocent sobbed forth $mercédès$ that i believe answered $m_maximilian_morrel$ but still he is charged
with being an agent of the bonapartist faction many of our readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the period at which our #story# is dated
with what inquired the elder $m_dantès$ a despairing #cry# escaped the pale #lip# of $mercédès$ the old #man# sank into a #chair#
the trick you spoke of last #night# has been played but i cannot suffer a poor old #man# or an innocent #girl# to die of #grief# through your fault
ah $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ whispered $m_caderousse$ you have deceived me i am determined to tell them all about it
be silent you simpleton cried $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ grasping him by the #arm# or i #will# not #answer# even for your own safety
who can tell whether $m_dantès$ be innocent or guilty the #vessel# did touch at $elba$ where he quitted it and passed a whole #day# in the #island#
now should any #letter# or #other# documents of a compromising character be found upon him #will# it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices
with the rapid instinct of selfishness $m_caderousse$ readily perceived the solidity of this mode of reasoning he gazed doubtfully wistfully on $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and then caution supplanted generosity
suppose we wait a while and see what comes of it said he casting a bewildered #look# on his #companion#
if he be innocent of #course# he #will# be set at #liberty# if guilty why it is no #use# involving ourselves in a conspiracy
to be sure answered $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ let us wait by all #mean# let us go then i cannot stay here any longer
with all my #heart# replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ pleased to find the #other# so tractable let us take ourselves out of the #way# and leave #thing# for the present to take their #course#
after their departure $m_fernand_mondego$ who had now again become the #friend# and protector of $mercédès$ led the #girl# to her home while some #friend# of $m_dantès$ conducted his #father# nearly lifeless to the allées de meilhan
could you ever have credited such a #thing# my dear $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ as on his #return# to the port for the #purpose# of gleaning fresh tidings of $m_dantès$ from $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the assistant #procureur# he overtook his supercargo and $m_caderousse$
the rumor of $edmond_dantès$ arrest as a bonapartist agent was not slow in circulating throughout the city could you have believed such a #thing# possible
why you know i told you replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ that i considered the #circumstance# of his having anchored at the #island# of $elba$ as a very suspicious #circumstance#
and did you mention these suspicions to any #person# beside myself certainly not returned $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
you understand that on #account# of your uncle policar $m_maximilian_morrel$ who served under the #other# government and who does not altogether conceal what he thinks on the #subject# you are strongly suspected of regretting the abdication of $napoleon$
then added in a low whisper i should have feared to injure both $edmond_dantès$ and yourself had i divulged my own apprehensions to a soul
i am too well aware that though a subordinate like myself is bound to acquaint the shipowner with #everything# that occurs there are many #thing# he ought most carefully to conceal from all else
you are a worthy #fellow# and i had already #thought# of your #interest# in the #event# of poor $edmond_dantès$ having become #captain# of the $pharaon$
tis well $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ tis well replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ is it possible you were so kind
yes indeed i had previously inquired of $m_dantès$ what was his #opinion# of you and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your post for somehow i have perceived a #sort# of coolness between you
that he certainly did think he had given you offence in an #affair# which he merely referred to without entering into particulars but that whoever possessed the good #opinion# and confidence of the ship
and what was his reply owners would have his preference also the hypocrite murmured $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
poor $m_dantès$ said $m_caderousse$ no #one# can deny his being a noble hearted young #fellow# but meanwhile continued $m_maximilian_morrel$ here is the $pharaon$ without a #captain#
oh replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ since we cannot leave this port for the next three #month# let us #hope# that ere the expiration of that period $m_dantès$ #will# be set at #liberty#
no #doubt# but in the meantime i am entirely at your #service# $m_maximilian_morrel$ answered $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
you know that i am as capable of managing a ship as the most experienced #captain# in the #service# and it #will# be so far advantageous to you to accept my #service# that upon $edmond_dantès$ release from #prison# no further change #will# be requisite on #board# the $pharaon$ than for $m_dantès$ and myself each to resume our respective posts
i fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the $pharaon$ and #look# carefully to the unloading of her freight
#thank# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ that #will# smooth over all difficulties private #misfortune# must never be allowed to interfere with #business#
be easy on that score $m_maximilian_morrel$ but do you think we shall be permitted to see our poor $edmond_dantès$
i #will# let you know that directly i have seen $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ whom i shall endeavor to #interest# in $edmond_dantès$ favor
i am aware he is a furious royalist but in #spite# of that and of his being #king# attorney he is a #man# like ourselves and i fancy not a bad #sort# of #one#
perhaps not replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ but i hear that he is ambitious and that rather against him
well well returned $m_maximilian_morrel$ we shall see but now hasten on #board# i #will# join you there ere long
so saying the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies and proceeded in the direction of the palais de #justice#
m you see said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ addressing $m_caderousse$ the #turn# #thing# have taken do you still feel any #desire# to stand up in his defence
not the slightest but yet it seems to me a shocking #thing# that a mere joke should lead to such consequences
neither you nor myself but $m_fernand_mondego$ you knew very well that i threw the #paper# into a #corner# of the #room#
but who perpetrated that joke let me ask indeed i fancied i had destroyed it
i only #wish# i could see it now as plainly as i saw it lying all crushed and crumpled in a #corner# of the arbor
well then if you did depend upon it $m_fernand_mondego$ picked it up and either copied it or caused it to be copied perhaps even he did not take the trouble of recopying it
oh no replied $m_caderousse$ that i can #answer# for you did not and now i think of it by heavens he may have sent the #letter# itself
fortunately for me the handwriting was disguised then you were aware of $m_dantès$ being engaged in a conspiracy
not i as i before said i #thought# the whole #thing# was a joke #nothing# more it seems however that i have unconsciously stumbled upon the #truth#
still argued $m_caderousse$ i would give a great deal if #nothing# of the kind had happened or at least that i had had no #hand# in it
you #will# see $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ that it #will# #turn# out an unlucky job for both of us nonsense if any harm come of it it should fall on the guilty #person# and that you know is $m_fernand_mondego$
all we have got to do is to keep our own counsel and remain perfectly quiet not breathing a #word# to any living soul and you #will# see that the storm #will# pass away without in the least affecting us
responded $m_caderousse$ waving his #hand# in token of adieu to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and bending his #step# towards the allées de meilhan moving his #head# to and fro and muttering as he went after the #manner# of #one# whose #mind# was overcharged with #one# absorbing #idea#
how can we be implicated in any #way# amen so far then said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ mentally all has gone as i would have it
i am temporarily commander of the $pharaon$ with the certainty of being permanently so if that fool of a $m_caderousse$ can be persuaded to hold his tongue
my only #fear# is the #chance# of $m_dantès$ being released but there he is in the #hand# of #justice# and added he with a #smile# she #will# take her own
so saying he leaped into a #boat# desiring to be rowed on #board# the $pharaon$ where $m_maximilian_morrel$ had agreed to meet him
in #one# of the aristocratic mansions built by puget in the rue du grand cours opposite the medusa fountain a second #marriage# feast was being celebrated almost at the same #hour# with the nuptial repast given by $m_dantès$
#chapter# the deputy #procureur# du roi in this #case# however although the occasion of the entertainment was similar the company was strikingly dissimilar
instead of a rude mixture of #sailor# #soldier# and those belonging to the humblest grade of #life# the present assembly was composed of the very flower of marseilles society #magistrate# who had resigned their office during the usurper reign #officer# who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with condé and younger members of #family# brought up to hate and execrate the #man# whom five #year# of exile would convert into a martyr and fifteen of restoration elevate to the rank of a god
the #guest# were still at #table# and the heated and energetic #conversation# that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then agitated each dweller of the south where unhappily for five centuries religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of party #feeling#
the emperor now #king# of the petty #island# of $elba$ after having held sovereign sway over #one# #half# of the #world# counting as his #subject# a small population of five or six thousand souls after having been accustomed to hear the vive napoléons of a hundred and twenty #million# of human beings uttered in ten different languages was looked upon here as a ruined #man# separated forever from any fresh connection with france or claim to her throne
the #magistrate# freely discussed their political views the military #part# of the company talked unreservedly of moscow and leipsic while the #woman# commented on the divorce of josephine
it was not over the downfall of the #man# but over the defeat of the napoleonic #idea# that they rejoiced and in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a revivified political existence
an old #man# decorated with the cross of saint $louis_xviii$ now rose and proposed the health of #king# $louis_xviii$ it was the marquis de $madame_de_saint_méran$
this toast recalling at once the patient exile of hartwell and the peace loving #king# of france excited universal enthusiasm #glass# were elevated in the #air# l anglaise and the #lady# snatching their bouquets from their fair bosoms strewed the #table# with their floral #treasure#
ah said the marquise de $madame_de_saint_méran$ a #woman# with a stern forbidding #eye# though still noble and distinguished in #appearance# despite her fifty #year# ah these revolutionists who have driven us from those very #possession# they afterwards purchased for a mere trifle during the reign of #terror# would be compelled to own were they here that all true devotion was on our #side# since we were content to follow the #fortune# of a falling monarch while they on the #contrary# made their #fortune# by worshipping the rising sun yes yes they could not help admitting that the #king# for whom we sacrificed rank wealth and station was truly our $louis_xviii$ the well beloved while their wretched usurper has been and ever #will# be to them their evil genius their $napoleon$ the accursed
in a #word# an almost poetical fervor prevailed am i not #right# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i beg your pardon #madame#
marquise marquise interposed the old nobleman who had proposed the toast let the young #people# alone let me tell you on #one# wedding #day# there are more agreeable #subject# of #conversation# than dry politics
i really must pray you to excuse me but in #truth# i was not attending to the #conversation#
never #mind# dearest #mother# said a young and lovely #girl# with a profusion of #light# brown #hair# and #eye# that seemed to float in liquid crystal
tis all my fault for seizing upon $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ so as to prevent his listening to what you said but there now take him
he is your own for as long as you like $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i beg to remind you my #mother# speaks to you
if the marquise #will# deign to repeat the #word# i but imperfectly caught i shall be delighted to #answer# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
never #mind# $renée$ replied the marquise with a #look# of tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry #feature# but however all #other# #feeling# may be withered in a #woman# #nature# there is always #one# bright smiling #spot# in the desert of her #heart# and that is the shrine of maternal #love#
i forgive you what i was saying $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was that the bonapartists had not our sincerity enthusiasm or devotion
they had however what supplied the #place# of those fine qualities replied the young #man# and that was fanaticism
$napoleon$ is the mahomet of the west and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious followers not only as a leader and lawgiver but also as the personification of equality
he cried the marquise $napoleon$ the type of equality for mercy sake then what would you call robespierre
come come do not strip the latter of his just #right# to bestow them on the corsican who to my #mind# has usurped quite enough
that of robespierre on his scaffold in the #place# $louis_xviii$ quinze that of $napoleon$ on the column of the #place# vendôme
the only difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by these two #man# #one# is the equality that elevates the #other# is the equality that degrades #one# brings a #king# within reach of the guillotine the #other# elevates the #people# to a level with the throne
nay #madame# i would #place# each of these heroes on his #right# pedestal observe said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ smiling
i do not #mean# to deny that both these #man# were revolutionary scoundrels and that the th thermidor and the th of april in the #year# were lucky #day# for france worthy of being gratefully remembered by every #friend# to monarchy and civil #order# and that explains how it comes to pass that fallen as i trust he is forever $napoleon$ has still retained a train of parasitical satellites
still marquise it has been so with #other# usurpers cromwell for instance who was not #half# so bad as $napoleon$ had his partisans and advocates
but i excuse it it is impossible to expect the #son# of a girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven
do you know $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ that you are talking in a most dreadfully revolutionary strain a deep crimson suffused the #countenance# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
tis true #madame# answered he that my #father# was a girondin but he was not among the number of those who voted for the #king# #death# he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the reign of #terror# and had well nigh lost his #head# on the same scaffold on which your #father# perished
true replied the marquise without wincing in the slightest degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up but bear in #mind# if you please that our respective parents underwent persecution and proscription from diametrically opposite principles in #proof# of which i may remark that while my #family# remained among the staunchest adherents of the exiled princes your #father# lost no #time# in joining the new government and that while the citizen $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was a girondin the #count# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ became a senator
dear #mother# interposed $renée$ you know very well it was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be laid aside
suffer me also #madame# replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ to add my earnest request to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ de $madame_de_saint_méran$ that you #will# kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past
what avails recrimination over #matter# wholly past recall for my own #part# i have laid aside even the #name# of my #father# and altogether disown his political principles
he was nay probably may still be a bonapartist and is called $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i on the #contrary# am a staunch royalist and style myself $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
let what may remain of revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk and condescend only to regard the young shoot which has started up at a #distance# from the parent #tree# without having the #power# any more than the #wish# to separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung
come now i have #hope# of obtaining what i have been for #year# endeavoring to persuade the marquise to #promise# namely a perfect amnesty and forgetfulness of the past
bravo $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ cried the marquis excellently well said with all my #heart# replied the marquise let the past be forever forgotten
i #promise# you it affords me as little #pleasure# to revive it as it does you all i ask is that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #will# be firm and inflexible for the future in his political principles
remember also $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your fealty and strict loyalty and that at our recommendation the #king# consented to forget the past as i do and here she extended to him her #hand# as
but bear in #mind# that should there fall in your #way# #anyone# guilty of conspiring against the government you #will# be so much the more bound to #visit# the offence with rigorous punishment as it is known you belong to a suspected #family#
i now do at your entreaty alas #madame# returned $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ my profession as well as the #time# in which we live compels me to be severe
i have already successfully conducted several public prosecutions and brought the offenders to merited punishment but we have not done with the #thing# yet
do you indeed think so inquired the marquise i am at least fearful of it $napoleon$ in the #island# of $elba$ is too near france and his proximity keeps up the #hope# of his partisans
marseilles is filled with #half# pay #officer# who are daily under #one# frivolous pretext or #other# getting up quarrels with the royalists from hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of #person# and assassinations in the lower
you have heard perhaps said the comte de salvieux #one# of de $madame_de_saint_méran$ oldest #friend# and chamberlain to the comte artois that the holy alliance #purpose# removing him from thence
yes they were talking about it when we left paris said de $madame_de_saint_méran$ and where is it decided to transfer him
to saint helena for heaven sake where is that asked the marquise an #island# situated on the #other# #side# of the equator at least two thousand leagues from here replied the #count#
as $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ observes it is a great act of folly to have left such a #man# between corsica where he was born and naples of which his #brother# in #law# is #king# and #face# to #face# with italy the sovereignty of which he coveted for his #son#
so much the better unfortunately said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ there are the treaties of and we cannot molest $napoleon$ without breaking those compacts
oh well we shall find some #way# out of it responded de salvieux there wasnt any trouble over treaties when it was a #question# of shooting the poor duc enghien
it seems probable that by the aid of the holy alliance we shall be rid of $napoleon$ and we must trust to the vigilance of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ to purify marseilles of his partisans
the #king# is either a #king# or no #king# if he be acknowledged as sovereign of france he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracy tis the best and surest #mean# of preventing mischief
unfortunately #madame# answered $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the strong #arm# of the #law# is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken #place#
well said the marquise then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it
nay #madame# the #law# is frequently powerless to #effect# this all it can do is to avenge the wrong done
oh $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ cried a beautiful young creature #daughter# to the comte de salvieux and the cherished #friend# of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ de $madame_de_saint_méran$ do try and get up some famous trial while we are at marseilles
i never was in a #law# #court# i am told it is so very amusing amusing certainly replied the young #man#
instead of shedding #tear# as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at a theatre you behold in a #law# #court# a #case# of real and genuine distress
as is the #case# when a curtain falls on a tragedy going home to sup peacefully with his #family# and then retiring to #rest# that he may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow is removed from your #sight# merely to be reconducted to his #prison# and delivered up to the executioner
inasmuch as a drama of #life# the #prisoner# whom you there see pale agitated and alarmed instead of i leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to bear you through such a #scene#
of this however be assured that should any favorable opportunity present itself i #will# not fail to offer you the choice of being present
for shame $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ said $renée$ becoming quite pale dont you see how you are frightening us and yet you laugh
i have already recorded sentence of #death# five or six #time# against the movers of political conspiracies and who can say how many daggers may be ready sharpened and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my #heart#
what would you have tis like a duel gracious heavens $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ said $renée$ becoming more and more terrified you surely are not in earnest
indeed i am replied the young #magistrate# with a #smile# and in the interesting trial that young #lady# is anxious to witness the #case# would only be still more aggravated
well can you expect for an #instant# that #one# accustomed at the #word# of his commander to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe #will# scruple more to drive a stiletto into the #heart# of #one# he knows to be his personal #enemy# than to slaughter his #fellow# creatures merely because bidden to do so by #one# he is bound to obey
besides #one# requires the excitement of being hateful in the #eye# of the accused in #order# to lash #one# self into a state of sufficient vehemence and #power#
suppose for instance the #prisoner# as is more than probable to have served under $napoleon$ i would not choose to see the #man# against whom i pleaded #smile# as though in mockery of my #word#
no my pride is to see the accused pale agitated and as though beaten out of all composure by the #fire# of my eloquence
$renée$ uttered a smothered exclamation bravo cried #one# of the #guest# that is what i call talking to some #purpose#
just the #person# we require at a #time# like the present said a second what a splendid #business# that last #case# of yours was my dear $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
remarked a third i #mean# the trial of the #man# for murdering his #father# upon my #word# you killed him
ere the executioner had laid his #hand# upon him oh as for parricides and such dreadful #people# as that interposed $renée$
it #matter# very little what is done to them but as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only #crime# consists in having mixed themselves up in political intrigues
dont you see $renée$ the #king# is the #father# of his #people# and he who shall plot or contrive aught against the #life# and safety of the parent of thirty two #million# of souls is a parricide upon a fearfully great scale
why that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit for i dont know #anything# about that replied $renée$
but $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ you have promised me have you not always to show mercy to those i plead for
make yourself quite easy on that #point# answered $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with #one# of his sweetest #smile# you and i #will# always consult upon our verdicts
my #love# said the marquise attend to your doves your lap dogs and embroidery but do not meddle with what you do not understand
nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the magisterial robe is the badge of #honor# there is a wise latin proverb that is very much in #point#
cedant arma togæ said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with a bow i cannot speak latin responded the marquise well said $renée$
i cannot help regretting you had not chosen some #other# profession than your own a physician for instance do you know i always felt a shudder at the #idea# of even a destroying angel
let us #hope# my #child# cried the marquis that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ may prove the moral and political physician of this province if so he #will# have achieved a noble #work#
dear good $renée$ whispered $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ as he gazed with unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker and #one# which #will# go far to efface the recollection of his #father# conduct added the incorrigible marquise
#madame# replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with a mournful #smile# i have already had the #honor# to observe that my #father# has at least
i #hope# so abjured his past errors and that he is at the present #moment# a firm and zealous #friend# to religion and #order# a better royalist possibly than his #son# for he has to atone for past dereliction while i have no #other# impulse than warm decided preference and conviction
having made this well turned speech $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looked carefully around to mark the #effect# of his oratory much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open #court#
that is exactly what i myself said the #other# #day# at the tuileries when questioned by his majesty principal chamberlain touching the singularity of an alliance between the #son# of a girondin and the #daughter# of an #officer# of the duc de condé and i assure you he seemed fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences was based upon #sound# and excellent principles
then the #king# who without our suspecting it had overheard our #conversation# interrupted us by saying $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ observe that the #king# did not pronounce the #word# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ but on the #contrary# placed considerable emphasis on that of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ villefort said his majesty
is a young #man# of great judgment and discretion who #will# be sure to make a figure in his profession i like him much and it gave me great #pleasure# to hear that he was about to become the #son# in #law# of the marquis and marquise de $madame_de_saint_méran$
i should myself have recommended the match had not the noble marquis anticipated my #wish# by requesting my consent to it
do you know my dear $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ cried the comte de salvieux is it possible the #king# could have condescended so far as to express himself so favorably of me
i give you his very #word# and if the marquis chooses to be candid he #will# confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to him when he went six #month# ago to consult him upon the #subject# of your espousing his #daughter#
asked the enraptured $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ that is true answered the marquis how much do i owe this gracious prince
what is there i would not do to evince my earnest gratitude that is #right# cried the marquise i #love# to see you thus
now then were a conspirator to fall into your #hand# he would be most welcome for my #part# dear #mother# interposed $renée$
i trust your #wish# #will# not prosper and that providence #will# only permit petty offenders poor debtors and miserable cheats to fall into $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #hand# then i shall be contented
just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be called upon to prescribe for headaches measles and the stings of wasps or any #other# slight affection of the epidermis
if you #wish# to see me the #king# attorney you must #desire# for me some of those violent and dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much #honor# redounds to the physician
at this #moment# and as though the utterance of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #wish# had sufficed to #effect# its accomplishment a #servant# entered the #room# and whispered a few #word# in his ear
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ immediately rose from #table# and quitted the #room# upon the plea of urgent #business# he soon however returned his whole #face# beaming with delight
$renée$ regarded him with fond affection and certainly his handsome #feature# lit up as they then were with more than usual #fire# and animation seemed formed to excite the innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent lover
you were wishing just now said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ addressing her that i were a #doctor# instead of a lawyer
well i at least resemble the disciples of esculapius in #one# #thing# #people# spoke in this style in that of not being able to call a #day# my own not even that of my betrothal
and wherefore were you called away just now asked $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ de $madame_de_saint_méran$ with an #air# of deep #interest#
for a very serious #matter# which bids fair to make #work# for the executioner how dreadful exclaimed $renée$ turning pale
is it possible burst simultaneously from all who were near enough to the #magistrate# to hear his #word# why if my information prove correct a #sort# of bonapartist conspiracy has just been discovered
can i believe my ears cried the marquise i #will# read you the #letter# containing the accusation at least said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
the #king# attorney is informed by a #friend# to the throne and the religious institutions of his #country# that #one# named $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ mate of the ship $pharaon$ this #day# arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been the bearer of a #letter# from murat to the usurper and again taken charge of another #letter# from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris
ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above mentioned $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ who either carries the #letter# for paris about with him or has it at his #father#
should it not be found in the #possession# of #father# or #son# then it #will# assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said $m_dantès$ on #board# the $pharaon$
this #letter# which after all is but an anonymous scrawl is not even addressed to you but to the #king# attorney
true but that #gentleman# being absent his secretary by his #order# opened his #letter# thinking this #one# of importance he sent for me but not finding me took upon himself to give the necessary #order# for arresting the accused party
abode but said $renée$ then the guilty #person# is absolutely in custody said the marquise
nay dear #mother# say the accused #person# you know we cannot yet pronounce him guilty he is in safe custody answered $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
and rely upon it if the #letter# is found he #will# not be likely to be trusted abroad again unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the headsman
and where is the unfortunate being asked $renée$ he is at my $house_of_peers$ come come my #friend# interrupted the marquise
do not neglect your #duty# to linger with us you are the #king# #servant# and must go wherever that #service# calls you
oh $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ cried $renée$ clasping her #hand# and looking towards her lover with piteous earnestness be merciful on this the #day# of our betrothal
the young #man# passed round to the #side# of the #table# where the fair pleader sat and leaning over her #chair# said tenderly to give you #pleasure# my sweet $renée$ i #promise# to show all the lenity in my #power# but if the charges brought against this bonapartist hero prove correct why then you really must give me leave to #order# his #head# to be cut off
$renée$ shuddered at the #word# cut for the growth in #question# had a #head# never #mind# that foolish #girl# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ said the marquise
so saying $madame_de_saint_méran$ extended her dry bony #hand# to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who while imprinting a #son# in #law# respectful salute on it looked at $renée$ as much as to say i must try and fancy tis your dear #hand# i kiss as it should have been
she #will# soon get over these #thing# these are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal sighed poor $renée$
i should be glad to know what connection there can possibly be between your sickly sentimentality and the #affair# of the state
upon my #word# #child# exclaimed the angry marquise your folly exceeds all bounds oh #mother# murmured $renée$
i #promise# you that to make up for her want of loyalty i #will# be most inflexibly severe then casting an expressive #glance# at his betrothed which seemed to say
#fear# not for your dear sake my #justice# shall be tempered with mercy and receiving a sweet and approving #smile# in #return# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ departed with paradise in his #heart#
no sooner had $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ left the salon than he assumed the grave #air# of a #man# who holds the balance of #life# and #death# in his #hand#
now in #spite# of the nobility of his #countenance# the command of which like a finished actor he had carefully studied before the #glass# it was by no #mean# easy for him to assume an #air# of judicial severity
except the recollection of the #line# of politics his #father# had adopted and which might interfere unless he acted with the greatest prudence with his own career gérard $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was as happy as a #man# could be
nay #madame# i pray you pardon this little traitor #chapter# the examination already rich he held a high official situation though only twenty seven
he was about to marry a young and charming #woman# whom he loved not passionately but reasonably as became a deputy attorney of the #king# and besides her personal attractions which were very great $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ de $madame_de_saint_méran$ #family# possessed considerable political influence which they would of #course# exert in his favor
the dowry of his #wife# amounted to fifty thousand crowns and he had besides the prospect of seeing her #fortune# increased to #half# a #million# at her #father# #death#
these considerations naturally gave $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ a #feeling# of such complete felicity that his #mind# was fairly dazzled in its contemplation at the #door# he met the commissary of #police# who was waiting for him
the #sight# of this #officer# recalled $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ from the third heaven to #earth# he composed his #face# as we have before described and said i have read the #letter# #sir# and you have acted rightly in arresting this #man# now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the conspiracy
we know #nothing# as yet of the conspiracy $monsieur_cavalcanti$ all the #paper# found have been sealed up and placed on your desk
the #prisoner# himself is named $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ mate on #board# the three #master# the $pharaon$ trading in cotton with alexandria and smyrna and belonging to $m_maximilian_morrel$ #son# of marseilles
before he entered the merchant #service# had he ever served in the marines oh no $monsieur_cavalcanti$ he is very young
at this #moment# and as $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had arrived at the #corner# of the rue des conseils a #man# who seemed to have been waiting for him approached it was $m_maximilian_morrel$
how old nineteen or twenty at the most ah $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ cried he
i am delighted to see you some of your #people# have committed the strangest mistake they have just arrested $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ mate of my #vessel#
i know it $monsieur_cavalcanti$ replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and i am now going to examine him oh said $m_maximilian_morrel$ carried away by his friendship
he is the most estimable the most trustworthy creature in the #world# and i #will# venture to say there is not a better seaman in all the merchant #service#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ as we have seen belonged to the aristocratic party at marseilles $m_maximilian_morrel$ to the plebeian the first was a royalist the #other# suspected of bonapartism
you do not know him and i do oh $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i beseech your indulgence for him $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looked disdainfully at $m_maximilian_morrel$ and replied coldly
you are aware $monsieur_cavalcanti$ that a #man# may be estimable and trustworthy in private #life# and the best seaman in the merchant #service# and yet be politically speaking a great criminal
the #magistrate# laid emphasis on these #word# as if he wished to apply them to the owner himself while his #eye# seemed to plunge into the #heart# of #one# who interceding for another had himself need of indulgence
$m_maximilian_morrel$ reddened for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics besides what $m_dantès$ had told him of his interview with the grand marshal and what the emperor had said to him embarrassed him
i entreat you $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ be as you always are kind and equitable and give him back to us soon
is it not true he replied however in a #tone# of deep #interest# this give us sounded revolutionary in the deputy ears
ah ah murmured he is $m_dantès$ then a member of some carbonari society that his protector thus employs the collective form
then he added $monsieur_cavalcanti$ you may #rest# assured i shall perform my #duty# impartially and that if he be innocent you shall not have appealed to me in vain should he however be guilty in this present epoch impunity would furnish a dangerous example and i must do my #duty#
as he had now arrived at the #door# of his own $house_of_peers$ which adjoined the palais de #justice# he entered after having coldly saluted the shipowner who stood as if petrified on the #spot# where $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had left him
the antechamber was full of #police# agents and gendarmes in the midst of whom carefully watched but calm and smiling stood the #prisoner#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ traversed the antechamber cast a #side# #glance# at $m_dantès$ and taking a packet which a gendarme offered him disappeared saying bring in the #prisoner#
rapid as had been $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #glance# it had served to give him an #idea# of the #man# he was about to interrogate
he had recognized intelligence in the high #forehead# courage in the dark #eye# and bent #brow# and frankness in the thick #lip# that showed a set of pearly teeth
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ first impression was favorable but he had been so often warned to mistrust first impulses that he applied the maxim to the impression forgetting the difference between the two #word#
he stifled therefore the #feeling# of compassion that were rising composed his #feature# and sat down grim and sombre at his desk
he was if i recollect arrested in a tavern in company with a great many #other# an #instant# after $m_dantès$ entered
he was pale but calm and collected and saluting his judge with easy politeness looked round for a #seat# as if he had been in
it was then that he encountered for the first #time# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #look# that #look# peculiar to the #magistrate# who while seeming to read the #thought# of #other# betrays #nothing# of his own
demanded $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ turning over a pile of #paper# containing information relative to the #prisoner# that a #police# agent had given to him on his entry and that already in an #hour# #time# had swelled to voluminous proportions #thank# to the corrupt espionage of which the accused is always made the victim
$m_maximilian_morrel$ salon who and what are you my #name# is $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ replied the young #man# calmly
i am mate of the $pharaon$ belonging to messrs $m_maximilian_morrel$ #son# your #age# continued $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
i was at the festival of my #marriage# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said the young #man# his #voice# slightly tremulous so great was the contrast between that happy #moment# and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing so great was the contrast between the sombre aspect of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and the radiant #face# of $mercédès$
nineteen returned $m_dantès$ what were you doing at the #moment# you were arrested you were at the festival of your #marriage# said the deputy shuddering in #spite# of himself
yes $monsieur_cavalcanti$ i am on the #point# of marrying a young #girl# i have been attached to for three #year#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ impassive as he was was struck with this coincidence and the tremulous #voice# of $m_dantès$ surprised in the midst of his #happiness# struck a sympathetic chord in his own bosom
he also was on the #point# of being married and he was summoned from his own #happiness# to destroy that of another
this philosophic reflection #thought# he #will# make a great sensation at de $madame_de_saint_méran$ and he arranged mentally while $m_dantès$ awaited further #question# the antithesis by which orators often create a reputation for eloquence
when this speech was arranged $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ turned to $m_dantès$ go on #sir# said he what would you have me say
tell me on which #point# you #desire# information and i #will# tell all i know only added he with a #smile#
give all the information in your #power# i warn you i know very little have you served under the usurper
it is reported your political #opinion# are extreme said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who had never heard #anything# of the kind but was not sorry to make this inquiry as if it were an accusation
i was about to be mustered into the royal marines when he fell my political #opinion# replied $m_dantès$
alas #sir# i never had any #opinion# i am hardly nineteen i know #nothing# i have no #part# to play
i #will# not say public but private are confined to these three sentiments i #love# my #father# i respect $m_maximilian_morrel$ and i adore $mercédès$
if i obtain the situation i #desire# i shall owe it to $m_maximilian_morrel$ thus all my #opinion# this #sir# is all i can tell you and you see how uninteresting it is
as $m_dantès$ spoke $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ gazed at his ingenuous and open #countenance# and recollected the #word# of $renée$ who without knowing who the culprit was had besought his indulgence for him
with the deputy knowledge of #crime# and criminals every #word# the young #man# uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence
this lad for he was scarcely a #man# simple natural eloquent with that eloquence of the #heart# never found when sought for full of affection for everybody because he was happy and because #happiness# renders
even the wicked good extended his affection even to his judge #spite# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ severe #look# and stern accent $m_dantès$ seemed full of kindness
$pardieu$ said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ he is a noble #fellow# i #hope# i shall gain $renée$ favor easily by obeying the first command she ever imposed on me
full of this #idea# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #face# became so joyous that when he turned to $m_dantès$ the latter who had watched the change on his physiognomy was smiling also
i shall have at least a pressure of the #hand# in public and a sweet kiss in private #sir# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ have you any #enemy# at least that you know
i have #enemy# replied $m_dantès$ my #position# is not sufficiently elevated for that as for my disposition that is perhaps somewhat too hasty but i have striven to repress it
i have had ten or twelve #sailor# under me and if you #question# them they #will# tell you that they #love# and respect me not as a #father# for i am too young but as an elder #brother#
you are about to become #captain# at nineteen an elevated post you are about to marry a pretty #girl# who loves you and these two #piece# of good #fortune# may have excited the envy of someone
you are #right# you know #man# better than i do and what you say may possibly be the #case# i confess but if such #person# are among my acquaintances i prefer not to know it because then i should be forced to hate them
but you may have excited jealousy you are wrong you should always strive to see clearly around you
you seem a worthy young #man# i #will# depart from the strict #line# of my #duty# to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation
here is the #paper# do you know the writing as he spoke $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ drew the #letter# from his #pocket# and presented it to $m_dantès$
$m_dantès$ read it a cloud passed over his #brow# as he said no $monsieur_cavalcanti$ i do not know the writing and yet it is tolerably plain
i am very fortunate added he looking gratefully at $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ to be examined by such a #man# as you for this envious #person# is a real #enemy#
and by the rapid #glance# that the young #man# #eye# shot forth $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ saw how much energy lay hid beneath this mildness
#answer# me frankly not as a #prisoner# to a judge but as #one# #man# to another who takes an #interest# in him what #truth# is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous #letter#
whoever did it writes well now said the deputy and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ threw disdainfully on his desk the #letter# $m_dantès$ had just given back to him
none at all i #will# tell you the real #fact# i swear by my #honor# as a #sailor# by my #love# for $mercédès$ by the #life# of my #father#
then internally if $renée$ could see me i #hope# she would be satisfied and would no longer call me a decapitator
as we had no #doctor# on #board# and he was so anxious to arrive at $elba$ that he would not touch at any #other# port his disorder rose to such a height that at the #end# of the third #day# #feeling# he was dying he called me to him
speak $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ well when we quitted naples #captain# $leclere$ was attacked with a brain fever my dear $m_dantès$ said he
swear to perform what i am going to tell you for it is a #matter# of the deepest importance
well as after my #death# the command devolves on you as mate assume the command and bear up for the #island# of $elba$ disembark at porto ferrajo ask for the grand marshal give him this #letter#
i swear #captain# replied i perhaps they #will# give you another #letter# and charge you with a commission
you #will# accomplish what i was to have done and derive all the #honor# and profit from it
i #will# do it #captain# but perhaps i shall not be admitted to the grand marshal #presence# as easily as you expect
here is a ring that #will# obtain audience of him and remove every difficulty said the #captain# at these #word# he gave me a ring
it was #time# two #hour# after he was delirious the next #day# he died and what did you do then
everywhere the last requests of a dying #man# are sacred but with a #sailor# the last requests of his superior are commands
i sailed for the #island# of $elba$ where i arrived the next #day# i ordered everybody to remain on #board# and went on shore alone
as i had expected i found some difficulty in obtaining access to the grand marshal but i sent the ring i had received from the #captain# to him and was instantly admitted
he questioned me concerning #captain# $leclere$ #death# and as the latter had told me gave me a #letter# to carry on to a #person# in paris
what i ought to have done and what #everyone# would have done in my #place# i undertook it because it was what my #captain# had bade me do
i landed here regulated the #affair# of the #vessel# and hastened to #visit# my affianced bride whom i found more lovely than ever
#thank# to $m_maximilian_morrel$ all the forms were got over in a #word# i was as i told you at my #marriage# feast and i should have been married in an #hour# and #tomorrow# i intended to start for paris had i not been arrested on this charge which you as well as i now see to be unjust
ah said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ this seems to me the #truth# if you have been culpable it was imprudence and this imprudence was in obedience to the #order# of your #captain#
give up this #letter# you have brought from $elba$ and pass your #word# you #will# appear should you be required and go and rejoin your #friend#
i am free then #sir# cried $m_dantès$ joyfully yes but first give me this #letter# you have it already for it was taken from me with some #other# which i see in that packet
stop a #moment# said the deputy as $m_dantès$ took his hat and gloves to whom is it addressed
to $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ rue coq héron paris had a thunderbolt fallen into the #room# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ could not have been more stupefied
he sank into his #seat# and hastily turning over the packet drew forth the fatal #letter# at which he glanced with an #expression# of #terror#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ rue coq héron no murmured he growing still paler yes said $m_dantès$ do you know him
no replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ a faithful #servant# of the #king# does not know conspirators it is a conspiracy then asked $m_dantès$ who after believing himself free now began to feel a tenfold alarm
i have however already told you #sir# i was entirely ignorant of the contents of the #letter# yes but you knew the #name# of the #person# to whom it was addressed said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
i was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it have you shown this #letter# to #anyone#
everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a #letter# from the #island# of $elba$ and addressed to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
asked $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ becoming still more pale to no #one# on my #honor# everybody except the #person# who gave it to me
and that was too much far too much murmured $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ villefort #brow# darkened more and more his white #lip# and clenched teeth filled $m_dantès$ with apprehension
after reading the #letter# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ covered his #face# with his #hand# oh said $m_dantès$ timidly what is the #matter#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ made no #answer# but raised his #head# at the expiration of a few seconds and again perused the #letter#
and you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this #letter# i give you my #word# of #honor# #sir# said $m_dantès$
but what is the #matter# you are ill shall i ring for assistance shall i call no said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ rising hastily
stay where you are it is for me to give #order# here and not you $monsieur_cavalcanti$ replied $m_dantès$ proudly
it was only to summon assistance for you i want none it was a temporary indisposition attend to yourself #answer# me
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ fell back on his #chair# passed his #hand# over his #brow# moist with perspiration and for the third #time# read the #letter#
oh if he knows the contents of this murmured he and that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ is the #father# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i am lost
$m_dantès$ waited expecting a #question# but in vain and he fixed his #eye# upon $edmond_dantès$ as if he would have penetrated his #thought#
oh it is impossible to #doubt# it cried he suddenly in heaven #name# cried the unhappy young #man# if you #doubt# me #question# me i #will# #answer# you
i am no longer able as i had hoped to restore you immediately to #liberty# before doing so i must consult the trial #justice# what my own #feeling# is you already know
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ made a violent #effort# and in a #tone# he strove to render firm #sir# said he
oh $monsieur_cavalcanti$ cried $m_dantès$ you have been rather a #friend# than a judge well i must detain you some #time# longer but i #will# strive to make it as short as possible
the principal charge against you is this #letter# and you see $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ approached the #fire# cast it in and waited until it was entirely consumed
you see i destroy it oh exclaimed $m_dantès$ you are goodness itself listen continued $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ you can now have confidence in me after what i have done
oh command and i #will# obey listen this is not a command but advice i give you
speak and i #will# follow your advice i shall detain you until this #evening# in the palais de #justice#
should #anyone# else interrogate you say to him what you have said to me but do not breathe a #word# of this #letter#
i #promise# it was $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who seemed to entreat and the #prisoner# who reassured him you see continued he glancing toward the grate where fragments of burnt #paper# fluttered in the flames
the #letter# is destroyed you and i alone know of its existence should you therefore be questioned deny all knowledge of it deny it boldly and you are saved
be satisfied i #will# deny it it was the only #letter# you had it was
swear it i swear it $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ rang a #police# agent entered $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ whispered some #word# in his ear to which the #officer# replied by a motion of his #head#
follow him said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ to $m_dantès$ dantès saluted $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and retired hardly had the #door# closed when $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ threw himself #half# fainting into a #chair#
alas alas murmured he if the #procureur# himself had been at marseilles i should have been ruined this accursed #letter# would have destroyed all my #hope#
suddenly a #light# passed over his #face# a #smile# played round his set mouth and his haggard #eye# were fixed in #thought#
oh my #father# must your past career always interfere with my successes this #will# do said he and from this #letter# which might have ruined me i #will# make my #fortune#
now to the #work# i have in #hand# and after having assured himself that the #prisoner# was gone the deputy #procureur# hastened to the $house_of_peers$ of his betrothed
the commissary of #police# as he traversed the antechamber made a #sign# to two gendarmes who placed themselves #one# on $m_dantès$ #right# and the #other# on his left
a #door# that communicated with the palais de #justice# was opened and they went through a long range of gloomy corridors whose #appearance# might have made even the boldest shudder
the palais de #justice# communicated with the #prison# a sombre edifice that from its grated #window# #look# on the clock tower of the accoules
the commissary took up an #iron# mallet and knocked thrice every blow seeming to $m_dantès$ as if struck on his #heart#
#chapter# the château if after numberless windings $m_dantès$ saw a #door# with an #iron# wicket the #door# opened the two gendarmes gently pushed him forward and the #door# closed with a loud #sound# behind him
he was conducted to a tolerably neat #chamber# but grated and barred and its #appearance# therefore did not greatly alarm him besides the #word# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who seemed to #interest# himself so much resounded still in his ears like a #promise# of freedom
the #air# he inhaled was no longer pure but thick and mephitic he was in #prison# it was four clock when $m_dantès$ was placed in this #chamber#
the obscurity augmented the acuteness of his hearing at the slightest #sound# he rose and hastened to the #door# convinced they were about to liberate him but the #sound# died away and $m_dantès$ sank again into his #seat#
at last about ten clock and just as $m_dantès$ began to #despair# #step# were heard in the corridor a key turned in the lock the bolts creaked the massy oaken #door# flew open and a flood of #light# from two torches pervaded the #apartment#
it was as we have said the st of march and the #prisoner# was soon buried in #darkness# by the torchlight $m_dantès$ saw the glittering sabres and carbines of four gendarmes
he had advanced at first but stopped at the #sight# of this display of force are you come to fetch me asked he
the conviction that they came from $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ relieved all $m_dantès$ apprehensions he advanced calmly and placed himself in the centre of the escort
yes replied a gendarme by the #order# of the deputy #procureur# i believe so a #carriage# waited at the #door# the coachman was on the #box# and a #police# #officer# sat beside him
$m_dantès$ was about to speak but #feeling# himself urged forward and having neither the #power# nor the intention to resist he mounted the #step# and was in an #instant# seated inside between two gendarmes the two #other# took their #place# opposite and the #carriage# rolled heavily over the #stone#
is this #carriage# for me said $m_dantès$ it is for you replied a gendarme the #prisoner# glanced at the #window# they were grated he had changed his #prison# for another that was conveying him
through the grating however $m_dantès$ saw they were passing through the rue caisserie and by the rue saint laurent and the rue taramis to the quay
the #carriage# stopped the #officer# descended approached the guardhouse a dozen #soldier# came out and formed themselves in #order# $m_dantès$ saw the reflection of their muskets by the #light# of the lamps on the quay
he knew not whither soon he saw the #light# of la consigne can all this force be summoned on my #account# #thought# he
the #officer# opened the #door# which was locked and without speaking a #word# answered $m_dantès$ #question# for he saw between the ranks of the #soldier# a passage formed from the #carriage# to the port
the two gendarmes who were opposite to him descended first then he was ordered to alight and the gendarmes on each #side# of him followed his example
they advanced towards a #boat# which a custom $house_of_peers$ #officer# held by a chain near the quay the #soldier# looked at $m_dantès$ with an #air# of stupid curiosity
in an #instant# he was placed in the stern sheets of the #boat# between the gendarmes while the #officer# stationed himself at the bow a shove sent the #boat# adrift and four sturdy oarsmen impelled it rapidly towards the pilon
at a shout from the #boat# the chain that closes the mouth of the port was lowered and in a second they were as $m_dantès$ knew in the frioul and outside the inner harbor
the #prisoner# first #feeling# was of #joy# at again breathing the pure #air# for #air# is freedom but he soon sighed for he passed before la réserve where he had that #morning# been so happy and now through the open #window# came the laughter and revelry of a ball
$m_dantès$ folded his #hand# raised his #eye# to heaven and prayed fervently the #boat# continued her voyage they had passed the tête de mort were now off the anse du pharo and about to double the battery
this manœuvre was incomprehensible to $m_dantès$ whither are you taking me asked he you #will# soon know
$m_dantès$ trained in discipline knew that #nothing# would be more absurd than to #question# subordinates who were forbidden to reply and so he remained silent
but still we are forbidden to give you any explanation the most vague and wild #thought# passed through his #mind#
the #boat# they were in could not make a long voyage there was no #vessel# at anchor outside the harbor he #thought# perhaps they were going to leave him on some distant #point#
besides had not the deputy who had been so kind to him told him that provided he did not pronounce the dreaded #name# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ he had #nothing# to apprehend
he was not bound nor had they made any attempt to handcuff him this seemed a good augury had not $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in his #presence# destroyed the fatal #letter# the only #proof# against him
they had left the ile ratonneau where the lighthouse stood on the #right# and were now opposite the #point# des catalans
it seemed to the #prisoner# that he could distinguish a feminine form on the beach for it was there $mercédès$ dwelt
he waited silently striving to pierce through the #darkness# how was it that a presentiment did not warn $mercédès$ that her lover was within three hundred yards of her
#one# #light# alone was visible and $m_dantès$ saw that it came from $mercédès$ #chamber# $mercédès$ was the only #one# awake in the whole settlement
a loud #cry# could be heard by her but pride restrained him and he did not utter it what would his guards think if they heard him shout like a madman
he remained silent his #eye# fixed upon the #light# the #boat# went on but the #prisoner# #thought# only of $mercédès$ an intervening elevation of land hid the #light#
while he had been absorbed in #thought# they had shipped their oars and hoisted sail the #boat# was now moving with the wind
in #spite# of his repugnance to address the guards $m_dantès$ turned to the nearest gendarme and taking his #hand# comrade said he
$m_dantès$ turned and perceived that they had got out to #sea# i adjure you as a christian and a #soldier# to tell me where we are going
i am #captain# $m_dantès$ a loyal frenchman #thought# accused of treason tell me where you are conducting me and i #promise# you on my #honor# i #will# submit to my fate
the gendarme looked irresolutely at his #companion# who returned for #answer# a #sign# that said i see no great harm in telling him now and the gendarme replied
you are a native of marseilles and a #sailor# and yet you do not know where you are going
on my #honor# i have no #idea# have you no #idea# whatever none at all that is impossible
your #order# do not forbid your telling me what i must know in ten #minute# in #half# an #hour# or an #hour#
i swear to you it is true tell me i entreat but my #order# you see i cannot escape even if i intended
unless you are blind or have never been outside the harbor you must know i do not
$m_dantès$ rose and looked forward when he saw rise within a hundred yards of him the black and frowning #rock# on which stands the château if
this gloomy fortress which has for more than three hundred #year# furnished food for so many wild legends seemed to $m_dantès$ like a scaffold to a malefactor
#look# round you then the château if cried he what are we going there for
the gendarme smiled i am not going there to be imprisoned said $m_dantès$ it is only used for political #prisoner#
i have committed no #crime# are there any #magistrate# or judges at the château if there are only said the gendarme a #governor# a garrison turnkeys and good thick #wall#
come come do not #look# so astonished or you #will# make me think you are laughing at me in #return# for my good #nature#
$m_dantès$ pressed the gendarme #hand# as though he would crush it you think then said he that i am taken to the château if to be imprisoned there
it is probable but there is no occasion to squeeze so hard without any inquiry without any formality
all the formalities have been gone through the inquiry is already made and so in #spite# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #promise#
i do not know what $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ promised you said the gendarme but i know we are taking you to the château if
by a rapid movement which the gendarme practiced #eye# had perceived $m_dantès$ sprang forward to precipitate himself into the #sea# but four vigorous #arm# seized him as his #foot# quitted the bottom of the #boat#
said the gendarme placing his knee on his chest this is the #way# you keep your #word# as a #sailor#
but what are you doing help comrades help he fell back cursing with rage good believe soft spoken #gentleman# again
hark ye my #friend# i have disobeyed my first #order# but i #will# not disobey the second and if you move i #will# blow your brains out
for a #moment# the #idea# of struggling crossed his #mind# and of so ending the unexpected evil that had overtaken him
but he bethought him of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #promise# and besides #death# in a #boat# from the #hand# of a gendarme seemed too terrible
and he levelled his carbine at $m_dantès$ who felt the muzzle against his temple he remained motionless but gnashing his teeth and wringing his #hand# with fury
#one# of the #sailor# leaped on shore a cord creaked as it ran through a pulley and $m_dantès$ guessed they were at the #end# of the voyage and that they were mooring the #boat#
his guards taking him by the #arm# and coat collar forced him to rise and dragged him towards the #step# that lead to the #gate# of the fortress while the #police# #officer# carrying a musket with fixed bayonet followed behind
$m_dantès$ made no resistance he was like a #man# in a #dream# he saw #soldier# drawn up on the embankment he knew vaguely that he was ascending a flight of #step# he was conscious that he passed through a #door# and that the #door# closed behind him but all this indistinctly as through a mist
at this #moment# the #boat# came to a landing with a violent shock he did not even see the ocean that terrible barrier against freedom which the #prisoner# #look# upon with utter #despair#
he looked around he was in a #court# surrounded by high #wall# he heard the measured tread of sentinels and as they passed before the #light# he saw the barrels of their muskets shine
they halted for a #minute# during which he strove to collect his #thought# they waited upwards of ten #minute# certain $m_dantès$ could not escape the gendarmes released him
they seemed awaiting #order# the #order# came where is the #prisoner# said a #voice# here replied the gendarmes
the #prisoner# followed his guide who led him into a #room# almost under #ground# whose bare and reeking #wall# seemed as though impregnated with #tear# a lamp placed on a stool illumined the #apartment# faintly and showed $m_dantès$ the #feature# of his conductor an under #jailer# ill clothed and of sullen #appearance#
let him follow me i #will# take him to his cell go said the gendarmes thrusting $m_dantès$ forward
here is your #chamber# for tonight said he it is late and the #governor# is asleep #tomorrow# perhaps he may change you
in the meantime there is bread #water# and fresh straw and that is all a #prisoner# can #wish# for goodnight
and before $m_dantès$ could open his mouth before he had noticed where the #jailer# placed his bread or the #water# before he had glanced towards the #corner# where the straw was the #jailer# disappeared taking with him the lamp and closing the #door# leaving stamped upon the #prisoner#
#mind# the dim reflection of the dripping #wall# of his dungeon $m_dantès$ was alone in #darkness# and in #silence# cold as the #shadow# that he felt breathe on his burning #forehead#
with the first dawn of #day# the #jailer# returned with #order# to leave $m_dantès$ where he was he found the #prisoner# in the same #position# as if fixed there his #eye# swollen with weeping
he had passed the #night# standing and without sleep the #jailer# advanced $m_dantès$ appeared not to perceive him he touched him on the #shoulder#
$edmond_dantès$ started have you not slept said the #jailer# i do not know replied $m_dantès$ the #jailer# stared
are you hungry continued he i do not know do you #wish# for #anything# i #wish# to see the #governor#
the #jailer# shrugged his #shoulder# and left the #chamber# $m_dantès$ followed him with his #eye# and stretched forth his #hand# towards the open #door# but the #door# closed
all his #emotion# then burst forth he cast himself on the #ground# weeping bitterly and asking himself what #crime# he had committed that he was thus punished
the #day# passed thus he scarcely tasted food but walked round and round the cell like a wild beast in its cage
#one# #thought# in particular tormented him namely that during his journey hither he had sat so still whereas he might a dozen #time# have plunged into the #sea# and #thank# to his #power# of swimming for which he was famous have gained the shore concealed himself until the arrival of a genoese or spanish #vessel# escaped to spain or italy where $mercédès$ and his #father# could have joined him
he spoke italian like a tuscan and spanish like a castilian he would have been free and happy with $mercédès$ and his #father# whereas he was now confined in the château if that impregnable fortress ignorant of the future destiny of his #father# and $mercédès$ and all this because he had trusted to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #promise#
he had no #fear# as to how he should live good seamen are welcome everywhere the #thought# was maddening and $m_dantès$ threw himself furiously down on his straw
the next #morning# at the same #hour# the #jailer# came again well said the #jailer# are you more reasonable #today#
$m_dantès$ made no reply come cheer up is there #anything# that i can do for you i #wish# to see the #governor#
i have already told you it was impossible why so because it is against #prison# rules and #prisoner# must not even ask for it
what is allowed then better fare if you pay for it books and leave to walk about
i do not want books i am satisfied with my food and do not #care# to walk about but i #wish# to see the #governor#
if you worry me by repeating the same #thing# i #will# not bring you any more to eat
the #jailer# saw by his #tone# he would be happy to die and as every #prisoner# is worth ten sous a #day# to his #jailer# he replied in a more subdued #tone#
what you ask is impossible but if you are very well behaved you #will# be allowed to walk about and some #day# you #will# meet the #governor# and if he chooses to reply that is his #affair#
well then said $edmond_dantès$ if you do not i shall die of hunger that is all
but asked $m_dantès$ how long shall i have to wait ah a #month# six #month# a #year#
it is too long a #time# i #wish# to see him at once ah said the #jailer# do not always brood over what is impossible or you #will# be mad in a fortnight
yes we have an instance here it was by always offering a #million# of #franc# to the #governor# for his #liberty# that an #abbé# became mad who was in this #chamber# before you
you think so how long has he left it two #year# was he liberated then
no he was put in a dungeon listen said $m_dantès$ i am not an #abbé# i am not mad perhaps i shall be but at present unfortunately i am not
i do not offer you a #million# because i have it not but i #will# give you a hundred crowns if the first #time# you go to marseilles you #will# seek out a young #girl# named $mercédès$ at the catalans and give her two #line# from me
if i took them and were detected i should lose my #place# which is worth two thousand #franc# a #year# so that i should be a great fool to run such a risk for three hundred
i #will# make you another offer what is that well said $m_dantès$ mark this if you refuse at least to tell $mercédès$
i am here i #will# some #day# hide myself behind the #door# and when you enter i #will# dash out your brains with this stool
the #abbé# began like you and in three #day# you #will# be like him mad enough to tie up but fortunately there are dungeons here
threats cried the #jailer# retreating and putting himself on the defensive you are certainly going mad $m_dantès$ whirled the stool round his #head#
all #right# all #right# said the #jailer# all #right# since you #will# have it so i #will# send #word# to the #governor#
very well returned $m_dantès$ dropping the stool and sitting on it as if he were in reality mad the #jailer# went out and returned in an #instant# with a corporal and four #soldier#
by the #governor# #order# said he conduct the #prisoner# to the tier beneath to the dungeon then said the corporal
yes we must put the madman with the madmen the #soldier# seized $m_dantès$ who followed passively he descended fifteen #step# and the #door# of a dungeon was opened and he was thrust in
the #door# closed and $m_dantès$ advanced with outstretched #hand# until he touched the #wall# he then sat down in the #corner# until his #eye# became accustomed to the #darkness#
the #evening# of the betrothal $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had as we have said hastened back to $madame_de_saint_méran$ in the #place# du grand cours and on entering the $house_of_peers$ found that the #guest# whom he had left at #table# were taking coffee in the salon
$renée$ was with all the #rest# of the company anxiously awaiting him and his entrance was followed by a general exclamation
the #jailer# was #right# $m_dantès$ wanted but little of being utterly mad #chapter# well decapitator guardian of the state royalist brutus what is the #matter# said #one#
speak out are we threatened with a fresh reign of #terror# asked another has the corsican ogre broken loose cried a third
marquise said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ approaching his future #mother# in #law# i request your pardon for thus leaving you #will# the marquis #honor# me by a few #moment# private #conversation#
ah it is really a serious #matter# then asked the marquis remarking the cloud on $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #brow#
so serious that i must take leave of you for a few #day# so added he turning to $renée$ judge for yourself if it be not important
you are going to leave us cried $renée$ unable to hide her #emotion# at this unexpected announcement
that #madame# is an official #secret# but if you have any commissions for paris a #friend# of mine is going there tonight and #will# with #pleasure# undertake them
alas returned $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i must where then are you going asked the marquise the #guest# looked at each #other#
you #wish# to speak to me alone said the marquis yes let us go to the library please
the marquis took his #arm# and they left the salon well asked he as soon as they were by themselves tell me what it is
an #affair# of the greatest importance that demands my immediate #presence# in paris now excuse the indiscretion marquis but have you any landed property
all my #fortune# is in the funds seven or eight hundred thousand #franc# then sell out sell out marquis or you #will# lose it all
but how can i sell out here you have a broker have you not yes
then give me a #letter# to him and tell him to sell out without an #instant# delay perhaps even now i shall arrive too late
the deuce you say replied the marquis let us lose no #time# then and sitting down he wrote a #letter# to his broker ordering him to sell out at the market price
now then said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ placing the #letter# in his pocketbook i must have another to whom to the #king#
to the #king# yes i dare not write to his majesty i do not ask you to write to his majesty but ask de salvieux to do so
i want a #letter# that #will# enable me to reach the #king# #presence# without all the formalities of demanding an audience that would occasion a loss of precious #time#
but address yourself to the keeper of the seals he has the #right# of entry at the tuileries and can procure you audience at any #hour# of the #day# or #night#
doubtless but there is no occasion to divide the #honor# of my discovery with him the keeper would leave me in the background and take all the glory to himself
i tell you marquis my #fortune# is made if i only reach the tuileries the first for the #king# #will# not forget the #service# i do him
in that #case# go and get ready i #will# call salvieux and make him write the #letter# be as quick as possible i must be on the #road# in a #quarter# of an #hour#
you #will# present my excuses to the marquise and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $renée$ whom i leave on such a #day# with great regret
tell your coachman to stop at the #door# you #will# find them both here and can make your farewells in #person#
a thousand #thank# and now for the #letter# the marquis rang a #servant# entered say to the comte de salvieux that i would like to see him
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ hastily quitted the #apartment# but reflecting that the #sight# of the deputy #procureur# running through the #street# would be enough to throw the whole city into confusion he resumed his ordinary pace
now then go said the marquis i shall be gone only a few #moment# at his #door# he perceived a figure in the #shadow# that seemed to wait for him
it was $mercédès$ who hearing no news of her lover had come unobserved to inquire after him as $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ drew near she advanced and stood before him
her beauty and high bearing surprised him and when she inquired what had become of her lover it seemed to him that she was the judge and he the accused
the young #man# you speak of said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ abruptly is a great criminal and i can do #nothing# for him $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
$m_dantès$ had spoken of $mercédès$ and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ instantly recognized her $mercédès$ burst into #tear# and as $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ strove to pass her again addressed him
but at least tell me where he is that i may know whether he is alive or dead said she
and desirous of putting an #end# to the interview he pushed by her and closed the #door# as if to exclude the pain he felt
but remorse is not thus banished like virgil wounded hero he carried the arrow in his wound and arrived at the salon $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ uttered a sigh that was almost a sob and sank into a #chair#
i do not know he is no longer in my #hand# replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ then the first pangs of an unending torture seized upon his #heart#
the #man# he sacrificed to his ambition that innocent victim immolated on the altar of his #father# faults appeared to him pale and threatening leading his affianced bride by the #hand# and bringing with him remorse not such as the ancients figured furious and terrible but that slow and consuming agony whose pangs are intensified from #hour# to #hour# up to the very #moment# of #death#
he had frequently called for capital punishment on criminals and owing to his irresistible eloquence they had been condemned and yet the slightest #shadow# of remorse had never clouded $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #brow# because they were guilty at least he believed so but here was an innocent #man# whose #happiness# he had destroyed
as he thus reflected he felt the sensation we have described and which had hitherto been unknown to him arise in his bosom and fill him with vague apprehensions
it is thus that a wounded #man# trembles instinctively at the approach of the #finger# to his wound until it be healed but $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was #one# of those that never close or if they do only close to reopen more agonizing than ever
if at this #moment# the sweet #voice# of $renée$ had sounded in his ears pleading for mercy or the fair $mercédès$ had entered and said
in the #name# of god i conjure you to restore me my affianced #husband# his cold and trembling #hand# would have signed his release but no #voice# broke the stillness of the #chamber# and the #door# was opened only by $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #valet# who came to tell him that the travelling #carriage# was in readiness
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ rose or rather sprang from his #chair# hastily opened #one# of the drawers of his desk emptied all the #gold# it contained into his #pocket# stood motionless an #instant# his #hand# pressed to his #head# muttered a few inarticulate #sound# and then perceiving that his #servant# had placed his cloak on his #shoulder# he sprang into the #carriage# ordering the postilions to drive to de $madame_de_saint_méran$
then he had a #moment# hesitation in this #case# he was not the judge but the executioner the hapless $m_dantès$ was doomed
as the marquis had promised $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ found the marquise and $renée$ in waiting he started when he saw $renée$ for he fancied she was again about to plead for $m_dantès$
alas her #emotion# were wholly personal she was thinking only of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ departure she loved $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and he left her at the #moment# he was about to become her #husband#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ knew not when he should #return# and $renée$ far from pleading for $m_dantès$ hated the #man# whose #crime# separated her from her lover
she had met $m_fernand_mondego$ at the #corner# of the rue de la loge she had returned to the catalans and had despairingly cast herself on her couch
meanwhile what of $mercédès$ $m_fernand_mondego$ kneeling by her #side# took her #hand# and covered it with kisses that $mercédès$ did not even feel
the lamp went out for want of oil but she paid no heed to the #darkness# and dawn came but she knew not that it was #day#
she passed the #night# thus #grief# had made her blind to all but #one# object that was $edmond_dantès$ ah you are there said she at #length# turning towards $m_fernand_mondego$
he had learned that $m_dantès$ had been taken to #prison# and he had gone to all his #friend# and the influential #person# of the city but the report was already in circulation that $m_dantès$ was arrested as a bonapartist agent and as the most sanguine looked upon any attempt of $napoleon$ to remount the throne as impossible he met with #nothing# but refusal and had returned home in #despair# declaring that the #matter# was serious and that #nothing# more could be done
$m_caderousse$ was equally restless and uneasy but instead of seeking like $m_maximilian_morrel$ to aid $m_dantès$ he had shut himself up with two bottles of black currant brandy in the #hope# of drowning reflection
but he did not succeed and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink and yet not so intoxicated as to forget what had happened
with his elbows on the #table# he sat between the two empty bottles while spectres danced in the #light# of the unsnuffed candle spectres such as hoffmann strews over his punch drenched pages like black fantastic dust
i have not quitted you since #yesterday# returned $m_fernand_mondego$ sorrowfully $m_maximilian_morrel$ had not readily given up the fight $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ alone was content and joyous
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was #one# of those #man# born with a pen behind the ear and an inkstand in #place# of a #heart#
he had got rid of an #enemy# and made his own situation on the $pharaon$ secure #everything# with him was multiplication or subtraction
the #life# of a #man# was to him of far less value than a numeral especially when by taking it away he could increase the #sum# total of his own #desire#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ after having received de salvieux #letter# embraced $renée$ kissed the marquise #hand# and shaken that of the marquis started for paris along the aix #road#
he went to #bed# at his usual #hour# and slept in peace old $m_dantès$ was dying with anxiety to know what had become of $edmond_dantès$
we #will# leave $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ on the #road# to paris travelling #thank# to trebled fees with all speed and passing through two or three #apartment# enter at the tuileries the little #room# with the arched #window# so well known as having been the favorite closet of $napoleon$ and $louis_xviii$ and now of $louis_xviii$ philippe
there seated before a walnut #table# he had brought with him from hartwell and to which from #one# of those fancies not uncommon to great #people# he was particularly attached the #king# $louis_xviii$ was carelessly listening to a #man# of fifty or fifty two #year# of #age# with gray #hair# aristocratic bearing and exceedingly gentlemanly attire and meanwhile making a marginal #note# in a volume of gryphius rather inaccurate but much sought after edition of horace a #work# which was much indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical monarch
but we know very well what had become of $edmond_dantès$ #chapter# the #king# closet at the tuileries you say #sir# said the #king#
that i am exceedingly disquieted sire really have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven lean kine
no sire for that would only betoken for us seven #year# of plenty and seven #year# of scarcity and with a #king# as full of foresight as your majesty scarcity is not a #thing# to be feared
then of what #other# scourge are you afraid my dear $m_de_blacas$ sire i have every #reason# to believe that a storm is brewing in the south
i think you are wrongly informed and know positively that on the #contrary# it is very fine weather in that direction
well my dear duke replied $louis_xviii$ #man# of ability as he was $louis_xviii$ liked a pleasant jest
if it only be to reassure a faithful #servant# #will# your majesty send into languedoc provence and dauphiné trusty #man# who #will# bring you back a faithful report as to the #feeling# in these three provinces
sire continued $m_de_blacas$ canimus surdis replied the #king# continuing the annotations in his horace
sire replied the courtier laughing in #order# that he might seem to comprehend the quotation your majesty may be perfectly #right# in relying on the good #feeling# of france but i #fear# i am not altogether wrong in dreading some desperate attempt
by whom by $bonaparte$ or at least by his adherents my dear $m_de_blacas$ said the #king#
you with your alarms prevent me from working and you sire prevent me from sleeping with your security
wait my dear #sir# wait a #moment# for i have such a delightful #note# on the pastor quum traheret wait and i #will# listen to you afterwards
wrote in a #hand# as small as possible another #note# on the margin of his horace and then looking at the duke with the #air# of a #man# who thinks he has an #idea# of his own while he is only commenting upon the #idea# of another said go on my dear duke go on
there was a brief pause during which $louis_xviii$ i listen sire said $m_de_blacas$ who had for a #moment# the #hope# of sacrificing $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ to his own profit
i am compelled to tell you that these are not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet me but a serious minded #man# deserving all my confidence and charged by me to watch over the south the duke hesitated as he pronounced these #word#
has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril threatens the #king# and so i hastened to you sire
mala ducis avi domum continued $louis_xviii$ still annotating does your majesty #wish# me to drop the #subject#
by no #mean# my dear duke but just stretch out your #hand# which whichever you please there to the left
here sire i tell you to the left and you are looking to the #right# i #mean# on my left
yes there you #will# find #yesterday# report of the #minister# of #police# but here is dandré himself and dandré announced by the chamberlain in waiting entered
with repressed #smile# come in #baron# and tell the duke all you know the latest news of de $bonaparte$ do not conceal #anything# however serious let us see the #island# of $elba$ is a volcano and we may expect to have issuing thence flaming and bristling war bella horrida bella
dandré leaned very respectfully on the back of a #chair# with his two #hand# and said has your majesty perused #yesterday# report
yes yes but tell the duke himself who cannot find #anything# what the report contains give him the particulars of what the usurper is doing in his islet
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ said the #baron# to the duke all the #servant# of his majesty must approve of the latest intelligence which we have from the #island# of $elba$
come in said $louis_xviii$ $bonaparte$ dandré looked at $louis_xviii$ who employed in writing a #note# did not even raise his #head#
$bonaparte$ continued the #baron# is mortally wearied and passes whole #day# in watching his miners at #work# at porto longone
and scratches himself for amusement added the #king# scratches himself inquired the duke what does your majesty #mean#
did you forget that this great #man# this hero this demigod is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries him to #death# prurigo
yes indeed my dear duke and moreover my dear duke continued the #minister# of #police# we are almost assured that in a very short #time# the usurper #will# be insane
sometimes he weeps bitterly sometimes laughs boisterously at #other# #time# he passes #hour# on the seashore flinging #stone# in the #water# and when the flint makes duck and drake five or six #time# he appears as delighted as if he had gained another marengo or austerlitz
insane raving mad his #head# becomes weaker now you must agree that these are indubitable symptoms of insanity
or of wisdom my dear #baron# or of wisdom said $louis_xviii$ laughing the greatest #captain# of antiquity amused themselves by casting pebbles into the ocean see plutarch #life# of scipio africanus
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who did not choose to reveal the whole #secret# lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure had yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness
$m_de_blacas$ pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the truthful #minister# well well dandré said $louis_xviii$
$m_de_blacas$ is not yet convinced let us proceed therefore to the usurper conversion the #minister# of #police# bowed
the usurper conversion murmured the duke looking at the #king# and dandré who spoke alternately like virgil shepherds the usurper converted
decidedly my dear duke in what #way# converted to good principles tell him all about it #baron#
$napoleon$ lately had a review and as two or three of his old veterans expressed a #desire# to #return# to france he gave them their dismissal and exhorted them to serve the good #king#
why this is the #way# of it said the #minister# with the gravest #air# in the #world#
well $m_de_blacas$ what think you of this inquired the #king# triumphantly and pausing for a #moment# from the voluminous scholiast before him
i say sire that the #minister# of #police# is greatly deceived or i am and as it is impossible it can be the #minister# of #police# as he has the guardianship of the safety and #honor# of your majesty it is probable that i am in error
however sire if i might advise your majesty #will# interrogate the #person# of whom i spoke to you and i #will# urge your majesty to do him this #honor#
most willingly duke under your auspices i #will# receive any #person# you please but you must not expect me to be too confiding
these were his own #word# of that i am certain #baron# have you any report more recent than this dated the th february and this is the rd of march
no sire but i am hourly expecting #one# it may have arrived since i left my office go thither and if there be none
well well continued $louis_xviii$ make #one# that is the usual #way# is it not and the #king# laughed facetiously
we have no occasion to invent any every #day# our desks are loaded with most circumstantial denunciations coming from hosts of #people# who #hope# for some #return# for #service# which they seek to render but cannot they trust to #fortune# and rely upon some unexpected #event# in some #way# to justify their predictions
oh sire replied the #minister# well #sir# go said $louis_xviii$ and remember that i am waiting for you
i #will# but go and #return# sire i shall be back in ten #minute# and i sire said $m_de_blacas$ #will# go and find my messenger
really $m_de_blacas$ i must change your armorial bearings i #will# give you an eagle with outstretched wings holding in its claws a prey which tries in vain to escape and bearing this device tenax
wait #sir# wait said $louis_xviii$ sire i listen said $m_de_blacas$ biting his nails with impatience
i #wish# to consult you on this passage molli fugiens anhelitu you know it refers to a stag flying from a wolf
admirable sire but my messenger is like the stag you refer to for he has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three #day#
are you not a sportsman and a great wolf hunter well then what do you think of the molli anhelitu
which is undergoing great fatigue and anxiety my dear duke when we have a telegraph which transmits messages in three or four #hour# and that without getting in the least out of breath
ah sire you recompense but badly this poor young #man# who has come so far and with so much ardor to give your majesty useful information
if only for the sake of de salvieux who recommends him to me i entreat your majesty to receive him graciously
de salvieux my #brother# chamberlain yes sire he is at marseilles
and writes me thence does he speak to you of this conspiracy no but strongly recommends $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and begs me to present him to your majesty
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ cried the #king# is the messenger #name# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ yes sire and he comes from marseilles
in #person# why did you not mention his #name# at once replied the #king# betraying some uneasiness
sire i #thought# his #name# was unknown to your majesty no no $m_de_blacas$ he is a #man# of strong and elevated understanding ambitious too and $pardieu$
you know his #father# #name# his #father# yes $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ noirtier the girondin $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the senator he himself
and your majesty has employed the #son# of such a #man# $m_de_blacas$ my #friend# you have but limited comprehension
i told you $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was ambitious and to attain this ambition $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ would sacrifice #everything# even his #father# then sire may i present him
this #instant# duke where is he waiting below in my #carriage# seek him at once i hasten to do so
the duke left the royal #presence# with the speed of a young #man# his really sincere royalism made him youthful again
$louis_xviii$ remained alone and turning his #eye# on his #half# opened horace muttered justum et tenacem propositi virum
$m_de_blacas$ returned as speedily as he had departed but in the antechamber he was forced to appeal to the #king#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ dusty garb his #costume# which was not of courtly cut excited the susceptibility of de brezé who was all #astonishment# at finding that this young #man# had the audacity to enter before the #king# in such attire
his majesty #order# and in #spite# of the protestations which the #master# of ceremonies made for the #honor# of his office and principles $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was introduced
authority the duke however overcame all difficulties with a #word# the #king# was seated in the same #place# where the duke had left him
on #opening# the #door# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ found himself facing him and the young #magistrate# first impulse was to pause come in $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ said the #king# come in
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ bowed and advancing a few #step# waited until the #king# should interrogate him $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ said $louis_xviii$
the duc $m_de_blacas$ assures me you have some interesting information to communicate sire the duke is #right# and i believe your majesty #will# think it equally important
in the first #place# and before #everything# else #sir# is the news as bad in your #opinion# as i am asked to believe
sire i believe it to be most urgent but i #hope# by the speed i have used that it is not irreparable
speak as fully as you please #sir# said the #king# who began to give #way# to the #emotion# which had showed itself in $m_de_blacas$ #face# and affected $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #voice#
sire said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i #will# render a faithful report to your majesty but i must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads to some obscurity in my language
speak #sir# and pray begin at the beginning i like #order# in #everything#
a #glance# at the #king# after this discreet and subtle exordium assured $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ of the benignity of his august auditor and he went on
sire i have come as rapidly to paris as possible to inform your majesty that i have discovered in the exercise of my #duty# not a commonplace and insignificant plot such as is every #day# got up in the lower ranks of the #people# and in the army but an actual conspiracy a storm which menaces no less than your majesty throne
sire the usurper is arming three ships he meditates some project which however mad is yet perhaps terrible at this #moment# he #will# have left $elba$ to go whither
i know not but assuredly to attempt a landing either at naples or on the coast of tuscany or perhaps on the shores of france
your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the #island# of $elba$ has maintained his relations with italy and france
i am #sir# said the #king# much agitated and recently we have had information that the bonapartist clubs have had meetings in the rue saint jacques
sire they are the results of an examination which i have made of a #man# of marseilles whom i have watched for some #time# and arrested on the #day# of my departure
this #person# a #sailor# of turbulent character and whom i suspected of bonapartism has been secretly to the #island# of $elba$
there he saw the grand marshal who charged him with an oral message to a bonapartist in paris whose #name# i could not extract from him but this mission was to prepare #man# #mind# for a #return# it is the #man# who says this
but proceed i beg of you how did you obtain these details sire a #return# which #will# soon occur
so serious sire that when the #circumstance# surprised me in the midst of a #family# festival on the very #day# of my betrothal i left my bride and #friend# postponing #everything# that i might hasten to lay at your majesty #foot# the #fear# which impressed me and the assurance of my devotion
and where is this #man# in #prison# sire and the #matter# seems serious to you
true said $louis_xviii$ was there not a #marriage# engagement between you and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ de $madame_de_saint_méran$ #daughter# of #one# of your majesty most faithful #servant#
yes yes but let us talk of this plot $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ sire i #fear# it is more than a plot i #fear# it is a conspiracy
smiling is a #thing# very easy to meditate but more difficult to conduct to an #end# inasmuch as re established so recently on the throne of our ancestors we have our #eye# open at once upon the past the present and the future
a conspiracy in these #time# said $louis_xviii$ for the last ten #month# my #minister# have redoubled their vigilance in #order# to watch the shore of the mediterranean
if $bonaparte$ landed at naples the whole coalition would be on #foot# before he could even reach piombino if he land in tuscany he #will# be in an unfriendly territory if he land in france it must be with a handful of #man# and the result of that is easily foretold execrated as he is by the population
take courage #sir# but at the same #time# rely on our royal gratitude ah here is dandré cried $m_de_blacas$
at this #instant# the #minister# of #police# appeared at the #door# pale trembling and as if ready to faint $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was about to retire but $m_de_blacas$ taking his #hand# restrained him
#chapter# the corsican ogre at the #sight# of this agitation $louis_xviii$ pushed from him violently the #table# at which he was sitting
has your uneasiness #anything# to do with what $m_de_blacas$ has told me and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ has just confirmed
$m_de_blacas$ moved suddenly towards the #baron# but the fright of the courtier pleaded for the forbearance of the statesman and besides as #matter# were it was much more to his advantage that the prefect of #police# should triumph over him than that he should humiliate the prefect
what ails you #baron# he exclaimed you appear quite aghast sire stammered the #baron# well what is it asked $louis_xviii$
the #minister# of #police# giving #way# to an impulse of #despair# was about to throw himself at the #foot# of $louis_xviii$ who retreated a #step# and frowned
#will# you speak he said oh sire what a dreadful #misfortune# i am indeed to be pitied i can never forgive myself
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ said $louis_xviii$ i command you to speak well sire the usurper left $elba$ on the th february and landed on the st of march
and where in italy asked the #king# eagerly in france sire at a small port near antibes in the gulf of juan
the usurper landed in france near antibes in the gulf of juan two hundred and fifty leagues from paris on the st of march and you only acquired this information #today# the rd of march
well #sir# what you tell me is impossible you must have received a false report or you have gone mad
$louis_xviii$ made a gesture of indescribable anger and alarm and then drew himself up as if this sudden blow had struck him at the same #moment# in #heart# and #countenance#
alas sire it is but too true in france he cried the usurper in france then they did not watch over this #man#
who knows they were perhaps in league with him oh sire exclaimed the duc $m_de_blacas$ dandré is not a #man# to be accused of treason
sire we have all been blind and the #minister# of #police# has shared the general blindness that is all but said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and then suddenly checking himself he was silent then he continued
your pardon sire he said bowing my zeal carried me away #will# your majesty deign to excuse me speak #sir# speak boldly replied $louis_xviii$
sire said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the usurper is detested in the south and it seems to me that if he ventured into the south it would be easy to raise languedoc and provence against him
you alone forewarned us of the evil now try and aid us with the remedy yes assuredly replied the #minister#
but he is advancing by gap and sisteron advancing he is advancing said $louis_xviii$ is he then advancing on paris
the #minister# of #police# maintained a #silence# which was equivalent to a complete avowal and dauphiné #sir# inquired the #king# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
sire i am sorry to tell your majesty a cruel #fact# but the #feeling# in dauphiné is quite the reverse of that in provence or languedoc
do you think it possible to rouse that as well as provence the mountaineers are bonapartists sire
then murmured $louis_xviii$ he was well informed and how many #man# had he with him i do not know sire answered the #minister# of #police#
what you do not know have you neglected to obtain information on that #point# of #course# it is of no consequence he added with a withering #smile#
sire it was impossible to learn the despatch simply stated the #fact# of the landing and the route taken by the usurper
and how did this despatch reach you inquired the #king# the #minister# bowed his #head# and while a deep color overspread his cheeks he stammered out
by the telegraph sire $louis_xviii$ advanced a #step# and folded his #arm# over his chest as $napoleon$ would have done
so then he exclaimed turning pale with anger seven conjoined and allied armies overthrew that #man# a miracle of heaven replaced me on the throne of my #father# after five and twenty #year# of exile
i have during those five and twenty #year# spared no pains to understand the #people# of france and the #interest# which were confided to me and now when i see the fruition of my #wish# almost within reach the #power# i hold in my #hand# bursts and shatters me to atoms
murmured the #minister# #feeling# that the pressure of #circumstance# however #light# a #thing# to destiny was too much for any human #strength# to endure
sire it is fatality what our #enemy# say of us is then true we have learnt #nothing# forgotten #nothing#
if i were betrayed as he was i would console myself but to be in the midst of #person# elevated by myself to #place# of #honor# who ought to watch over me more carefully than over themselves for my #fortune#
is theirs before me they were #nothing# after me they #will# be #nothing# and perish miserably from incapacity ineptitude oh yes #sir# you are #right#
it is fatality the #minister# quailed before this outburst of sarcasm $m_de_blacas$ wiped the moisture from his #brow#
to fall continued #king# $louis_xviii$ who at the first #glance# had sounded the abyss on which the monarchy hung suspended to fall and learn of that fall by telegraph
oh i would rather mount the scaffold of my #brother# $louis_xviii$ xvi than thus descend the #staircase# at the tuileries driven away by ridicule
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ smiled within himself for he felt his increased importance ridicule #sir# why you know not its #power# in france and yet you ought to know it
approach $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ resumed the #king# addressing the young #man# who motionless and breathless was listening to a #conversation# on which depended the destiny of a kingdom
sire sire murmured the #minister# for #pity# approach and tell $monsieur_cavalcanti$ that it is possible to know beforehand all that he has not known
sire it was really impossible to learn #secret# which that #man# concealed from all the #world# really impossible
yes that is a great #word# #sir# unfortunately there are great #word# as there are great #man# i have measured them
really impossible for a #minister# who has an office agents spies and fifteen hundred thousand #franc# for #secret# #service# #money# to know what is going on at sixty leagues from the coast of france
well then see here is a #gentleman# who had none of these resources at his disposal a #gentleman# only a simple #magistrate# who learned more than you with all your #police# and who would have saved my crown if like you he had the #power# of directing a telegraph
the #look# of the #minister# of #police# was turned with concentrated #spite# on $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who bent his #head# in modest triumph
i do not #mean# that for you $m_de_blacas$ continued $louis_xviii$ for if you have discovered #nothing# at least you have had the good sense to persevere in your suspicions
any #other# than yourself would have considered the disclosure of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ insignificant or else dictated by venal ambition
these #word# were an allusion to the sentiments which the #minister# of #police# had uttered with so much confidence an #hour# before
any #other# #person# would perhaps have been overcome by such an intoxicating draught of praise but he feared to make for himself a mortal #enemy# of the #police# #minister# although he saw that dandré was irrevocably lost
in #fact# the #minister# who in the plenitude of his #power# had been unable to unearth $napoleon$ #secret# might in #despair# at his own downfall interrogate $m_dantès$ and so lay bare the motives of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ plot
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ understood the #king# intent realizing this $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ came to the rescue of the crest fallen #minister# instead of aiding to crush him
sire said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the suddenness of this #event# must prove to your majesty that the issue is in the #hand# of providence what your majesty is pleased to attribute to me as profound perspicacity is simply owing to #chance# and i have profited by that #chance# like a good and devoted #servant# that all
do not attribute to me more than i deserve sire that your majesty may never have occasion to recall the first #opinion# you have been pleased to form of me
the #minister# of #police# thanked the young #man# by an eloquent #look# and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ understood that he had succeeded in his design that is to say that without forfeiting the gratitude of the #king# he had made a #friend# of #one# on whom in #case# of necessity he might rely
tis well resumed the #king# and now #gentleman# he continued turning towards $m_de_blacas$ and the #minister# of #police#
i have no further occasion for you and you may retire what now remains to do is in the department of the #minister# of war
fortunately sire said $m_de_blacas$ we can rely on the army your majesty knows how every report confirms their loyalty and attachment
do not mention reports duke to me for i know now what confidence to #place# in them yet speaking of reports #baron# what have you learned with regard to the #affair# in the rue saint jacques
your pardon sire but my devotion to your majesty has made me forget not the respect i have for that is too deeply engraved in my #heart# but the rules of etiquette
the #affair# in the rue saint jacques exclaimed $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ unable to repress an exclamation then suddenly pausing he added
go on go on #sir# replied the #king# you have #today# earned the #right# to make inquiries here sire interposed the #minister# of #police#
i came a #moment# ago to give your majesty fresh information which i had obtained on this #head# when your majesty #attention# was attracted by the terrible #event# that has occurred in the gulf and now these #fact# #will# cease to #interest# your majesty
this #affair# seems to me to have a decided connection with that which occupies our #attention# and the #death# of general $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #will# perhaps put us on the direct track of a great internal conspiracy
on the #contrary# #sir# on the #contrary# said $louis_xviii$ at the #name# of general $m_franz_de_quesnel$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ trembled
#everything# #point# to the conclusion sire said the #minister# of #police# that #death# was not the result of suicide as we first believed but of assassination
an unknown #person# had been with him that #morning# and made an appointment with him in the rue saint jacques unfortunately the general #valet# who was dressing his #hair# at the #moment# when the #stranger# entered heard the #street# mentioned but did not catch the number
as the #police# #minister# related this to the #king# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who looked as if his very #life# hung on the speaker #lip# turned alternately red and pale
general $m_franz_de_quesnel$ it appears had just left a bonapartist club when he disappeared the #king# looked towards him
do you not think with me $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ that general $m_franz_de_quesnel$ whom they believed attached to the usurper but who was really entirely devoted to me has perished the victim of a bonapartist ambush
it is probable sire replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ but is this all that is known they are on the track of the #man# who appointed the meeting with him
he is a #man# of from fifty to fifty two #year# of #age# dark with black #eye# covered with shaggy eyebrows and a thick moustache
he was dressed in a blue frock coat buttoned up to the chin and wore at his button hole the rosette of an #officer# of the legion of #honor#
#yesterday# a #person# exactly corresponding with this description was followed but he was lost #sight# of at the #corner# of the rue de la jussienne and the rue coq héron
on his track said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ yes the #servant# has given his description $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ leaned on the back of an armchair for as the #minister# of #police# went on speaking
he felt his legs bend under him but when he learned that the unknown had escaped the vigilance of the agent who followed him he breathed again
for if as i am all but convinced general $m_franz_de_quesnel$ who would have been so useful to us at this #moment# has been murdered his assassins bonapartists or not shall be cruelly punished
continue to seek for this #man# #sir# said the #king# to the #minister# of #police# it required all $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ coolness not to betray the #terror# with which this declaration of the #king# inspired him
how strange continued the #king# with some asperity the #police# think that they have disposed of the whole #matter# when they say
a murder has been committed and especially so when they can add and we are on the track of the guilty #person#
i #will# no longer detain you $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ for you must be fatigued after so long a journey go and #rest#
sire your majesty #will# i trust be amply satisfied on this #point# at least we shall see of #course# you stopped at your #father#
a #feeling# of faintness came over $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ no sire he replied i alighted at the hotel de madrid in the rue de tournon
but you have seen him sire i went straight to the duc $m_de_blacas$ but you #will# see him then
ah i forgot said $louis_xviii$ smiling in a #manner# which proved that all these #question# were not made without a motive i forgot you and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ are not on the best terms possible and that is another sacrifice made to the royal cause and for which you should be recompensed
sire the kindness your majesty deigns to evince towards me is a recompense which so far surpasses my utmost ambition that i have #nothing# more to ask for
i think not sire never #mind# #sir# we #will# not forget you make your #mind# easy
in the meanwhile the #king# here detached the cross of the legion of #honor# which he usually wore over his blue coat near the cross of st $louis_xviii$ above the #order# of notre dame du mont carmel and st lazare and gave it to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in
the meanwhile take this cross sire said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ your majesty mistakes this is an #officer# cross ma foi
said $louis_xviii$ take it such as it is for i have not the #time# to procure you another
$m_de_blacas$ let it be your #care# to see that the brevet is made out and sent to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #eye# were filled with #tear# of #joy# and pride he took the cross and kissed it and now he said may i inquire what are the #order# with which your majesty deigns to #honor# me
take what #rest# you require and remember that if you are not able to serve me here in paris you may be of the greatest #service# to me at marseilles
sire replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ bowing in an #hour# i shall have quitted paris go #sir# said the #king# and should i forget you #king# memories are short
do not be afraid to bring yourself to my recollection #baron# send for the #minister# of war $m_de_blacas$ remain
ah #sir# said the #minister# of #police# to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ as they left the tuileries you entered by luck #door# your #fortune# is made
#will# it be long first muttered $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ saluting the #minister# whose career was ended and looking about him for a hackney coach
#one# passed at the #moment# which he hailed he gave his address to the driver and springing in threw himself on the #seat# and gave loose to #dream# of ambition
ten #minute# afterwards $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ reached his hotel ordered #horse# to be ready in two #hour# and asked to have his breakfast brought to him
he was about to begin his repast when the #sound# of the bell rang sharp and loud the #valet# opened the #door# and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ heard someone speak his #name#
who could know that i was here already said the young #man# the #valet# entered well said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ what is it who rang who asked for me
a #stranger# who #will# not send in his #name# a #stranger# who #will# not send in his #name#
what can he want with me he #wish# to speak to you to me yes
did he mention my #name# yes what #sort# of #person# is he why #sir# a #man# of about fifty
short or tall about your own height #sir# dark or fair dark very dark with black #eye# black #hair# black eyebrows
and how dressed asked $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ quickly in a blue frock coat buttoned up close decorated with the legion of #honor#
it is he said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ turning pale eh $pardieu$ said the individual whose description we have twice given entering the #door# what a great deal of ceremony
is it the custom in marseilles for #son# to keep their #father# waiting in their anterooms #father# cried $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
well then if you felt so sure replied the new comer putting his cane in a #corner# and his hat on a #chair# allow me to say my dear gérard that it was not very filial of you to keep me waiting at the #door#
then i was not deceived i felt sure it must be you leave us germain said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the #servant# quitted the #apartment# with evident #sign# of #astonishment#
#father# and #son# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ for it was indeed he who entered looked after the #servant# until the #door# was closed and then fearing no #doubt# that he might be overheard in the antechamber
he opened the #door# again nor was the precaution useless as appeared from the rapid retreat of germain who proved that he was not exempt from the sin which ruined our first parents
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ then took the trouble to close and bolt the antechamber #door# then that of the bedchamber and then extended his #hand# to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who had followed all his motions with surprise which he could not conceal
well now my dear gérard said he to the young #man# with a very significant #look# do you know you seem as if you were not very glad to see me
#chapter# my dear #father# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i am on the #contrary# delighted but i so little expected your #visit# that it has somewhat overcome me
i might say the same #thing# to you when you announce to me your wedding for the th of february and on the rd of march you #turn# up here in paris
and if i have come my dear #father# said gérard #drawing# closer to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ do not complain for it is for you that i came and my journey #will# be your salvation
but my dear #fellow# replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ seating himself ah indeed said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ stretching himself out at his ease in the #chair#
really pray tell me all about it for it must be interesting #father# you have heard speak of a certain bonapartist club in the rue saint jacques
why my dear #boy# when a #man# has been proscribed by the mountaineers has escaped from paris in a hay cart been hunted over the plains of bordeaux by robespierre bloodhounds he becomes accustomed to most #thing#
no yes i am vice #president# #father# your coolness makes me shudder but go on what about the club in the rue saint jacques
why they induced general $m_franz_de_quesnel$ to go there and general $m_franz_de_quesnel$ who quitted his own $house_of_peers$ at nine clock in the #evening# was found the next #day# in the seine
and who told you this fine #story# the #king# himself well then in #return# for your #story# continued $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
i #will# tell you another my dear #father# i think i already know what you are about to tell me
ah you have heard of the landing of the emperor not so loud #father# i entreat of you for your own sake as well as mine
yes i heard this news and knew it even before you could for three #day# ago i posted from marseilles to paris with all possible speed #half# desperate at the enforced delay
three #day# ago you are crazy why three #day# ago the emperor had not landed no #matter# i was aware of his intention
how did you know about it by a #letter# addressed to you from the #island# of $elba$
to me to you and which i discovered in the #pocket# book of the messenger had that #letter# fallen into the #hand# of another you my dear #father# would probably ere this have been shot
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #father# laughed come come said he #will# the restoration adopt imperial methods so promptly shot my dear #boy#
what an #idea# where is the #letter# you speak of i know you too well to suppose you would allow such a #thing# to pass you
i burnt it for #fear# that even a fragment should remain for that #letter# must have led to your condemnation
and the destruction of your future prospects replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ yes i can easily comprehend that but i have #nothing# to #fear# while i have you to protect me
i do better than that #sir# i save you you do why really the #thing# becomes more and more dramatic explain yourself
i must refer again to the club in the rue saint jacques it appears that this club is rather a bore to the #police#
why didnt they search more vigilantly they would have found they have not found but they are on the track
when the #police# is at fault it declares that it is on the track and the government patiently awaits the #day# when it comes to say with a sneaking #air# that the track is lost
yes but they have found a corpse the general has been killed and in all #country# they call that a murder
yes that the usual phrase i am quite familiar with it a murder do you call it
#people# are found every #day# in the seine having thrown themselves in or having been drowned from not knowing how to swim
#father# you know very well that the general was not a #man# to drown himself in #despair# and #people# do not bathe in the seine in the #month# of january
why there is #nothing# to prove that the general was murdered no no do not be deceived this was murder in every sense of the #word#
and who thus designated it the #king# himself the #king# i #thought# he was philosopher enough to allow that there was no murder in politics
in politics my dear #fellow# you know as well as i do there are no #man# but #idea# no #feeling# but #interest#
in politics we do not kill a #man# we only remove an obstacle that is all would you like to know how #matter# have progressed
it was #thought# reliance might be placed in general $m_franz_de_quesnel$ he was recommended to us from the #island# of $elba$ #one# of us went to him and invited him to the rue saint jacques where he would find some #friend#
well i #will# tell you he came there and the #plan# was unfolded to him for leaving $elba$ the projected landing etc
then all looked at each #other# he was made to take an oath and did so but with such an ill grace that it was really tempting providence to swear thus and yet in #spite# of that the general was allowed to depart free perfectly free
when he had heard and comprehended all to the fullest extent he replied that he was a royalist yet he did not #return# home
what could that #mean# why my dear #fellow# that on leaving us he lost his #way# that all a murder really $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ you surprise me
did i ever say to you when you were fulfilling your character as a royalist and cut off the #head# of #one# of my party
you a deputy #procureur# to found an accusation on such bad premises my #son# you have committed a murder
no i said very well #sir# you have gained the victory #tomorrow# perchance it #will# be our #turn# but #father# take #care# when our #turn# comes our revenge #will# be sweeping
you are mistaken he #will# not advance two leagues into the interior of france without being followed tracked and caught like a wild beast
i do not understand you you rely on the usurper #return# we do
my dear #fellow# the emperor is at this #moment# on the #way# to grenoble on the th or th he #will# be at lyons and on the th or th at paris
the #people# #will# rise yes to go and meet him he has but a handful of #man# with him and armies #will# be despatched against him
really my dear gérard you are but a #child# you think yourself well informed because the telegraph has told you three #day# after the landing
yes to escort him into the capital the usurper has landed at cannes with several #man# he is pursued
but where is he what is he doing you do not know at all and in this #way# they #will# chase him to paris without #drawing# a trigger
grenoble and lyons are faithful cities and #will# oppose to him an impassable barrier grenoble #will# open her #gate# to him with enthusiasm
all lyons #will# hasten to welcome him believe me we are as well informed as you and our #police# are as good as your own
well you wished to conceal your journey from me and yet i knew of your arrival #half# an #hour# after you had passed the barrier
you gave your direction to no #one# but your postilion yet i have your address and in #proof# i am here the very #instant# you are going to sit at #table#
would you like a #proof# of it ring then if you please for a second knife fork and plate and we #will# dine together
indeed replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looking at his #father# with #astonishment# you really do seem very well informed
eh the #thing# is simple enough you who are in #power# have only the #mean# that #money# produces we who are in expectation have those which devotion prompts
devotion said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with a sneer yes devotion for that is i believe the phrase for hopeful ambition
and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #father# extended his #hand# to the bell rope to summon the #servant# whom his #son# had not called $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ caught his #arm#
wait my dear #father# said the young #man# #one# #word# more say on however stupid the royalist #police# may be they do know #one# terrible #thing#
the description of the #man# who on the #morning# of the #day# when general $m_franz_de_quesnel$ disappeared presented himself at his $house_of_peers$
what is that oh the admirable #police# have found that out have they and what may be that description
dark complexion #hair# eyebrows and whiskers black blue frock coat buttoned up to the chin rosette of an #officer# of the legion of #honor# in his button hole a hat with wide brim and a cane
ah ha that it is it said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and why then have they not laid #hand# on him
because #yesterday# or the #day# before they lost #sight# of him at the #corner# of the rue coq héron didnt i say that your #police# were good for #nothing#
true said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looking carelessly around him true if this #person# were not on his guard as he is and he added with a #smile#
yes but they may catch him yet he #will# consequently make a few changes in his personal #appearance#
at these #word# he rose and put off his frock coat and cravat went towards a #table# on which lay his #son# toilet articles lathered his #face# took a razor and with a firm #hand# cut off the compromising whiskers
his whiskers cut off $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ gave another #turn# to his #hair# took instead of his black cravat a colored neckerchief which lay at the top of an open portmanteau put on in lieu of his blue and high buttoned frock coat a coat of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ of dark brown and cut away in front tried on before the #glass# a narrow brimmed hat of his #son# which appeared to fit him perfectly and leaving his cane in the #corner# where he had deposited it he took up a small bamboo switch cut the #air# with it once or twice and walked about with that easy swagger which was #one# of his principal characteristics
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ watched him with alarm not devoid of admiration well he said turning towards his wondering #son# when this disguise was completed
well do you think your #police# #will# recognize me now no #father# stammered $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ at least i #hope# not
and now my dear #boy# continued $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i rely on your prudence to remove all the #thing# which i leave in your #care#
and now i believe you are #right# and that you have really saved my #life# be assured i #will# #return# the favor hereafter
oh rely on me said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ yes yes $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ shook his #head# you are not convinced yet
i #hope# at least that you may be mistaken shall you see the #king# again
perhaps would you pass in his #eye# for a prophet prophets of evil are not in favor at the #court# #father#
true but some #day# they do them #justice# and supposing a second restoration you would then pass for a great #man#
sire you are deceived as to the #feeling# in france as to the #opinion# of the towns and the prejudices of the army he whom in paris you call the corsican ogre who at nevers is styled the usurper is already saluted as $bonaparte$ at lyons and emperor at grenoble
well what should i say to the #king# say this to him you think he is tracked pursued captured he is advancing as rapidly as his own eagles
the #soldier# you believe to be dying with hunger worn out with fatigue ready to desert gather like atoms of snow about the rolling ball as it hastens onward
sire go leave france to its real #master# to him who acquired it not by purchase but by #right# of conquest go sire not that you incur any risk for your adversary is powerful enough to show you mercy but because it would be humiliating for a grandson of saint $louis_xviii$ to owe his #life# to the #man# of arcola marengo austerlitz
keep your journey a #secret# do not boast of what you have come to paris to do or have done #return# with all speed enter marseilles at #night# and your $house_of_peers$ by the back #door# and there remain quiet submissive #secret# and above all inoffensive for this #time# i swear to you we shall act like powerful #man# who know their #enemy#
go my #son# go my dear gérard and by your obedience to my paternal #order# or if you prefer it friendly counsels we #will# keep you in your #place#
this #will# be added $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with a #smile# #one# #mean# by which you may a second #time# save me if the political balance should some #day# take another #turn# and cast you aloft while hurling me down
tell him this gérard or rather tell him #nothing# adieu my dear gérard and at your next journey alight at my #door#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ left the #room# when he had finished with the same calmness that had characterized him during the whole of this remarkable and trying #conversation#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ pale and agitated ran to the #window# put aside the curtain and saw him pass cool and collected by two or three ill looking #man# at the #corner# of the #street# who were there perhaps to arrest a #man# with black whiskers and a blue frock coat and hat with broad brim
then he turned to the various articles he had left behind him put the black cravat and blue frock coat at the bottom of the portmanteau threw the hat into a dark closet broke the cane into small bits and flung it in the #fire# put on his travelling cap and calling his #valet# checked with a #look# the thousand #question# he was ready to ask paid his bill sprang into his #carriage# which was ready learned at lyons that $bonaparte$ had entered grenoble and in the midst of the tumult which prevailed along the #road# at #length# reached marseilles a prey to all the #hope# and #fear# which enter into the #heart# of #man# with ambition and its first successes
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ stood watching breathless until his #father# had disappeared at the rue bussy #chapter# the hundred #day# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was a true prophet and #thing# progressed rapidly as he had predicted
#everyone# knows the history of the famous #return# from $elba$ a #return# which was unprecedented in the past and #will# probably remain without a counterpart in the future
made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow the monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious foundation and at a #sign# from the emperor the incongruous structure of ancient prejudices and new #idea# fell to the #ground#
gratitude which was rather likely to injure him at the present #time# and the cross of the legion of #honor# which he had the prudence not to wear although $m_de_blacas$ had duly forwarded the brevet
had it not been for $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who was all powerful at #court# and thus the girondin of and the senator of protected him who so lately had been his protector
$louis_xviii$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ therefore gained #nothing# save the #king# $napoleon$ would doubtless have deprived $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ of his office all $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ influence barely enabled him to stifle the #secret# $m_dantès$ had so nearly divulged
however scarcely was the imperial #power# established that is scarcely had the emperor re entered the tuileries and begun to issue #order# from the closet into which we have introduced our readers he found on the #table# there $louis_xviii$
#half# filled snuff #box# scarcely had this occurred when marseilles began in #spite# of the authorities to rekindle the flames of civil war always smouldering in the south and it required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater violence than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the royalists whenever they ventured abroad
the #king# #procureur# alone was deprived of his office being suspected of royalism owing to this change the worthy shipowner became at that #moment#
we #will# not say all powerful because $m_maximilian_morrel$ was a prudent and rather a timid #man# so much so that many of the most zealous partisans of $bonaparte$ accused him of moderation but sufficiently influential to make a demand in favor of $m_dantès$
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ retained his #place# but his #marriage# was put off until a more favorable opportunity if the emperor remained on the throne gérard required a different alliance to aid his career if $louis_xviii$
returned the influence of de $madame_de_saint_méran$ like his own could be vastly increased and the #marriage# be still more suitable
the deputy #procureur# was therefore the first #magistrate# of marseilles when #one# #morning# his #door# opened and $m_maximilian_morrel$ was announced
#anyone# else would have hastened to receive him but $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was a #man# of ability and he knew this would be a #sign# of weakness
he made $m_maximilian_morrel$ wait in the antechamber although he had no #one# with him for the simple #reason# that the #king# #procureur# always makes #everyone# wait and after passing a #quarter# of an #hour# in reading the #paper# he ordered $m_maximilian_morrel$ to be admitted
$m_maximilian_morrel$ expected $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ would be dejected he found him as he had found him six weeks before calm firm and full of that glacial politeness that most insurmountable barrier which separates the well bred from the vulgar #man#
he had entered $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ office expecting that the #magistrate# would tremble at the #sight# of him on the #contrary# he felt a cold shudder all over him when he saw $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ sitting there with his elbow on his desk and his #head# leaning on his #hand#
then after a brief interval during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his #hand# $m_maximilian_morrel$ i believe said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
he stopped at the #door# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him yes #sir#
come nearer said the #magistrate# with a patronizing wave of the #hand# and tell me to what #circumstance# i owe the #honor# of this #visit#
do you not guess $monsieur_cavalcanti$ asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ not in the least but if i can serve you in any #way# i shall be delighted
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ said $m_maximilian_morrel$ recovering his assurance as he proceeded do you recollect that a few #day# before the landing of his majesty the emperor i came to intercede for a young #man# the mate of my ship who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the #island# of $elba$
#everything# depends on you explain yourself pray what was the #other# #day# a #crime# is #today# a title to favor
you then served $louis_xviii$ and you did not show any favor it was your #duty# #today# you serve $napoleon$ and you ought to protect him
it is equally your #duty# i come therefore to ask what has become of him $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ by a strong #effort# sought to control himself
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a #pistol# at five and twenty paces than have heard this #name# spoken but he did not blanch
what is his #name# said he tell me his #name# $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ dantès repeated he $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ opened a large register then went to a #table# from the #table# turned to his registers and then turning to $m_maximilian_morrel$
yes $monsieur_cavalcanti$ are you quite sure you are not mistaken $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said he in the most natural #tone# in the #world#
had $m_maximilian_morrel$ been a more quick sighted #man# or better versed in these #matter# he would have been surprised at the #king#
#procureur# answering him on such a #subject# instead of referring him to the #governor# of the #prison# or the prefect of the department
but $m_maximilian_morrel$ disappointed in his expectations of exciting #fear# was conscious only of the #other# condescension $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had calculated rightly
no said $m_maximilian_morrel$ i am not mistaken i have known him for ten #year# the last four of which he was in my #service#
do not you recollect i came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency as i come #today# to plead for #justice#
you received me very coldly oh the royalists were very severe with the bonapartists in those #day# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ returned $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
i was then a royalist because i believed the bourbons not only the heirs to the throne but the chosen of the nation
the miraculous #return# of $napoleon$ has conquered me the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his #people#
that #right# cried $m_maximilian_morrel$ i like to hear you speak thus and i augur well for $edmond_dantès$ from it
wait a #moment# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ turning over the leaves of a register i have it a #sailor# who was about to marry a young catalan #girl#
i recollect now it was a very serious charge how so you know that when he left here he was taken to the palais de #justice#
well i made my report to the authorities at paris and a week after he was carried off
carried off said $m_maximilian_morrel$ what can they have done with him oh he has been taken to fenestrelles to pignerol or to the sainte marguérite #island#
some fine #morning# he #will# #return# to take command of your #vessel# come when he #will# it shall be kept for him
it seems to me the first #care# of government should be to set at #liberty# those who have suffered for their adherence to it
the #order# of imprisonment came from high authority and the #order# for his liberation must proceed from the same source and as $napoleon$ has scarcely been reinstated a fortnight the #letter# have not yet been forwarded
but how is it he is not already returned do not be too hasty $m_maximilian_morrel$ replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
but said $m_maximilian_morrel$ is there no #way# of expediting all these formalities of releasing him from arrest there has been no arrest
it is sometimes essential to government to cause a #man# disappearance without leaving any traces so that no written forms or documents may defeat their #wish#
how it might be so under the bourbons but at present it has always been so my dear $m_maximilian_morrel$ since the reign of $louis_xviii$ xiv
the emperor is more strict in #prison# discipline than even $louis_xviii$ himself and the number of #prisoner# whose #name# are not on the register is incalculable
had $m_maximilian_morrel$ even any suspicions so much kindness would have dispelled them well $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ how would you advise me to act asked he
petition the #minister# oh i know what that is the #minister# receives two hundred petitions every #day# and does not read three
that is true but he #will# read a petition countersigned and presented by me and #will# you undertake to deliver it
$m_dantès$ was then guilty and now he is innocent and it is as much my #duty# to free him as it was to condemn him
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry which however improbable it might be if it did take #place# would leave him defenceless
with the greatest #pleasure# but how shall i address the #minister# sit down there said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ giving up his #place# to $m_maximilian_morrel$ and write what i dictate
#will# you be so good certainly but lose no #time# we have lost too much already
that is true only think what the poor #fellow# may even now be suffering $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ shuddered at the suggestion but he had gone too far to draw back
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ dictated a petition in which from an excellent intention no #doubt# $m_dantès$ patriotic #service# were exaggerated and he was made out #one# of the most active agents of $napoleon$ #return#
$m_dantès$ must be crushed to gratify $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ ambition it was evident that at the #sight# of this document the #minister# would instantly release him
the petition finished $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ read it aloud that #will# do said he leave the #rest# to me #will# the petition go soon
#today# countersigned by you the best #thing# i can do #will# be to certify the #truth# of the contents of your petition
and sitting down $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ wrote the certificate at the bottom what more is to be done i #will# do whatever is necessary
this assurance delighted $m_maximilian_morrel$ who took leave of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and hastened to announce to old $m_dantès$ that he would soon see his #son#
as for $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ instead of sending to paris he carefully preserved the petition that so fearfully compromised $m_dantès$ in the #hope# of an #event# that seemed not unlikely that is a second restoration
$m_dantès$ remained a #prisoner# and heard not the #noise# of the fall of $louis_xviii$ throne or the still more tragic destruction of the empire
twice during the hundred #day# had $m_maximilian_morrel$ renewed his demand and twice had $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ soothed him with #promise# at last there was waterloo and $m_maximilian_morrel$ came no more
he had done all that was in his #power# and any fresh attempt would only compromise himself uselessly $louis_xviii$
remounted the throne $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ to whom marseilles had become filled with remorseful memories sought and obtained the situation of #king# #procureur# at toulouse and a fortnight afterwards
he married $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ de $madame_de_saint_méran$ whose #father# now stood higher at #court# than ever and so $m_dantès$ after the hundred #day# and after waterloo remained in his dungeon forgotten of #earth# and heaven
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed $m_dantès$ and when $napoleon$ returned to france he after the #manner# of mediocre #mind# termed the coincidence a decree of providence
but when $napoleon$ returned to paris $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #heart# failed him and he lived in constant #fear# of $m_dantès$ #return# on a mission of vengeance
he therefore informed $m_maximilian_morrel$ of his #wish# to quit the #sea# and obtained a recommendation from him to a spanish merchant into whose #service# he entered at the #end# of march that is ten or twelve #day# after $napoleon$ #return#
he then left for madrid and was no more heard of $m_fernand_mondego$ understood #nothing# except that $m_dantès$ was absent what had become of him he cared not to inquire
only during the respite the absence of his rival afforded him he reflected partly on the #mean# of deceiving $mercédès$ as to the cause of his absence partly on #plan# of emigration and abduction as from #time# to #time# he sat sad and motionless on the summit of cape pharo at the #spot# from whence marseilles and the catalans are visible watching for the apparition of a young and handsome #man# who was for him also the messenger of vengeance
$m_fernand_mondego$ #mind# was made up he would shoot $m_dantès$ and then kill himself but $m_fernand_mondego$ was mistaken a #man# of his disposition never kills himself for he constantly #hope#
during this #time# the empire made its last conscription and every #man# in france capable of bearing #arm# rushed to obey the summons of the emperor
$m_fernand_mondego$ departed with the #rest# bearing with him the terrible #thought# that while he was away his rival would perhaps #return# and marry $mercédès$
had $m_fernand_mondego$ really meant to kill himself he would have done so when he parted from $mercédès$ his devotion and the compassion he showed for her #misfortune# produced the #effect# they always produce on noble #mind#
my #brother# said she as she placed his knapsack on his #shoulder# be careful of yourself for if you are killed i shall be alone in the #world#
$mercédès$ had always had a sincere regard for $m_fernand_mondego$ and this was now strengthened by gratitude these #word# carried a ray of #hope# into $m_fernand_mondego$ #heart#
m $mercédès$ was left alone #face# to #face# with the vast plain that had never seemed so barren and the #sea# that had never seemed so vast
sometimes she stood mute and motionless as a statue looking towards marseilles at #other# #time# gazing on the #sea# and debating as to whether it were not better to cast herself into the abyss of the ocean and thus #end# her woes
it was not want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution but her religious #feeling# came to her aid and saved her
$m_caderousse$ was like $m_fernand_mondego$ enrolled in the army but being married and eight #year# older he was merely sent to the frontier
should $m_dantès$ not #return# $mercédès$ might #one# #day# be his bathed in #tear# she wandered about the catalan village old $m_dantès$ who was only sustained by #hope# lost all #hope# at $napoleon$ downfall
five #month# after he had been separated from his #son# and almost at the #hour# of his arrest he breathed his last in $mercédès$ #arm#
there was more than benevolence in this action there was courage the south was aflame and to assist even on his #death# #bed# the #father# of so dangerous a bonapartist as $m_dantès$ was stigmatized as a #crime#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ paid the expenses of his funeral and a few small debts the poor old #man# had contracted #chapter#
$m_dantès$ in his cell heard the #noise# of preparation #sound# that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any
but the ear of a #prisoner# who could hear the splash of the drop of #water# that every #hour# fell from the roof of his dungeon
he guessed #something# uncommon was passing among the living but he had so long ceased to have any intercourse with the #world# that he looked upon himself as dead
the #inspector# visited #one# after another the cells and dungeons of several of the #prisoner# whose good behavior or stupidity recommended them to the clemency of the government
the two #prisoner# a #year# after $louis_xviii$ restoration a #visit# was made by the #inspector# general of #prison# he inquired how they were fed and if they had any request to make
the universal response was that the fare was detestable and that they wanted to be set free the #inspector# asked if they had #anything# else to ask for
i do not know what #reason# government can assign for these useless #visit# when you see #one# #prisoner# you see all always the same #thing# ill fed and innocent
they shook their #head# what could they #desire# beyond their #liberty# the #inspector# turned smilingly to the #governor# are there any #other#
yes the dangerous and mad #prisoner# are in the dungeons let us #visit# them said the #inspector# with an #air# of fatigue
we must play the farce to the #end# let us see the dungeons let us first send for two #soldier# said the #governor#
the #prisoner# sometimes through mere uneasiness of #life# and in #order# to be sentenced to #death# commit acts of useless violence and you might fall a victim
two #soldier# were accordingly sent for and the #inspector# descended a stairway so foul so humid so dark as to be loathsome to #sight# smell and respiration
a most dangerous conspirator a #man# we are ordered to keep the most strict watch over as he is daring and resolute
take all needful precautions replied the #inspector# oh cried the #inspector# who can live here
he is alone certainly how long has he been there nearly a #year#
was he placed here when he first arrived no not until he attempted to kill the turnkey who took his food to him
to kill the turnkey yes the very #one# who is lighting us is it not true antoine asked the #governor#
true enough he wanted to kill me returned the turnkey he must be mad said the #inspector# he is worse than that he is a devil returned the turnkey
shall i complain of him demanded the #inspector# oh no it is useless besides he is almost mad now and in another #year# he #will# be quite so
so much the better for him he #will# suffer less said the #inspector# he was as this remark shows a #man# full of philanthropy and in every #way# fit for his office
now we have in a dungeon about twenty #foot# distant and to which you descend by another stair an old #abbé# formerly leader of a party in italy who has been here since and in he went mad and the change is astonishing
you are #right# #sir# replied the #governor# and this remark proves that you have deeply considered the #subject# he used to weep he now laughs
he grew thin he now grows fat you had better see him for his madness is amusing i #will# see them both returned the #inspector# i must conscientiously perform my #duty#
this was the #inspector# first #visit# he wished to display his authority let us #visit# this #one# first added he
at the #sound# of the key turning in the lock and the creaking of the hinges $m_dantès$ who was crouched in a #corner# of the dungeon whence he could see the ray of #light# that came through a narrow #iron# grating above raised his #head#
seeing a #stranger# escorted by two turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two #soldier# and to whom the #governor# spoke bareheaded $m_dantès$ who guessed the #truth# and that the #moment# to address himself to the superior authorities was come sprang forward with clasped #hand#
the #soldier# interposed their bayonets for they #thought# that he was about to attack the #inspector# and the latter recoiled two or three #step#
by all #mean# replied the #governor# and he signed to the turnkey to open the #door# $m_dantès$ saw that he was looked upon as dangerous
then infusing all the humility he possessed into his #eye# and #voice# he addressed the #inspector# and sought to inspire him with #pity#
he is already more gentle he is afraid and retreated before the bayonets madmen are not afraid of #anything# i made some curious observations on this at charenton
the #inspector# listened attentively then turning to the #governor# observed he #will# become religious then turning to the #prisoner# what is it you want said he
i want to know what #crime# i have committed to be tried and if i am guilty to be shot if innocent to be set at #liberty#
are you well fed said the #inspector# i believe so i dont know it of no consequence
what #matter# really not only to me but to #officer# of #justice# and the #king# is that an innocent #man# should languish in #prison# the victim of an infamous denunciation to die here cursing his executioners
you are very humble #today# remarked the #governor# you are not so always the #other# #day# for instance when you tried to kill the turnkey
it is true #sir# and i beg his pardon for he has always been very good to me but i was mad
and you are not so any longer no captivity has subdued me i have been here so long
so long when were you arrested then asked the #inspector# the th of february at #half# past two in the afternoon
#today# is the th of july why it is but seventeen #month# only seventeen #month# replied $m_dantès$
oh you do not know what is seventeen #month# in #prison# seventeen #age# rather especially to a #man# who like me had arrived at the summit of his ambition to a #man# who like me was on the #point# of marrying a #woman# he adored who saw an honorable career opened before him and who loses all in an #instant# who sees his prospects destroyed and is ignorant of the fate of his affianced #wife# and whether his aged #father# be still living
seventeen #month# captivity to a #sailor# accustomed to the boundless ocean is a worse punishment than human #crime# ever merited
have #pity# on me then and ask for me not intelligence but a trial not pardon but a verdict a trial #sir# i ask only for a trial that surely cannot be denied to #one# who is accused
we shall see said the #inspector# then turning to the #governor# on my #word# the poor devil touches me
you must show me the #proof# against him certainly but you #will# find terrible charges $monsieur_cavalcanti$ continued $m_dantès$
i know it is not in your #power# to release me but you can plead for me you can have me tried
and that is all i ask let me know my #crime# and the #reason# why i was condemned uncertainty is worse than all
go on with the #light# said the #inspector# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ cried $m_dantès$ i can tell by your #voice# you are touched with #pity# tell me at least to #hope#
i cannot tell you that replied the #inspector# i can only #promise# to examine into your #case#
oh i am free then i am saved who arrested you $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ see him and hear what he says
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ is no longer at marseilles he is now at toulouse i am no longer surprised at my detention murmured $m_dantès$
since my only protector is removed had $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ any cause of personal dislike to you none on the #contrary# he was very kind to me
i can then rely on the #note# he has left concerning you entirely that is well wait patiently then
$m_dantès$ fell on his knees and prayed earnestly the #door# closed but this #time# a fresh inmate was left with $m_dantès$ #hope#
#will# you see the register at once asked the #governor# or proceed to the #other# cell let us #visit# them all said the #inspector#
if i once went up those stairs i should never have the courage to come down again ah this #one# is not like the #other# and his madness is less affecting than this #one# display of #reason#
what is his folly he fancies he possesses an immense #treasure# the first #year# he offered government a #million# of #franc# for his release
he is now in his fifth #year# of captivity he #will# ask to speak to you in private and offer you five #million#
the second two the third three and so on progressively how curious what is his #name# the $abbé_faria$
the turnkey obeyed and the #inspector# gazed curiously into the #chamber# of the mad #abbé# as the #prisoner# was usually called
in the centre of the cell in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster detached from the #wall# sat a #man# whose tattered garments scarcely covered him
he was #drawing# in this circle geometrical #line# and seemed as much absorbed in his problem as archimedes was when the #soldier# of marcellus slew him
he did not move at the #sound# of the #door# and continued his calculations until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the sombre #wall# of his cell then raising his #head# he perceived with #astonishment# the number of #person# present
no said the #inspector# it is here unlock the #door# antoine he hastily seized the coverlet of his #bed# and wrapped it round him
what is it you want said the #inspector# i $monsieur_cavalcanti$ replied the #abbé# with an #air# of surprise i want #nothing#
you do not understand continued the #inspector# i am sent here by government to #visit# the #prison# and hear the requests of the #prisoner#
oh that is different cried the #abbé# and we shall understand each #other# i #hope# there now whispered the #governor#
it is just as i told you $monsieur_cavalcanti$ continued the #prisoner# i am the $abbé_faria$ born at rome
i was arrested why i know not toward the beginning of the #year# since then i have demanded my #liberty# from the italian and french government
because i was arrested at piombino and i presume that like milan and florence piombino has become the capital of some french department
i was for twenty #year# $cardinal_spada$ secretary why from the french government ah said the #inspector#
you have not the latest news from italy my information dates from the #day# on which i was arrested returned the $abbé_faria$
i presume that he has realized the #dream# of machiavelli and $cæsar_borgia$ which was to make italy a united kingdom
and as the emperor had created the kingdom of rome for his infant #son# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ returned the #inspector# providence has changed this gigantic #plan# you advocate so warmly
very possibly only i am not come to discuss politics but to inquire if you have #anything# to ask or to complain of
it is the only #mean# of rendering italy strong happy and independent the food is the same as in #other#
the lodging is very unhealthful but on the whole passable for a dungeon but it is not that which i #wish# to speak of but a #secret# i have to reveal of the greatest importance
it is for that #reason# i am delighted to see you continued the #abbé# although you have disturbed me in a most important calculation which if it succeeded would possibly change newton system
#prison# that is very bad we are coming to the #point# whispered the #governor# could you allow me a few #word# in private
what did i tell you said the #governor# you knew him returned the #inspector# with a #smile#
what you ask is impossible $monsieur_cavalcanti$ continued he addressing $abbé_faria$ but said the #abbé# i would speak to you of a large #sum# amounting to five #million#
however continued $abbé_faria$ seeing that the #inspector# was about to depart it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone the #governor# can be present
the very #sum# you named whispered the #inspector# in his #turn# unfortunately said the #governor#
i know beforehand what you are about to say it concerns your #treasure# does it not $abbé_faria$ fixed his #eye# on him with an #expression# that would have convinced #anyone# else of his sanity
i can tell you the #story# as well as he for it has been dinned in my ears for the last four or five #year#
of #course# said he of what else should i speak mr #inspector# continued the #governor#
that proves returned the #abbé# that you are like those of holy writ who having #eye# see not and having ears hear not
my dear #sir# the government is rich and does not want your #treasure# replied the #inspector# keep them until you are liberated
the #abbé# #eye# glistened he seized the #inspector# #hand# but what if i am not liberated cried he and am detained here until my #death#
i #will# offer six #million# and i #will# content myself with the #rest# if they #will# only give me my #liberty#
on my #word# said the #inspector# in a low #tone# had i not been told beforehand that this #man# was mad i should believe what he says
this #treasure# #will# be lost had not government better profit by it i am not mad replied $abbé_faria$ with that acuteness of hearing peculiar to #prisoner#
the #treasure# i speak of really exists and i offer to #sign# an agreement with you in which i #promise# to lead you to the #spot# where you shall dig and if i deceive you bring me here
again i ask no more the #governor# laughed is the #spot# far from here a hundred leagues
if all the #prisoner# took it into their #head# to travel a hundred leagues and their guardians consented to accompany them they would have a capital #chance# of escaping
it is not ill planned said the #governor# the scheme is well known said the #inspector# and the #abbé# #plan# has not even the merit of originality
swear to me replied $abbé_faria$ to free me if what i tell you prove true and i #will# stay here while you go to the #spot#
then turning to $abbé_faria$ i inquired if you are well fed said he are you well fed
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ you run no risk for as i told you i #will# stay here so there is no #chance# of my escaping
repeated the #inspector# you do not reply to my #question# replied the #inspector# impatiently nor you to mine cried the #abbé#
you #will# not accept my #gold# i #will# keep it for myself you refuse me my #liberty# god #will# give it me
and the #abbé# casting away his coverlet resumed his #place# and continued his calculations what is he doing there said the #inspector#
counting his #treasure# replied the #governor# $abbé_faria$ replied to this sarcasm with a #glance# of profound contempt they went out
the turnkey closed the #door# behind them he was wealthy once perhaps said the #inspector# or dreamed he was and awoke mad
after all said the #inspector# if he had been rich he would not have been here so the #matter# ended for the $abbé_faria$
caligula or nero those #treasure# seekers those desirers of the impossible would have accorded to the poor wretch in exchange for his wealth the #liberty# he so earnestly prayed for
he remained in his cell and this #visit# only increased the belief in his insanity but the #king# of modern #time# restrained by the limits of mere probability have neither courage nor #desire#
they #fear# the ear that hears their #order# and the #eye# that scrutinizes their actions formerly they believed themselves sprung from jupiter and shielded by their birth but nowadays they are not inviolable
as the inquisition rarely allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh lacerated by torture so madness is always concealed in its cell from whence should it depart it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital where the #doctor# has no #thought# for #man# or #mind# in the mutilated being the #jailer# delivers to him
it has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer the victims of their persecutions to reappear the very madness of the $abbé_faria$ gone mad in #prison# condemned him to perpetual captivity
the #inspector# kept his #word# with $m_dantès$ he examined the register and found the following #note# concerning him $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ violent bonapartist took an active #part# in the #return# from $elba$
the greatest watchfulness and #care# to be exercised this #note# was in a different #hand# from the #rest# which showed that it had been added since his confinement
this #visit# had infused new vigor into $m_dantès$ he had till then forgotten the date but now with a fragment of plaster he wrote the date th july and made a mark every #day# in #order# not to lose his reckoning again
the #inspector# could not contend against this accusation he simply wrote #nothing# to be done #day# and weeks passed away then #month# $m_dantès$ still waited he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight
this fortnight expired he decided that the #inspector# would do #nothing# until his #return# to paris and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished he therefore fixed three #month# three #month# passed away then six more
finally ten #month# and a #half# had gone by and no favorable change had taken #place# and $m_dantès$ began to fancy the #inspector#
#visit# but a #dream# an illusion of the brain at the expiration of a #year# the #governor# was transferred he had obtained charge of the fortress at ham
a new #governor# arrived it would have been too tedious to acquire the #name# of the #prisoner# he learned their numbers instead
this horrible #place# contained fifty cells their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their cell and the unhappy young #man# was no longer called $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$
he took with him several of his subordinates and amongst them $m_dantès$ #jailer# he was now number #chapter# number and number
he was sustained at first by that pride of conscious innocence which is the sequence to #hope# then he began to #doubt# his own innocence which justified in some measure the #governor# belief in his mental alienation and then relaxing his sentiment of pride he addressed his supplications not to god but to #man#
unfortunates who ought to begin with god do not have any #hope# in him till they have exhausted all #other# #mean# of deliverance
$m_dantès$ asked to be removed from his present dungeon into another even if it were darker and deeper for a change however disadvantageous was still a change and would afford him some amusement
$m_dantès$ passed through all the stages of torture natural to #prisoner# in suspense god is always the last resource he entreated to be allowed to walk about to have fresh #air# books and writing materials
he accustomed himself to speaking to the new #jailer# although the latter was if possible more taciturn than the old #one# but still to speak to a #man# even though mute was #something#
$m_dantès$ spoke for the sake of hearing his own #voice# he had tried to speak when alone but the #sound# of his #voice# terrified him
often before his captivity $m_dantès$ #mind# had revolted at the #idea# of assemblages of #prisoner# made up of thieves vagabonds and murderers
he now wished to be amongst them in #order# to see some #other# #face# besides that of his #jailer# he sighed for the galleys with the infamous #costume# the chain and the brand on the #shoulder#
his requests were not granted but he went on asking all the same the galley slaves breathed the fresh #air# of heaven and saw each #other#
they were very happy he besought the #jailer# #one# #day# to let him have a #companion# were it even the mad #abbé#
at the bottom of his #heart# he had often had a #feeling# of #pity# for this unhappy young #man# who suffered so and he laid the request of number before the #governor# but the latter sapiently imagined that $m_dantès$ wished to conspire or attempt an escape and refused his request
the #jailer# though rough and hardened by the constant #sight# of so much suffering was yet a #man# $m_dantès$ had exhausted all human resources and he then turned to god
all the pious #idea# that had been so long forgotten returned he recollected the prayers his #mother# had taught him and discovered a new meaning in every #word# for in prosperity prayers seem but a mere medley of #word# until #misfortune# comes and the unhappy sufferer first understands the meaning of the sublime language in which he invokes the #pity# of heaven
he prayed and prayed aloud no longer terrified at the #sound# of his own #voice# for he fell into a #sort# of ecstasy
he laid every action of his #life# before the almighty proposed tasks to accomplish and at the #end# of every prayer introduced the entreaty oftener addressed to #man# than to god
forgive us our trespasses as we forgive them that trespass against us yet in #spite# of his earnest prayers $m_dantès$ remained a #prisoner#
$m_dantès$ was a #man# of great simplicity of #thought# and without education he could not therefore in the solitude of his dungeon traverse in mental vision the history of the #age# bring to #life# the nations that had perished and rebuild the ancient cities so vast and stupendous in the #light# of the imagination and that pass before the #eye# glowing with celestial colors in martin babylonian pictures
he could not do this he whose past #life# was so short whose present so melancholy and his future so doubtful
no distraction could come to his aid his energetic spirit that would have exalted in thus revisiting the past was imprisoned like an eagle in a cage
then gloom settled heavily upon him nineteen #year# of #light# to reflect upon in eternal #darkness# he clung to #one# #idea#
that of his #happiness# destroyed without apparent cause by an unheard of fatality he considered and reconsidered this #idea# devoured it so to speak as the implacable ugolino devours the skull of archbishop roger in the inferno of dante
$m_dantès$ uttered blasphemies that made his #jailer# recoil with horror dashed himself furiously against the #wall# of his #prison# wreaked his anger upon #everything# and chiefly upon himself so that the least #thing# a grain of sand a straw or a breath of #air# that annoyed him led to paroxysms of fury
then the #letter# that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had showed to him recurred to his #mind# and every #line# gleamed forth in fiery #letter# on the #wall# like the mene mene tekel upharsin of belshazzar
he told himself that it was the enmity of #man# and not the vengeance of heaven that had thus plunged him into the deepest misery
he consigned his unknown persecutors to the most horrible tortures he could imagine and found them all insufficient because after torture came #death# and after #death# if not repose at least the boon of unconsciousness
rage supplanted religious fervor by dint of constantly dwelling on the #idea# that tranquillity was #death# and if punishment were the #end# in view
#other# tortures than #death# must be invented he began to reflect on suicide unhappy he who on the brink of #misfortune# broods over #idea# like these
before him is a dead #sea# that stretches in azure calm before the #eye# but he who unwarily ventures within its embrace finds himself struggling with a monster that would drag him down to perdition
once thus ensnared unless the protecting #hand# of god snatch him thence all is over and his struggles but tend to hasten his destruction
this state of mental anguish is however less terrible than the sufferings that precede or the punishment that possibly #will# follow
there is a #sort# of consolation at the contemplation of the yawning abyss at the bottom of which lie #darkness# and obscurity
all his sorrows all his sufferings with their train of gloomy spectres fled from his cell when the angel of #death# seemed about to enter
$m_dantès$ reviewed his past #life# with composure and looking forward with #terror# to his future existence chose that middle #line# that seemed to afford him a refuge
sometimes said he in my voyages when i was a #man# and commanded #other# #man# i have seen the heavens overcast the #sea# rage and foam the storm arise and like a monstrous bird beating the two horizons with its wings
$edmond_dantès$ found some solace in these #idea# then i felt that my #vessel# was a vain refuge that trembled and shook before the tempest
soon the fury of the waves and the #sight# of the sharp #rock# announced the approach of #death# and #death# then terrified me and i used all my skill and intelligence as a #man# and a #sailor# to struggle against the wrath of god
but i did so because i was happy because i had not courted #death# because to be cast upon a #bed# of #rock# and seaweed
seemed terrible because i was unwilling that i a creature made for the #service# of god should serve for food to the gulls and ravens
but now it is different i have lost all that bound me to #life# #death# #smile# and invites me to repose i die after my own #manner# i die exhausted and broken spirited as i fall asleep when i have paced three thousand #time# round
no sooner had this #idea# taken #possession# of him than he became more composed arranged his couch to the best of his #power# ate little and slept less and found existence almost supportable because he felt that he could throw it off at #pleasure# like a worn out garment
my cell that is thirty thousand #step# or about ten leagues two methods of self destruction were at his disposal he could hang himself with his handkerchief to the #window# bars or refuse food and die of starvation
$m_dantès$ had always entertained the greatest horror of pirates who are hung up to the yard #arm# he would not die by what seemed an infamous #death#
but the first was repugnant to him he resolved to adopt the second and began that #day# to carry out his resolve
m nearly four #year# had passed away at the #end# of the second he had ceased to mark the lapse of #time#
$m_dantès$ said i #wish# to die and had chosen the #manner# of his #death# and fearful of changing his #mind# he had taken an oath to die
when my #morning# and #evening# meals are brought #thought# he i #will# cast them out of the #window# and they #will# think that i have eaten them
he kept his #word# twice a #day# he cast out through the barred aperture the provisions his #jailer# brought him at first gayly then with deliberation and at last with regret
hunger made viands once repugnant now acceptable he held the plate in his #hand# for an #hour# at a #time# and gazed thoughtfully at the morsel of bad meat of tainted fish of black and mouldy bread
it was the last yearning for #life# contending with the resolution of #despair# then his dungeon seemed less sombre his prospects less desperate
#nothing# but the recollection of his oath gave him #strength# to proceed he was still young he was only four or five and twenty
he had nearly fifty #year# to live what unforseen #event# might not open his #prison# #door# and restore him to #liberty#
then he raised to his #lip# the repast that like a voluntary tantalus he refused himself but he #thought# of his oath and he would not break it
he persisted until at last he had not sufficient #strength# to rise and cast his supper out of the loophole the next #morning# he could not see or hear the #jailer# feared he was dangerously ill
$edmond_dantès$ felt a #sort# of stupor creeping over him which brought with it a #feeling# almost of content the gnawing pain at his stomach had ceased his thirst had abated when he closed his #eye# he saw myriads of #light# dancing before them like the #will# the wisps that play about the marshes
$edmond_dantès$ hoped he was dying thus the #day# passed away it was the twilight of that mysterious #country# called #death# suddenly about nine clock in the #evening# $edmond_dantès$ heard a hollow #sound# in the #wall# against which he was lying
so many loathsome animals inhabited the #prison# that their #noise# did not in general awake him but whether abstinence had quickened his faculties or whether the #noise# was really louder than usual $edmond_dantès$ raised his #head# and listened
it was a continual scratching as if made by a huge claw a powerful tooth or some #iron# instrument attacking the #stone#
it seemed to him that heaven had at #length# taken #pity# on him and had sent this #noise# to warn him on the very brink of the abyss
perhaps #one# of those beloved #one# he had so often #thought# of was thinking of him and striving to diminish the #distance# that separated them
although weakened the young #man# brain instantly responded to the #idea# that haunts all #prisoner# #liberty# no no doubtless he was deceived and it was but #one# of those #dream# that forerun #death#
$edmond_dantès$ still heard the #sound# it lasted nearly three #hour# he then heard a #noise# of #something# falling and all was silent
for a week since he had resolved to die and during the four #day# that he had been carrying out his #purpose# $edmond_dantès$ had not spoken to the attendant had not answered him when he inquired what was the #matter# with him and turned his #face# to the #wall# when he looked too curiously at him but now the #jailer# might hear the #noise# and put an #end# to it and so destroy a ray of #something# like #hope# that soothed his last #moment#
some #hour# afterwards it began again nearer and more distinct $edmond_dantès$ was intensely interested suddenly the #jailer# entered the #jailer# brought him his breakfast
$m_dantès$ raised himself up and began to talk about #everything# about the bad quality of the food about the coldness of his dungeon grumbling and complaining in #order# to have an excuse for speaking louder and wearying the patience of his #jailer# who out of kindness of #heart# had brought broth and white bread for his #prisoner#
fortunately he fancied that $m_dantès$ was delirious and placing the food on the rickety #table# he withdrew $edmond_dantès$ listened and the #sound# became more and more distinct
there can be no #doubt# about it #thought# he it is some #prisoner# who is striving to obtain his freedom
oh if i were only there to help him suddenly another #idea# took #possession# of his #mind# so used to #misfortune# that it was scarcely capable of #hope#
the #idea# that the #noise# was made by workmen the #governor# had ordered to repair the neighboring dungeon it was easy to ascertain this but how could he risk the #question#
it was easy to call his #jailer# #attention# to the #noise# and watch his #countenance# as he listened but might he not by this #mean# destroy #hope# far more important than the short lived satisfaction of his own curiosity
unfortunately $edmond_dantès$ brain was still so feeble that he could not bend his #thought# to #anything# in particular he saw but #one# #mean# of restoring lucidity and clearness to his judgment
he turned his #eye# towards the soup which the #jailer# had brought rose staggered towards it raised the #vessel# to his #lip# and drank off the contents with a #feeling# of indescribable #pleasure#
he had the resolution to stop with this he had often heard that shipwrecked #person# had died through having eagerly devoured too much food
$edmond_dantès$ replaced on the #table# the bread he was about to devour and returned to his couch he did not #wish# to die
he soon felt that his #idea# became again collected he could think and strengthen his #thought# by reasoning then he said to himself
if it is a workman i need but knock against the #wall# and he #will# cease to #work# in #order# to find out who is knocking and why he does so but as his occupation is sanctioned by the #governor# he #will# soon resume it
if on the #contrary# it is a #prisoner# the #noise# i make #will# alarm him he #will# cease and not begin again until he thinks #everyone# is asleep
$edmond_dantès$ rose again but this #time# his legs did not tremble and his #sight# was clear he went to a #corner# of his dungeon detached a #stone# and with it knocked against the #wall# where the #sound# came
i must put this to the test but without compromising anybody he struck thrice at the first blow the #sound# ceased as if by magic
$edmond_dantès$ listened intently an #hour# passed two #hour# passed and no #sound# was heard from the #wall# all was silent there
full of #hope# $edmond_dantès$ swallowed a few mouthfuls of bread and #water# and #thank# to the vigor of his constitution found himself well nigh recovered
the #day# passed away in utter #silence# #night# came without recurrence of the #noise# it is a #prisoner# said $edmond_dantès$ joyfully
his brain was on #fire# and #life# and energy returned the #night# passed in perfect #silence# $edmond_dantès$ did not close his #eye#
he had already devoured those of the previous #day# he ate these listening anxiously for the #sound# walking round and round his cell shaking the #iron# bars of the loophole restoring vigor and agility to his limbs by exercise and so preparing himself for his future destiny
at intervals he listened to learn if the #noise# had not begun again and grew impatient at the prudence of the #prisoner# who did not guess he had been disturbed by a captive as anxious for #liberty# as himself
in the #morning# the #jailer# brought him fresh provisions three #day# passed seventy two long tedious #hour# which he counted off by #minute#
at #length# #one# #evening# as the #jailer# was visiting him for the last #time# that #night# $m_dantès$ with his ear for the hundredth #time# at the #wall# fancied he heard an almost imperceptible movement among the #stone#
he moved away walked up and down his cell to collect his #thought# and then went back and listened the #matter# was no longer doubtful
#something# was at #work# on the #other# #side# of the #wall# the #prisoner# had discovered the danger and had substituted a lever for a chisel
he began by moving his #bed# and looked around for #anything# with which he could pierce the #wall# penetrate the moist cement and displace a #stone#
he saw #nothing# he had no knife or sharp instrument the #window# grating was of #iron# but he had too often assured himself of its solidity
encouraged by this discovery $edmond_dantès$ determined to assist the indefatigable laborer all his furniture consisted of a #bed# a #chair# a #table# a pail and a jug
the #bed# had #iron# clamps but they were screwed to the wood and it would have required a screw driver to take them off
$m_dantès$ had but #one# resource which was to break the jug and with #one# of the sharp fragments attack the #wall#
the #table# and #chair# had #nothing# the pail had once possessed a handle but that had been removed he let the jug fall on the #floor# and it broke in #piece#
$m_dantès$ concealed two or three of the sharpest fragments in his #bed# leaving the #rest# on the #floor# the breaking of his jug was too natural an accident to excite suspicion
$edmond_dantès$ had all the #night# to #work# in but in the #darkness# he could not do much and he soon felt that he was working against #something# very hard he pushed back his #bed# and waited for #day#
$m_dantès$ told him that the jug had fallen from his #hand# while he was drinking and the #jailer# went grumblingly to fetch another without giving himself the trouble to remove the fragments of the broken #one#
all #night# he heard the subterranean workman who continued to mine his #way# #day# came the #jailer# entered he returned speedily advised the #prisoner# to be more careful and departed
$m_dantès$ heard joyfully the key grate in the lock he listened until the #sound# of #step# died away and then hastily displacing his #bed# saw by the faint #light# that penetrated into his cell that he had labored uselessly the previous #evening# in attacking the #stone# instead of removing the plaster that surrounded it
the damp had rendered it friable and $m_dantès$ was able to break it off in small morsels it is true but at the #end# of #half# an #hour# he had scraped off a handful a mathematician might have calculated that in two #year# supposing that the #rock# was not encountered a passage twenty #foot# long and two #foot# broad might be formed
the #prisoner# reproached himself with not having thus employed the #hour# he had passed in vain #hope# prayer and despondency during the six #year# that he had been imprisoned what might he not have accomplished
this #idea# imparted new energy and in three #day# he had succeeded with the utmost precaution in removing the cement and exposing the #stone# #work#
the #wall# was built of rough #stone# among which to give #strength# to the structure blocks of hewn #stone# were at intervals imbedded
it was #one# of these he had uncovered and which he must remove from its socket $m_dantès$ strove to do this with his nails but they were too weak
was he to be thus stopped at the beginning and was he to wait inactive until his #fellow# workman had completed his task
the fragments of the jug broke and after an #hour# of useless toil $m_dantès$ paused with anguish on his #brow# suddenly an #idea# occurred to him he smiled and the perspiration dried on his #forehead#
the #jailer# always brought $m_dantès$ soup in an #iron# saucepan this saucepan contained soup for both #prisoner# for $m_dantès$ had noticed that it was either quite full or #half# empty according as the turnkey gave it to him or to his #companion# first
the handle of this saucepan was of #iron# $m_dantès$ would have given ten #year# of his #life# in exchange for it
the #jailer# was accustomed to pour the contents of the saucepan into $m_dantès$ plate and $m_dantès$ after eating his soup with a wooden spoon washed the plate which thus served for every #day#
now when #evening# came $m_dantès$ put his plate on the #ground# near the #door# the #jailer# as he entered stepped on it and broke it
this #time# he could not blame $m_dantès$ he was wrong to leave it there but the #jailer# was wrong not to have looked before him
the #jailer# therefore only grumbled then he looked about for #something# to pour the soup into $m_dantès$ entire #dinner# #service# consisted of #one# plate
there was no alternative leave the saucepan said $m_dantès$ you can take it away when you bring me my breakfast
this advice was to the #jailer# taste as it spared him the necessity of making another trip he left the saucepan
he rapidly devoured his food and after waiting an #hour# lest the #jailer# should change his #mind# and #return# he removed his #bed# took the handle of the saucepan inserted the #point# between the hewn #stone# and rough #stone# of the #wall# and employed it as a lever
at the #end# of an #hour# the #stone# was extricated from the #wall# leaving a cavity a #foot# and a #half# in diameter
$m_dantès$ was beside himself with #joy# a slight oscillation showed $m_dantès$ that all went well $m_dantès$ carefully collected the plaster carried it into the #corner# of his cell and covered it with #earth#
then wishing to make the best #use# of his #time# while he had the #mean# of labor he continued to #work# without ceasing
at the dawn of #day# he replaced the #stone# pushed his #bed# against the #wall# and lay down the breakfast consisted of a #piece# of bread the #jailer# entered and placed the bread on the #table#
first you break your jug then you make me break your plate if all the #prisoner# followed your example the government would be ruined
well dont you intend to bring me another plate said $m_dantès$ no replied the turnkey you destroy #everything# i shall leave you the saucepan and pour your soup into that
so for the future i #hope# you #will# not be so destructive $m_dantès$ raised his #eye# to heaven and clasped his #hand# beneath the coverlet
he had noticed however that the #prisoner# on the #other# #side# had ceased to labor no #matter# this was a greater #reason# for proceeding if his neighbor would not come to him he would go to his neighbor
all #day# he toiled on untiringly and by the #evening# he had succeeded in extracting ten handfuls of plaster and fragments of #stone#
when the #hour# for his #jailer# #visit# arrived $m_dantès$ straightened the handle of the saucepan as well as he could and placed it in its accustomed #place#
the turnkey poured his ration of soup into it together with the fish for thrice a week the #prisoner# were deprived of meat
he felt more gratitude for the #possession# of this #piece# of #iron# than he had ever felt for #anything# this would have been a method of reckoning #time# had not $m_dantès$ long ceased to do so
having poured out the soup the turnkey retired $m_dantès$ wished to ascertain whether his neighbor had really ceased to #work# he listened
all was silent as it had been for the last three #day# $m_dantès$ sighed it was evident that his neighbor distrusted him
the #iron# made no impression but met with a smooth surface $m_dantès$ touched it and found that it was a beam
this beam crossed or rather blocked up the hole $m_dantès$ had made it was necessary therefore to dig above or under it
however he toiled on all the #night# without being discouraged but after two or three #hour# he encountered an obstacle the unhappy young #man# had not #thought# of this
oh my god my god murmured he i have so earnestly prayed to you that i hoped my prayers had been heard
after having deprived me of my #liberty# after having deprived me of #death# after having recalled me to existence my god have #pity# on me and do not let me die in #despair#
said a #voice# that seemed to come from beneath the #earth# and deadened by the #distance# sounded hollow and sepulchral in the young #man# ears
who talks of god and #despair# at the same #time# $edmond_dantès$ #hair# stood on #end# and he rose to his knees
$edmond_dantès$ had not heard #anyone# speak save his #jailer# for four or five #year# and a #jailer# is no #man# to a #prisoner#
ah said he i hear a human #voice# he is a living #door# a barrier of flesh and #blood# adding #strength# to restraints of oak and #iron#
in the #name# of heaven cried $m_dantès$ speak again though the #sound# of your #voice# terrifies me who are you
who are you said the #voice# an unhappy #prisoner# replied $m_dantès$ who made no hesitation in answering
of what #country# a frenchman your #name# $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ your profession a #sailor# how long have you been here
since the th of february your #crime# i am innocent but of what are you accused
of having conspired to aid the emperor #return# what for the emperor #return# the emperor is no longer on the throne then
he abdicated at fontainebleau in and was sent to the #island# of $elba$ but how long have you been here that you are ignorant of all this
since $m_dantès$ shuddered this #man# had been four #year# longer than himself in #prison# do not dig any more said the #voice# only tell me how high up is your excavation
on a level with the #floor# how is it concealed behind my #bed# has your #bed# been moved since you have been a #prisoner#
no what does your #chamber# open on a corridor and the corridor on a #court#
alas murmured the #voice# oh what is the #matter# cried $m_dantès$ i have made a mistake owing to an error in my #plan#
i took the wrong angle and have come out fifteen #foot# from where i intended i took the #wall# you are mining for the outer #wall# of the fortress
but then you would be close to the #sea# that is what i hoped and supposing you had succeeded
i should have thrown myself into the #sea# gained #one# of the #island# near here the isle de daume or the isle de tiboulen
and then i should have been safe could you have swum so far heaven would have given me #strength# but now all is lost
all yes stop up your excavation carefully do not #work# any more and wait until you hear from me
tell me at least who you are i am i am no you mistrust me then said $m_dantès$
$edmond_dantès$ fancied he heard a bitter laugh resounding from the depths oh i am a christian cried $m_dantès$ guessing instinctively that this #man# meant to abandon him
i swear to you by him who died for us that naught shall induce me to breathe #one# syllable to my #jailer# but i conjure you do not abandon me
if you do i swear to you for i have got to the #end# of my #strength# that i #will# dash my brains out against the #wall# and you #will# have my #death# to reproach yourself with
how old are you your #voice# is that of a young #man# i do not know my #age# for i have not counted the #year# i have been here
all i do know is that i was just nineteen when i was arrested the th of february
not quite twenty six murmured the #voice# at that #age# he cannot be a traitor oh no no cried $m_dantès$
i swear to you again rather than betray you i would allow myself to be hacked in #piece#
you have done well to speak to me and ask for my assistance for i was about to form another #plan# and leave you but your #age# reassures me
i #will# not forget you wait how long i must calculate our #chance# i #will# give you the signal
but you #will# not leave me you #will# come to me or you #will# let me come to you
we #will# escape and if we cannot escape we #will# talk you of those whom you #love# and i of those whom i #love#
you must #love# somebody no i am alone in the #world# then you #will# #love# me if you are young i #will# be your comrade if you are old i #will# be your #son#
i have a #father# who is seventy if he yet #life# i only #love# him and a young #girl# called $mercédès$
my #father# has not yet forgotten me i am sure but god alone knows if she loves me still i shall #love# you as i loved my #father#
these few #word# were uttered with an accent that left no #doubt# of his sincerity $m_dantès$ rose dispersed the fragments with the same precaution as before and pushed his #bed# back against the #wall#
it is well returned the #voice# #tomorrow# he then gave himself up to his #happiness# he would no longer be alone
he was perhaps about to regain his #liberty# at the worst he would have a #companion# and captivity that is shared is but #half# captivity
plaints made in common are almost prayers and prayers where two or three are gathered together invoke the mercy of heaven
all #day# $m_dantès$ walked up and down his cell he sat down occasionally on his #bed# pressing his #hand# on his #heart#
once or twice the #thought# crossed his #mind# that he might be separated from this unknown whom he loved already and then his #mind# was made up when the #jailer# moved his #bed# and stooped to examine the #opening# he would kill him with his #water# jug
he would be condemned to die but he was about to die of #grief# and #despair# when this miraculous #noise# recalled him to #life#
at the slightest #noise# he bounded towards the #door# the #jailer# came in the #evening# $m_dantès$ was on his #bed# it seemed to him that thus he better guarded the unfinished #opening#
doubtless there was a strange #expression# in his #eye# for the #jailer# said come are you going mad again $m_dantès$ did not #answer# he feared that the #emotion# of his #voice# would betray him
the #jailer# went away shaking his #head# #night# came $m_dantès$ hoped that his neighbor would profit by the #silence# to address him but he was mistaken
the next #morning# however just as he removed his #bed# from the #wall# he heard three knocks he threw himself on his knees
is it you said he i am here is your #jailer# gone yes said $m_dantès$
he #will# not #return# until the #evening# so that we have twelve #hour# before us i can #work# then said the #voice#
in a #moment# that #part# of the #floor# on which $m_dantès$ was resting his two #hand# as he knelt with his #head# in the #opening# suddenly gave #way# he drew back smartly while a mass of #stone# and #earth# disappeared in a hole that opened beneath the aperture he himself had formed
then from the bottom of this passage the depth of which it was impossible to measure he saw appear first the #head# then the #shoulder# and lastly the #body# of a #man# who sprang lightly into his cell
a learned italian seizing in his #arm# the #friend# so long and ardently desired $m_dantès$ almost carried him towards the #window# in #order# to obtain a better view of his #feature# by the aid of the imperfect #light# that struggled through the grating
oh yes yes this #instant# i entreat you #chapter# he was a #man# of small stature with #hair# blanched rather by suffering and sorrow than by #age#
he had a deep set penetrating #eye# almost buried beneath the thick gray eyebrow and a long and still black beard reaching down to his breast
his thin #face# deeply furrowed by #care# and the bold outline of his strongly marked #feature# betokened a #man# more accustomed to exercise his mental faculties than his physical #strength#
large drops of perspiration were now standing on his #brow# while the garments that hung about him were so ragged that #one# could only guess at the pattern upon which they had originally been fashioned
the #stranger# might have numbered sixty or sixty five #year# but a certain briskness and #appearance# of vigor in his movements made it probable that he was aged more from captivity than the #course# of #time#
he received the enthusiastic greeting of his young acquaintance with evident #pleasure# as though his chilled affections were rekindled and invigorated by his contact with #one# so warm and ardent
he thanked him with grateful cordiality for his kindly welcome although he must at that #moment# have been suffering bitterly to find another dungeon where he had fondly reckoned on discovering a #mean# of regaining his #liberty#
let us first see said he whether it is possible to remove the traces of my entrance here our future tranquillity depends upon our #jailer# being entirely ignorant of it
advancing to the #opening# he stooped and raised the #stone# easily in #spite# of its weight then fitting it into its #place# he said
you removed this #stone# very carelessly but i suppose you had no tools to aid you why exclaimed $m_dantès$ with #astonishment# do you possess any
i made myself some and with the exception of a file i have all that are necessary a chisel pincers and lever
oh how i should like to see these products of your industry and patience
well in the first #place# here is my chisel so saying he displayed a sharp strong blade with a handle made of beechwood
with #one# of the clamps of my bedstead and this very tool has sufficed me to hollow out the #road# by which i came hither a #distance# of about fifty #foot#
and with what did you contrive to make that inquired $m_dantès$ fifty #foot# responded $m_dantès$ almost terrified
it frequently occurs in a state #prison# like this that #person# are stationed outside the #door# of the cells purposely to overhear the #conversation# of the #prisoner#
do not speak so loud young #man# dont speak so loud but they believe i am shut up alone here
that makes no difference and you say that you dug your #way# a #distance# of fifty #foot# to get here
i do that is about the #distance# that separates your #chamber# from mine only unfortunately i did not curve aright for want of the necessary geometrical instruments to calculate my scale of proportion instead of taking an ellipsis of forty #foot# i made it fifty
i expected as i told you to reach the outer #wall# pierce through it and throw myself into the #sea# i have however kept along the corridor on which your #chamber# opens instead of going beneath it
my labor is all in vain for i find that the corridor #look# into a courtyard filled with #soldier#
that true said $m_dantès$ but the corridor you speak of only bounds #one# #side# of my cell there are three #other#
this #one# is built against the solid #rock# and it would take ten experienced miners duly furnished with the requisite tools as many #year# to perforate it
this adjoins the lower #part# of the #governor# #apartment# and were we to #work# our #way# through we should only get into some lock up cellars where we must necessarily be recaptured
do you know #anything# of their situation the fourth and last #side# of your cell #face# on #face# on stop a #minute# now where does it #face#
the #wall# of which he spoke was the #one# in which was fixed the loophole by which #light# was admitted to the #chamber#
this loophole which gradually diminished in size as it approached the outside to an #opening# through which a #child# could not have passed was for better security furnished with three #iron# bars so as to quiet all apprehensions even in the #mind# of the most suspicious #jailer# as to the possibility of a #prisoner# escape
as the #stranger# asked the #question# he dragged the #table# beneath the #window# climb up said he to $m_dantès$
the young #man# obeyed mounted on the #table# and divining the #wish# of his #companion# placed his back securely against the #wall# and held out both #hand#
the #stranger# whom as yet $m_dantès$ knew only by the number of his cell sprang up with an agility by no #mean# to be expected in a #person# of his #year# and #light# and steady on his #foot# as a cat or a lizard climbed from the #table# to the outstretched #hand# of $m_dantès$ and from them to his #shoulder# then bending double for the ceiling of the dungeon prevented him from holding himself erect he managed to slip his #head# between the upper bars of the #window# so as to be able to command a perfect view from top to bottom
i #thought# so and sliding from the #shoulder# of $m_dantès$ as dextrously as he had ascended he nimbly leaped from the #table# to the #ground#
an #instant# afterwards he hastily drew back his #head# saying what was it that you #thought# asked the young #man# anxiously in his #turn# descending from the #table#
this #side# of your #chamber# #look# out upon a kind of open gallery where patrols are continually passing and sentries keep watch #day# and #night#
the elder #prisoner# pondered the #matter# yes said he at #length# it is so are you quite sure of that
certain i saw the #soldier# shape and the top of his musket that made me draw in my #head# so quickly for i was fearful he might also see me
well inquired $m_dantès$ you perceive then the utter impossibility of escaping through your dungeon then pursued the young #man# eagerly
then answered the elder #prisoner# the #will# of god be done and as the old #man# slowly pronounced those #word# an #air# of profound resignation spread itself over his careworn #countenance#
$m_dantès$ gazed on the #man# who could thus philosophically resign #hope# so long and ardently nourished with an #astonishment# mingled with admiration
tell me i entreat of you who and what you are said he at #length# never have i met with so remarkable a #person# as yourself
willingly answered the #stranger# if indeed you feel any curiosity respecting #one# now alas powerless to aid you in any #way#
say not so you can console and support me by the #strength# of your own powerful #mind#
pray let me know who you really are the #stranger# smiled a melancholy #smile# then listen said he
i am the $abbé_faria$ and have been imprisoned as you know in this château if since the #year# previously to which i had been confined for three #year# in the fortress of fenestrelle
i learned that the destiny which seemed subservient to every #wish# formed by $napoleon$ had bestowed on him a #son# named #king# of rome even in his cradle
i was very far then from expecting the change you have just informed me of namely that four #year# afterwards this colossus of #power# would be overthrown
in the #year# i was transferred to piedmont in france it was at this period then who reigns in france at this #moment# $napoleon$ ii
how inscrutable are the #way# of providence for what great and mysterious #purpose# has it pleased heaven to abase the #man# once so elevated and raise up him who was so abased
$m_dantès$ whole #attention# was riveted on a #man# who could thus forget his own #misfortune# while occupying himself with the destinies of #other#
no $louis_xviii$ the #brother# of $louis_xviii$ xvi yes yes continued he twill be the same as it was in england
after charles i cromwell after cromwell charles ii and then james ii and then some #son# in #law# or relation some prince of orange a stadtholder who becomes a #king#
ah my #friend# said the #abbé# turning towards $m_dantès$ and surveying him with the kindling gaze of a prophet you are young you #will# see all this come to pass
then new concessions to the #people# then a constitution then #liberty# probably if ever i get out of #prison#
replied $abbé_faria$ we are #prisoner# but i forget this sometimes and there are even #moment# when my mental vision transports me beyond these #wall# and i fancy myself at #liberty#
because in i dreamed of the very #plan# $napoleon$ tried to realize in because like machiavelli i desired to alter the political #face# of italy and instead of allowing it to be split up into a quantity of petty principalities each held by some weak or tyrannical ruler i sought to form #one# large compact and powerful empire and lastly because i fancied i had found my $cæsar_borgia$ in a crowned simpleton who feigned to enter into my views only to betray me
true but wherefore are you here it was the #plan# of alexander vi and clement vii
but it #will# never succeed now for they attempted it fruitlessly and $napoleon$ was unable to complete his #work# italy seems fated to #misfortune#
and the old #man# bowed his #head# $m_dantès$ could not understand a #man# risking his #life# for such #matter# $napoleon$ certainly he knew #something# of inasmuch as he had seen and spoken with him but of clement vii
and alexander vi he knew #nothing# are you not he asked the #priest# who here in the château if is generally #thought# to be ill
well then resumed $abbé_faria$ with a bitter #smile# let me #answer# your #question# in full by acknowledging that i am the poor mad #prisoner# of the château if for many #year# permitted to amuse the different visitors with what is said to be my insanity and in all probability i should be promoted to the #honor# of making sport for the #child# if such innocent beings could be found in an abode devoted like this to suffering and #despair#
mad you #mean# dont you i did not like to say so answered $m_dantès$ smiling $m_dantès$ remained for a short #time# mute and motionless at #length# he said
then you abandon all #hope# of escape i perceive its utter impossibility and i consider it impious to attempt that which the almighty evidently does not approve
nay be not discouraged would it not be expecting too much to #hope# to succeed at your first attempt
alas it shows how little notion you can have of all it has cost me to #effect# a #purpose# so unexpectedly frustrated that you talk of beginning over again
in the first #place# i was four #year# making the tools i possess and have been two #year# scraping and digging out #earth# hard as granite itself then what toil and fatigue has it not been to remove huge #stone# i should once have deemed impossible to loosen
whole #day# have i passed in these titanic #effort# considering my labor well repaid if by #night# #time# i had contrived to carry away a square inch of this hard bound cement changed by #age# into a substance unyielding as the #stone# themselves then to conceal the mass of #earth# and rubbish
i dug up i was compelled to break through a #staircase# and throw the fruits of my labor into the hollow #part# of it but the well is now so completely choked up that i scarcely think it would be possible to add another handful of dust without leading to discovery
consider also that i fully believed i had accomplished the #end# and aim of my undertaking for which i had so exactly husbanded my #strength# as to make it just hold out to the termination of my enterprise and now at the #moment# when i reckoned upon success my #hope# are forever dashed from me
why not try to find an #opening# in another direction from that which has so unfortunately failed no i repeat again that #nothing# shall induce me to renew attempts evidently at variance with the almighty #pleasure#
$m_dantès$ held down his #head# that the #other# might not see how #joy# at the #thought# of having a #companion# outweighed the sympathy he felt for the failure of the #abbé# #plan#
the #abbé# sank upon $edmond_dantès$ #bed# while $edmond_dantès$ himself remained standing escape had never once occurred to him there are indeed some #thing# which appear so impossible that the #mind# does not dwell on them for an #instant#
to undermine the #ground# for fifty #foot# to devote three #year# to a labor which if successful would conduct you to a precipice overhanging the #sea# to plunge into the waves from the height of fifty sixty perhaps a hundred #foot# at the risk of being dashed to #piece# against the #rock# should you have been fortunate enough to have escaped the #fire# of the sentinels and even supposing all these perils past then to have to swim for your #life# a #distance# of at least three miles ere you could reach the shore were difficulties so startling and formidable that $m_dantès$ had never even dreamed of such a scheme resigning himself rather to #death#
but the #sight# of an old #man# clinging to #life# with so desperate a courage gave a fresh #turn# to his #idea# and inspired him with new courage
another older and less strong than he had attempted what he had not had sufficient resolution to undertake and had failed only because of an error in calculation
this same #person# with almost incredible patience and perseverance had contrived to provide himself with tools requisite for so unparalleled an attempt
$m_dantès$ would dig a hundred $abbé_faria$ at the #age# of fifty had devoted three #year# to the task he who was but #half# as old would sacrifice six $abbé_faria$ a #priest# and savant had not shrunk from the #idea# of risking his #life# by trying to swim a #distance# of three miles to #one# of the #island#
daume rattonneau or lemaire should a hardy #sailor# an experienced diver like himself shrink from a similar task should he who had so often for mere amusement sake plunged to the bottom of the #sea# to fetch up the bright coral branch hesitate to entertain the same project
he could do it in an #hour# and how many #time# had he for pure pastime continued in the #water# for more than twice as long
at once $m_dantès$ resolved to follow the brave example of his energetic #companion# and to remember that what has once been done may be done again
another had done all this why then was it impossible to $m_dantès$ $abbé_faria$ had dug his #way# through fifty #foot# after continuing some #time# in profound meditation the young #man# suddenly exclaimed
i have found what you were in search of $abbé_faria$ started have you indeed cried he raising his #head# with quick anxiety pray let me know what it is you have discovered
the corridor through which you have bored your #way# from the cell you occupy here extends in the same direction as the outer gallery does it not
it does and is not above fifteen #foot# from it about that
we must pierce through the corridor by forming a #side# #opening# about the middle as it were the top #part# of a cross
this #time# you #will# lay your #plan# more accurately we shall get out into the gallery you have described kill the sentinel who guards it and make our escape
all we require to insure success is courage and that you possess and #strength# which i am not deficient in as for patience you have abundantly proved yours
well then i #will# tell you what we must do you shall now see me prove mine #one# #instant# my dear #friend# replied the #abbé#
it is clear you do not understand the #nature# of the courage with which i am endowed and what #use# i intend making of my #strength#
as for patience i consider that i have abundantly exercised that in beginning every #morning# the task of the #night# before and every #night# renewing the task of the #day#
but then young #man# and i pray of you to give me your full #attention# then i #thought# i could not be doing #anything# displeasing to the almighty in trying to set an innocent being at #liberty#
and have your notions changed asked $m_dantès$ with much surprise do you think yourself more guilty in making the attempt since you have encountered me
#one# who had committed no offence and merited not condemnation no neither do i #wish# to incur guilt
i have #thought# it no sin to bore through a #wall# or destroy a #staircase# but i cannot so easily persuade myself to pierce a #heart# or take away a #life#
hitherto i have fancied myself merely waging war against #circumstance# not #man# a slight movement of surprise escaped $m_dantès$
is it possible said he that where your #liberty# is at stake you can allow any such scruple to deter you from obtaining it
tell me replied $abbé_faria$ what has hindered you from knocking down your #jailer# with a #piece# of wood torn from your bedstead dressing yourself in his clothes and endeavoring to escape
because said the old #man# the natural repugnance to the commission of such a #crime# prevented you from thinking of it and
so it ever is because in simple and allowable #thing# our natural instincts keep us from deviating from the strict #line# of #duty#
the tiger whose #nature# teaches him to delight in shedding #blood# needs but the sense of smell to show him when his prey is within his reach and by following this instinct he is enabled to measure the leap necessary to permit him to spring on his victim but #man# on the #contrary# loathes the #idea# of #blood#
it is not alone that the #law# of social #life# inspire him with a shrinking dread of taking #life# his natural construction and physiological formation
$m_dantès$ was confused and silent at this explanation of the #thought# which had unconsciously been working in his #mind# or rather soul for there are two distinct #sort# of #idea# those that proceed from the #head# and those that emanate from the #heart#
simply the #fact# that the #idea# never occurred to me answered $m_dantès$ since my imprisonment said $abbé_faria$
those that have been crowned with full success have been long meditated upon and carefully arranged such for instance as the escape of the duc de beaufort from the château de vincennes that of the #abbé# dubuquoi from for evêque of latude from the bastille
i have #thought# over all the most celebrated #case# of escape on record they have rarely been successful then there are those for which #chance# sometimes affords opportunity and those are the best of all
ah said $m_dantès$ you might well endure the tedious delay you were constantly employed in the task you set yourself and when weary with toil you had your #hope# to refresh and encourage you
let us therefore wait patiently for some favorable #moment# and when it presents itself profit by it
i assure you replied the old #man# i did not #turn# to that source for recreation or support
what did you do then i wrote or studied were you then permitted the #use# of pens ink and #paper#
oh no answered the #abbé# i had none but what i made for myself you made #paper# pens and ink
when you pay me a #visit# in my cell my young #friend# said he i #will# show you an entire #work# the fruits of the #thought# and reflections of my whole #life# many of them meditated over in the shades of the colosseum at rome at the #foot# of st mark column at venice and on the borders of the arno at florence little imagining at the #time# that they would be arranged in #order# within the #wall# of the château if
the #work# i speak of is called a treatise on the possibility of a general monarchy in italy and #will# make #one# large quarto volume
yes $m_dantès$ gazed with admiration but he had some difficulty in believing $abbé_faria$ saw this and on what have you written all this
on two of my shirts i invented a preparation that makes linen as smooth and as easy to write on as parchment
you are then a chemist somewhat i know lavoisier and was the intimate #friend# of cabanis
i had nearly five thousand volumes in my library at rome but after reading them over many #time# i found out that with #one# hundred and fifty well chosen books a #man# possesses if not a complete summary of all human knowledge at least all that a #man# need really know
i devoted three #year# of my #life# to reading and studying these #one# hundred and fifty volumes till i knew them nearly by #heart# so that since i have been in #prison# a very slight #effort# of memory has enabled me to recall their contents as readily as though the pages were open before me
i could recite you the whole of thucydides xenophon plutarch titus livius tacitus strada jornandes dante montaigne shakespeare spinoza machiavelli and bossuet
but for such a #work# you must have needed books had you any i #name# only the most important
you are doubtless acquainted with a variety of languages so as to have been able to read all these
yes i speak five of the modern tongues that is to say german french italian english and spanish by the aid of ancient greek i learned modern greek
i dont speak it so well as i could #wish# but i am still trying to improve myself improve yourself repeated $m_dantès$
why i made a vocabulary of the #word# i knew turned returned and arranged them so as to enable me to express my #thought# through their medium
i know nearly #one# thousand #word# which is all that is absolutely necessary although i believe there are nearly #one# hundred thousand in the dictionaries
i cannot #hope# to be very fluent but i certainly should have no difficulty in explaining my wants and #wish# and that would be quite as much as i should ever require
stronger grew the wonder of $m_dantès$ who almost fancied he had to do with #one# gifted with supernatural #power# still hoping to find some imperfection which might bring him down to a level with human beings he added
why how can you manage to do so then if you were not furnished with pens how did you manage to write the #work# you speak of
i made myself some excellent #one# which would be universally preferred to all #other# if once known you are aware what huge whitings are served to us on maigre #day#
well i selected the cartilages of the #head# of these fishes and you can scarcely imagine the delight with which i welcomed the arrival of each wednesday friday and saturday as affording me the #mean# of increasing my stock of pens for i #will# freely confess that my historical labors have been my greatest solace and relief
while retracing the past i forget the present and traversing at #will# the path of history i cease to remember that i am myself a #prisoner#
but the ink said $m_dantès$ of what did you make your ink there was formerly a fireplace in my dungeon replied $abbé_faria$
still it must have been many #year# in #use# for it was thickly covered with a coating of soot this soot i dissolved in a portion of the wine brought to me every sunday and i assure you a better ink cannot be desired
for very important #note# for which closer #attention# is required i pricked #one# of my #finger# and wrote with my own #blood#
but it was closed up long ere i became an occupant of this #prison# and when asked $m_dantès$ may i see all this
whenever you please replied the #abbé# oh then let it be directly exclaimed the young #man# follow me then said the #abbé# as he re entered the subterranean passage in which he soon disappeared followed by $m_dantès$
after having passed with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage which however did not admit of their holding themselves erect the two #friend# reached the further #end# of the corridor into which the #abbé# cell opened from that #point# the passage became much narrower and barely permitted #one# to creep through on #hand# and knees
the #floor# of the #abbé# cell was paved and it had been by raising #one# of the #stone# in the most obscure #corner# that $abbé_faria$ had been able to commence the laborious task of which $m_dantès$ had witnessed the completion
as he entered the #chamber# of his #friend# $m_dantès$ cast around #one# eager and searching #glance# in quest of the expected marvels but #nothing# more than common met his view
#chapter# the #abbé# #chamber# it is well said the #abbé# we have some #hour# before us it is now just a #quarter# past twelve clock
instinctively $m_dantès$ turned round to observe by what watch or clock the #abbé# had been able so accurately to specify the #hour#
#look# at this ray of #light# which enters by my #window# said the #abbé# and then observe the #line# traced on the #wall#
well by #mean# of these #line# which are in accordance with the double motion of the #earth# and the ellipse it describes round the sun i am enabled to ascertain the precise #hour# with more minuteness than if i possessed a watch for that might be broken or deranged in its movements while the sun and #earth# never vary in their appointed paths
this last explanation was wholly lost upon $m_dantès$ who had always imagined from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in the mediterranean that it moved and not the #earth#
a double movement of the globe he inhabited and of which he could feel #nothing# appeared to him perfectly impossible
each #word# that fell from his #companion# #lip# seemed fraught with the mysteries of science as worthy of digging out as the #gold# and #diamond# in the mines of guzerat and golconda which he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his earliest youth
the #abbé# smiled and proceeding to the disused fireplace raised by the help of his chisel a long #stone# which had doubtless been the hearth beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth serving as a safe depository of the articles mentioned to $m_dantès$
come said he to the #abbé# i am anxious to see your #treasure# what do you #wish# to see first
$abbé_faria$ then drew forth from his hiding #place# three or four rolls of linen laid #one# over the #other# like folds of papyrus
these rolls consisted of slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long they were all carefully numbered and closely covered with writing so legible that $m_dantès$ could easily read it as well as make out the sense
asked the #abbé# oh your great #work# on the monarchy of italy it being in italian a language he as a provençal perfectly understood
there said he there is the #work# complete i wrote the #word# finis at the #end# of the sixty eighth strip about a week ago
i have torn up two of my shirts and as many handkerchiefs as i was #master# of to complete the precious pages
should i ever get out of #prison# and find in all italy a printer courageous enough to publish what i have composed my literary reputation is forever secured
i see answered $m_dantès$ now let me behold the curious pens with which you have written your #work#
said $abbé_faria$ showing to the young #man# a slender stick about six inches long and much resembling the size of the handle of a fine painting brush to the #end# of which was tied by a #piece# of thread #one# of those cartilages of which the #abbé# had before spoken to $m_dantès$ it was pointed and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen
$m_dantès$ examined it with intense admiration then looked around to see the instrument with which it had been shaped so correctly into form
#look# ah yes said $abbé_faria$ the penknife that my masterpiece i made it as well as this larger knife out of an old #iron# candlestick
the penknife was sharp and keen as a razor as for the #other# knife it would serve a double #purpose# and with it #one# could cut and thrust
$m_dantès$ examined the various articles shown to him with the same #attention# that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the shops at marseilles as the #work# of the savages in the south seas from whence they had been brought by the different trading #vessel#
as for the ink said $abbé_faria$ i told you how i managed to obtain that and i only just make it from #time# to #time# as i require it
#one# #thing# still puzzles me observed $m_dantès$ and that is how you managed to do all this by daylight
i worked at #night# also replied $abbé_faria$ #night# why for heaven sake are your #eye# like cats that you can see to #work# in the dark
indeed they are not but god has supplied #man# with the intelligence that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions
i furnished myself with a #light# you did pray tell me how i separated the fat from the meat served to me melted it and so made oil
here is my lamp so saying the #abbé# exhibited a #sort# of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations
but how do you procure a #light# oh here are two flints and a #piece# of burnt linen
and matches i pretended that i had a disorder of the skin and asked for a little sulphur which was readily supplied
$m_dantès$ laid the different #thing# he had been looking at on the #table# and stood with his #head# drooping on his breast as though overwhelmed by the perseverance and #strength# of $abbé_faria$ #mind#
you have not seen all yet continued $abbé_faria$ for i did not think it wise to trust all my #treasure# in the same hiding #place#
they put the #stone# back in its #place# the #abbé# sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been removed rubbed his #foot# well on it to make it assume the same #appearance# as the #other# and then going towards his #bed# he removed it from the #spot# it stood in
behind the #head# of the #bed# and concealed by a #stone# fitting in so closely as to defy all suspicion was a hollow space and in this space a ladder of cords between twenty five and thirty #foot# in #length#
let us shut this #one# up $m_dantès$ closely and eagerly examined it he found it firm solid and compact enough to bear any weight
i tore up several of my shirts and ripped out the seams in the sheets of my #bed# during my three #year# imprisonment at fenestrelle and when i was removed to the château if i managed to bring the ravellings with me so that i have been able to finish my #work# here
who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful #work# and was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed
oh no for when i had taken out the thread i required i hemmed the edges over again
with this needle said the #abbé# as #opening# his ragged vestments he showed $m_dantès$ a long sharp fish bone with a small perforated #eye# for the thread a small portion of which still remained in it
i once #thought# continued $abbé_faria$ of removing these #iron# bars and letting myself down from the #window# which as you see is somewhat wider than yours although i should have enlarged it still more preparatory to my flight however i discovered that i should merely have dropped into a #sort# of inner #court# and i therefore renounced the project altogether as too full of risk and danger
nevertheless i carefully preserved my ladder against #one# of those unforeseen opportunities of which i spoke just now and which sudden #chance# frequently brings about
while affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder the #mind# of $m_dantès$ was in #fact# busily occupied by the #idea# that a #person# so intelligent ingenious and clear sighted as the #abbé# might probably be able to solve the dark mystery of his own #misfortune# where he himself could see #nothing#
asked the #abbé# smilingly imputing the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his awe and wonder
i was reflecting in the first #place# replied $m_dantès$ upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained
with what what are you thinking of what would you not have accomplished if you had been free
would probably in a state of freedom have evaporated in a thousand follies #misfortune# is needed to bring to #light# the #treasure# of the human intellect
captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus and you are well aware that from the collision of clouds electricity is produced from electricity lightning from lightning illumination
possibly #nothing# at all the overflow of my brain compression is needed to explode gunpowder no replied $m_dantès$
i know #nothing# some of your #word# are to me quite empty of meaning you must be blessed indeed to possess the knowledge you have
the #abbé# smiled well said he but you had another #subject# for your #thought# did you not say so just now
i did you have told me as yet but #one# of them let me hear the #other#
it was this that while you had related to me all the particulars of your past #life# you were perfectly unacquainted with mine
your #life# my young #friend# has not been of sufficient #length# to admit of your having passed through any very important #event#
it has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved #misfortune# i would fain fix the source of it on #man# that i may no longer vent reproaches upon heaven
then you profess ignorance of the #crime# with which you are charged i do indeed and this i swear by the two beings most dear to me upon
come said the #abbé# closing his hiding #place# and pushing the #bed# back to its original situation let me hear your #story#
$m_dantès$ obeyed and commenced what he called his history but which consisted only of the #account# of a voyage to india and two or three voyages to the levant until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise with the #death# of #captain# $leclere$ and the receipt of a packet to be delivered by himself to the grand marshal
his interview with that personage and his receiving in #place# of the packet brought a #letter# addressed to a $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ his arrival at marseilles and interview with his #father# his affection for $mercédès$ and their nuptual feast his arrest and subsequent examination his temporary detention at the palais de #justice# and his final imprisonment in the château if
#earth# my #father# and $mercédès$ from this #point# #everything# was a blank to $m_dantès$ he knew #nothing# more not even the #length# of #time# he had been imprisoned
there is said he at the #end# of his meditations a clever maxim which bears upon what i was saying to you some little while ago and that is that unless wicked #idea# take root in a naturally depraved #mind# human #nature# in a #right# and wholesome state revolts at #crime#
still from an artificial civilization have originated wants vices and false tastes which occasionally become so powerful as to stifle within us all good #feeling# and ultimately to lead us into guilt and wickedness
from this view of #thing# then comes the axiom that if you #visit# to discover the author of any bad action seek first to discover the #person# to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any #way# advantageous
his recital finished the #abbé# reflected long and earnestly now to apply it in your #case# to whom could your disappearance have been serviceable
do not speak thus for your reply evinces neither logic nor philosophy #everything# is relative my dear young #friend# from the #king# who stands in the #way# of his successor to the employee who keeps his rival out of a #place#
now in the #event# of the #king# #death# his successor inherits a crown when the employee dies the supernumerary #step# into his shoes and receives his salary of twelve thousand livres
well these twelve thousand livres are his civil list and are as essential to him as the twelve #million# of a #king#
#everyone# from the highest to the lowest degree has his #place# on the social ladder and is beset by stormy passions and conflicting #interest# as in descartes theory of pressure and impulsion
but these forces increase as we go higher so that we have a spiral which in defiance of #reason# rests upon the apex and not on the base
to no #one# by heaven i was a very insignificant #person# now let us #return# to your particular #world#
you say you were on the #point# of being made #captain# of the $pharaon$ yes and about to become the #husband# of a young and lovely #girl#
but let us first settle the #question# as to its being the #interest# of #anyone# to hinder you from being #captain# of the $pharaon$
yes now could #anyone# have had any #interest# in preventing the accomplishment of these two #thing# what say you
i cannot believe such was the #case# i was generally liked on #board# and had the #sailor# possessed the #right# of selecting a #captain# themselves
i feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me there was only #one# #person# among the crew who had any #feeling# of ill #will# towards me
i had quarelled with him some #time# previously and had even challenged him to fight me but he refused
now we are getting on and what was this #man# #name# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ what rank did he hold on #board#
he was supercargo and had you been #captain# should you have retained him in his employment
not if the choice had remained with me for i had frequently observed inaccuracies in his #account# good again now then tell me was any #person# present during your last #conversation# with #captain# $leclere$
it might for the cabin #door# was open and stay now i recollect $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ himself passed by just as #captain# $leclere$ was giving me the packet for the grand marshal
no we were quite alone could your #conversation# have been overheard by #anyone# that better cried the #abbé# now we are on the #right# scent
did you take anybody with you when you put into the port of $elba$ nobody somebody there received your packet and gave you a #letter# in #place# of it i think
yes the grand marshal did and what did you do with that #letter# put it into my portfolio
you had your portfolio with you then now how could a #sailor# find #room# in his #pocket# for a portfolio large enough to contain an official #letter#
you are #right# it was left on #board# then it was not till your #return# to the ship that you put the #letter# in the portfolio
no and what did you do with this same #letter# while returning from porto ferrajo to the #vessel#
so that when you went on #board# the $pharaon$ everybody could see that you held a #letter# in your #hand#
i carried it in my #hand# yes $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ as well as the #rest# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ as well as #other#
now listen to me and try to recall every #circumstance# attending your arrest do you recollect the #word# in which the information against you was formulated
oh yes i read it over three #time# and the #word# sank deeply into my memory repeat it to me
the #king# attorney is informed by a #friend# to the throne and religion that #one# $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ mate on #board# the $pharaon$ this #day# arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo has been intrusted by murat with a packet for the usurper again by the usurper with a #letter# for the bonapartist club in paris
this #proof# of his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest as the #letter# #will# be found either about his #person# at his #father#
$m_dantès$ paused a #moment# then said this is it #word# for #word# residence or in his cabin on #board# the $pharaon$
and you must have had a very confiding #nature# as well as a good #heart# not to have suspected the origin of the whole #affair#
the #abbé# shrugged his #shoulder# the #thing# is clear as #day# said he do you really think so
ah that would indeed be infamous how did $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ usually write in a handsome running #hand#
and how was the anonymous #letter# written backhanded again the #abbé# smiled disguised it was very boldly written if disguised
stop a bit said the #abbé# taking up what he called his pen and after dipping it into the ink he wrote on a #piece# of prepared linen with his left #hand# the first two or three #word# of the accusation
$m_dantès$ drew back and gazed on the #abbé# with a sensation almost amounting to #terror# how very astonishing cried he at #length#
why your writing exactly resembles that of the accusation simply because that accusation had been written with the left #hand# and i have noticed that
that while the writing of different #person# done with the #right# #hand# varies that performed with the left #hand# is invariably uniform
what you have evidently seen and observed #everything# let us proceed oh yes yes
now as regards the second #question# i am listening was there any #person# whose #interest# it was to prevent your #marriage# with $mercédès$
yes a young #man# who loved her and his #name# was $m_fernand_mondego$ that is a spanish #name# i think
he was a catalan you imagine him capable of writing the #letter# oh no he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife into me
that is in strict accordance with the spanish character an assassination they #will# unhesitatingly commit but an act of cowardice never
besides said $m_dantès$ the various #circumstance# mentioned in the #letter# were wholly unknown to him you had never spoken of them yourself to #anyone#
to no #one# not even to your mistress no not even to my betrothed
then it is $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i feel quite sure of it now wait a little pray was $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ acquainted with $m_fernand_mondego$
to have seen them both sitting at #table# together under an arbor at père pamphile the #evening# before the #day# fixed for my wedding
no yes he was now i recollect what they were in earnest #conversation# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was joking in a friendly #way# but $m_fernand_mondego$ looked pale and agitated
there was a third #person# with them whom i knew perfectly well and who had in all probability made their acquaintance he was a tailor named $m_caderousse$ but he was very drunk
were they alone stay stay how strange that it should not have occurred to me before now i remember quite well that on the #table# round which they were sitting were pens ink and #paper#
is there #anything# else i can assist you in discovering besides the villany of your #friend# inquired the #abbé# with a laugh
yes yes replied $m_dantès$ eagerly i would beg of you who see so completely to the depths of #thing# and to whom the greatest mystery seems but an easy riddle to explain to me how it was that i underwent no second examination was never brought to trial and above all was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me
oh the heartless treacherous scoundrels exclaimed $m_dantès$ pressing his #hand# to his throbbing #brow# that is altogether a different and more serious #matter# responded the #abbé#
the #way# of #justice# are frequently too dark and mysterious to be easily penetrated all we have hitherto done in the #matter# has been #child# play
if you #wish# me to enter upon the more difficult #part# of the #business# you must assist me by the most #minute# information on every #point#
pray ask me whatever #question# you please for in good #truth# you see more clearly into my #life# than i do myself
in the first #place# then who examined you the #king# attorney his deputy or a #magistrate# the deputy
was he young or old about six or seven and twenty #year# of #age# i should say so answered the #abbé#
old enough to be ambitious but too young to be corrupt and how did he treat you with more of mildness than severity
did you tell him your whole #story# i did and did his conduct change at all in the #course# of your examination
he did appear much disturbed when he read the #letter# that had brought me into this scrape he seemed quite overcome by my #misfortune#
by your #misfortune# yes then you feel quite sure that it was your #misfortune# he deplored
he gave me #one# great #proof# of his sympathy at any rate and that he burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me
what the accusation no the #letter# are you sure i saw it done that alters the #case#
this #man# might after all be a greater scoundrel than you have #thought# possible upon my #word# said $m_dantès$ you make me shudder
is the #world# filled with tigers and crocodiles yes and remember that two legged tigers and crocodiles are more dangerous than the #other#
never #mind# let us go on with all my #heart# you tell me he burned the #letter#
he did saying at the same #time# you see i thus destroy the only #proof# existing against you
this action is somewhat too sublime to be natural you think so i am sure of it
now can you conceive of any #interest# that your heroic deputy could possibly have had in the destruction of that #letter#
why it is not altogether impossible he might have had for he made me #promise# several #time# never to speak of that #letter# to #anyone# assuring me he so advised me for my own #interest# and more than this he insisted on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the #name# mentioned in the address
to whom was this #letter# addressed to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ rue coq héron no paris $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
repeated the #abbé# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i knew a #person# of that #name# at the #court# of the queen of etruria a $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who had been a girondin during the revolution
what was your deputy called $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the #abbé# burst into a fit of laughter while $m_dantès$ gazed on him in utter #astonishment#
what ails you said he at #length# do you see that ray of sunlight i do
well the whole #thing# is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to you poor #fellow# poor young #man#
and you tell me this #magistrate# expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you he did and the worthy #man# destroyed your compromising #letter#
yes and then made you swear never to utter the #name# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ yes
why you poor short sighted simpleton can you not guess who this $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was whose very #name# he was so careful to keep concealed
had a thunderbolt fallen at the #foot# of $m_dantès$ or hell opened its yawning gulf before him he could not have been more completely transfixed with horror than he was at the #sound# of these unexpected #word#
starting up he clasped his #hand# around his #head# as though to prevent his very brain from bursting and exclaimed his #father#
this $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was his #father# his #father# yes his #father# replied the #abbé# his #right# #name# was $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
at this #instant# a bright #light# shot through the #mind# of $m_dantès$ and cleared up all that had been dark and obscure before
the change that had come over $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ during the examination the destruction of the #letter# the exacted #promise# the almost supplicating #tone# of the #magistrate# who seemed rather to implore mercy than to pronounce punishment all returned with a stunning force to his memory
he cried out and staggered against the #wall# like a drunken #man# then he hurried to the #opening# that led from the #abbé# cell to his own and said i must be alone to think over all this
when he regained his dungeon he threw himself on his #bed# where the turnkey found him in the #evening# #visit# sitting with fixed gaze and contracted #feature# dumb and motionless as a statue
during these #hour# of profound meditation which to him had seemed only #minute# he had formed a fearful resolution and bound himself to its fulfilment by a solemn oath
$m_dantès$ was at #length# roused from his reverie by the #voice# of $abbé_faria$ who having also been visited by his #jailer# had come to invite his #fellow# sufferer to share his supper
the reputation of being out of his #mind# though harmlessly and even amusingly so had procured for the #abbé# unusual privileges
he was supplied with bread of a finer whiter quality than the usual #prison# fare and even regaled each sunday with a small quantity of wine
now this was a sunday and the #abbé# had come to ask his young #companion# to share the luxuries with him
$m_dantès$ followed him his #feature# were no longer contracted and now wore their usual #expression# but there was that in his whole #appearance# that bespoke #one# who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve
$abbé_faria$ bent on him his penetrating #eye# i regret now said he having helped you in your late inquiries or having given you the information i did
why so inquired $m_dantès$ because it has instilled a new passion in your #heart# that of vengeance
again the #abbé# looked at him then mournfully shook his #head# but in accordance with $m_dantès$ request he began to speak of #other# #matter#
the elder #prisoner# was #one# of those #person# whose #conversation# like that of all who have experienced many trials contained many useful and important hints as well as #sound# information but it was never egotistical for the unfortunate #man# never alluded to his own sorrows
$m_dantès$ listened with admiring #attention# to all he said some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew or applied to the #sort# of knowledge his nautical #life# had enabled him to acquire
a #part# of the good #abbé# #word# however were wholly incomprehensible to him but like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes opened new vistas to the inquiring #mind# of the listener and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual #mind# would have in following #one# so richly gifted as $abbé_faria$ along the heights of #truth# where he was so much at home
you must teach me a small #part# of what you know said $m_dantès$ if only to prevent your growing weary of me
i can well believe that so learned a #person# as yourself would prefer absolute solitude to being tormented with the company of #one# as ignorant and uninformed as myself
$m_dantès$ smiled let us talk of #something# else said he if you #will# only agree to my request i #promise# you never to mention another #word# about escaping
alas my #boy# said he human knowledge is confined within very narrow limits and when i have taught you mathematics physics history and the three or four modern languages with which i am acquainted you #will# know as much as i do myself
the #abbé# smiled now it #will# scarcely require two #year# for me to communicate to you the stock of learning i possess
two #year# exclaimed $m_dantès$ do you really believe i can acquire all these #thing# in so short a #time#
not their application certainly but their principles you may to learn is not to know there are the learners and the learned
philosophy cannot be taught it is the application of the sciences to #truth# it is like the golden cloud in which the messiah went up into heaven
memory makes the #one# philosophy the #other# but cannot #one# learn philosophy well then said $m_dantès$
what shall you teach me first i am in a hurry to begin i want to learn #everything# said the #abbé#
$m_dantès$ possessed a prodigious memory combined with an astonishing quickness and readiness of conception the mathematical #turn# of his #mind# rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation while his naturally poetical #feeling# threw a #light# and pleasing veil over the dry reality of arithmetical computation or the rigid severity of geometry
he already knew italian and had also picked up a little of the romaic dialect during voyages to the east and by the aid of these two languages he easily comprehended the construction of all the #other# so that at the #end# of six #month# he began to speak spanish english and german
and that very #evening# the #prisoner# sketched a #plan# of education to be entered upon the following #day# in strict accordance with the #promise# made to the #abbé# $m_dantès$ spoke no more of escape
perhaps the delight his #study# afforded him left no #room# for such #thought# perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his #word# on which his sense of #honor# was keen kept him from referring in any #way# to the possibilities of flight
#day# even #month# passed by unheeded in #one# rapid and instructive #course# at the #end# of a #year# $m_dantès$ was a new #man#
$m_dantès$ observed however that $abbé_faria$ in #spite# of the relief his society afforded daily grew sadder #one# #thought# seemed incessantly to harass and distract his #mind#
sometimes he would fall into long reveries sigh heavily and involuntarily then suddenly rise and with folded #arm# begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon
there shall not be #one# a #minute# longer than you please said $m_dantès$ who had followed the working of his #thought# as accurately as though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its minutest operations
#one# #day# he stopped all at once and exclaimed ah if there were no sentinel i have already told you answered the #abbé# that i loathe the #idea# of shedding #blood#
and yet the murder if you choose to call it so would be simply a measure of self preservation
no #matter# i could never agree to it still you have #thought# of it incessantly alas
cried the #abbé# and you have discovered a #mean# of regaining our freedom have you not asked $m_dantès$ eagerly
i have if it were only possible to #place# a deaf and blind sentinel in the gallery beyond us
he shall be both blind and deaf replied the young #man# with an #air# of determination that made his #companion# shudder
$m_dantès$ endeavored to renew the #subject# the #abbé# shook his #head# in token of disapproval and refused to make any further response
no no cried the #abbé# impossible three #month# passed away are you strong the #abbé# asked #one# #day# of $m_dantès$
the young #man# in reply took up the chisel bent it into the form of a horseshoe and then as readily straightened it
and #will# you engage not to do any harm to the sentry except as a last resort i #promise# on my #honor#
then said the #abbé# we may #hope# to put our design into execution and how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary #work#
at least a #year# and shall we begin at once at once we have lost a #year# to no #purpose# cried $m_dantès$
do you consider the last twelve #month# to have been wasted asked the #abbé# forgive me cried $edmond_dantès$ blushing deeply
answered the #abbé# #man# is but #man# after all and you are about the best specimen of the genus i have ever known
tut tut come let me show you my #plan# the #abbé# then showed $m_dantès$ the sketch he had made for their escape
in this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines this level would bring the two #prisoner# immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry kept watch once there a large excavation would be made and #one# of the flag #stone# with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened that at the desired #moment# it would give #way# beneath the #foot# of the #soldier# who stunned by his fall would be immediately bound and gagged by $m_dantès$ before he had #power# to offer any resistance
the #prisoner# were then to make their #way# through #one# of the gallery #window# and to let themselves down from the outer #wall# by #mean# of the #abbé# ladder of cords
$m_dantès$ #eye# sparkled with #joy# and he rubbed his #hand# with delight at the #idea# of a #plan# so simple yet apparently so certain to succeed
that very #day# the miners began their labors with a vigor and alacrity proportionate to their long #rest# from fatigue and their #hope# of ultimate success
#nothing# interrupted the progress of the #work# except the necessity that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the turnkey #visit#
they had learned to distinguish the almost imperceptible #sound# of his footsteps as he descended towards their dungeons and happily never failed of being prepared for his coming
the fresh #earth# excavated during their present #work# and which would have entirely blocked up the old passage was thrown by degrees and with the utmost precaution out of the #window# in either $abbé_faria$ or $m_dantès$ cell the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the #night# wind carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain
more than a #year# had been consumed in this undertaking the only tools for which had been a chisel a knife and a wooden lever $abbé_faria$ still continuing to instruct $m_dantès$ by conversing with him sometimes in #one# language sometimes in another at #other# relating to him the history of nations and great #man# who from #time# to #time# have risen to fame and trodden the path of glory
the #abbé# was a #man# of the #world# and had moreover mixed in the first society of the #day# he wore an #air# of melancholy dignity which $m_dantès$ #thank# to the imitative #power# bestowed on him by #nature# easily acquired as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting in and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in constant intercourse with #person# of high birth and breeding
at the #end# of fifteen #month# the level was finished and the excavation completed beneath the gallery and the two workmen could distinctly hear the measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their #head#
compelled as they were to await a #night# sufficiently dark to favor their flight they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that auspicious #moment# should arrive their greatest dread now was lest the #stone# through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give #way# before its #right# #time# and this they had in some measure provided against by propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the #wall# through which they had worked their #way#
$m_dantès$ was occupied in arranging this #piece# of wood when he heard $abbé_faria$ who had remained in $edmond_dantès$ cell for the #purpose# of cutting a peg to secure their rope ladder call to him in a #tone# indicative of great suffering
$m_dantès$ hastened to his dungeon where he found him standing in the middle of the #room# pale as #death# his #forehead# streaming with perspiration and his #hand# clenched tightly together
it consisted of a #plan# of his own cell and that of $m_dantès$ with the passage which united them gracious heavens
exclaimed $m_dantès$ what is the #matter# what has happened quick quick returned the #abbé# listen to what i have to say
$m_dantès$ looked in #fear# and wonder at the livid #countenance# of $abbé_faria$ whose #eye# already dull and sunken were surrounded by purple circles while his #lip# were white as those of a corpse and his very #hair# seemed to stand on #end#
tell me i beseech you what ails you cried $m_dantès$ letting his chisel fall to the #floor# alas faltered out the #abbé# all is over with me
i am seized with a terrible perhaps mortal illness i can feel that the paroxysm is fast approaching i had a similar attack the #year# previous to my imprisonment
go into my cell as quickly as you can draw out #one# of the #foot# that support the #bed# you #will# find it has been hollowed out for the #purpose# of containing a small phial you #will# see there #half# filled with a red looking fluid
no no i may be found here therefore help me back to my #room# while i have the #strength# to drag myself along
this malady admits but of #one# remedy i #will# tell you what that is bring it to me or rather who knows what may happen or how long the attack may last
in #spite# of the magnitude of the #misfortune# which thus suddenly frustrated his #hope# $m_dantès$ did not lose his #presence# of #mind# but descended into the passage dragging his unfortunate #companion# with him then #half# carrying #half# supporting him he managed to reach the #abbé# #chamber# when he immediately laid the sufferer on his #bed#
i am about to be seized with a fit of catalepsy when it comes to its height i shall probably lie still and motionless as though dead uttering neither sigh nor groan
on the #other# #hand# the symptoms may be much more violent and cause me to fall into fearful convulsions foam at the mouth and #cry# out loudly
take #care# my #cry# are not heard for if they are it is more than probable i should be removed to another #part# of the #prison# and we be separated forever
when i become quite motionless cold and rigid as a corpse then and not before be careful about this force open my teeth with the knife pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial down my throat and i may perhaps revive
#thank# said the poor #abbé# shivering as though his veins were filled with ice perhaps exclaimed $m_dantès$ in #grief# stricken #tone#
so sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate #prisoner# was unable to complete the sentence a violent convulsion shook his whole frame his #eye# started from their sockets his mouth was drawn on #one# #side# his cheeks became purple he struggled foamed dashed himself about and uttered the most dreadful #cry# which however $m_dantès$ prevented from being heard by covering his #head# with the blanket
the fit lasted two #hour# then more helpless than an infant and colder and paler than marble more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under #foot# he fell back doubled up in #one# last convulsion and became as rigid as a corpse
$edmond_dantès$ waited till #life# seemed extinct in the #body# of his #friend# then taking up the knife he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed jaws carefully administered the appointed number of drops and anxiously awaited the result
help help cried the #abbé# i i die i an #hour# passed away and the old #man# gave no #sign# of returning animation
ere he administered the remedy and thrusting his #hand# into his #hair# continued gazing on the lifeless #feature# of his #friend#
at #length# a slight color tinged the livid cheeks consciousness returned to the dull open eyeballs a faint sigh issued from the #lip# and the sufferer made a feeble #effort# to move
$m_dantès$ began to #fear# he had delayed too long he is saved he is saved cried $m_dantès$ in a paroxysm of delight
the sick #man# was not yet able to speak but he pointed with evident anxiety towards the #door# $m_dantès$ listened and plainly distinguished the approaching #step# of the #jailer#
the young #man# sprang to the entrance darted through it carefully #drawing# the #stone# over the #opening# and hurried to his cell
he had scarcely done so before the #door# opened and the #jailer# saw the #prisoner# seated as usual on the #side# of his #bed#
almost before the key had turned in the lock and before the departing #step# of the #jailer# had died away in the long corridor he had to traverse $m_dantès$ whose restless anxiety concerning his #friend# left him no #desire# to touch the food brought him hurried back to the #abbé# #chamber# and raising the #stone# by pressing his #head# against it was soon beside the sick #man#
it was therefore near seven clock but $edmond_dantès$ anxiety had put all #thought# of #time# out of his #head# couch
$abbé_faria$ had now fully regained his consciousness but he still lay helpless and exhausted on his miserable #bed# i did not expect to see you again said he feebly to $m_dantès$
no i had no such #idea# but knowing that all was ready for flight i #thought# you might have made your escape
and why not asked the young #man# did you fancy yourself dying the deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of $m_dantès$
without you did you really think me capable of that at least said the #abbé# i now see how wrong such an #opinion# would have been
alas alas i am fearfully exhausted and debilitated by this attack be of good cheer replied $m_dantès$ your #strength# #will# #return#
and as he spoke he seated himself near the #bed# beside $abbé_faria$ and took his #hand# the #abbé# shook his #head#
the last attack i had said he lasted but #half# an #hour# and after it i was hungry and got up without help now i can move neither my #right# #arm# nor leg and my #head# seems uncomfortable which shows that there has been a suffusion of #blood# on the brain
the third attack #will# either carry me off or leave me paralyzed for #life# no no cried $m_dantès$
you are mistaken you #will# not die and your third attack if indeed you should have another #will# find you at #liberty#
we shall save you another #time# as we have done this only with a better #chance# of success because we shall be able to command every requisite assistance
my good $edmond_dantès$ answered the #abbé# be not deceived the attack which has just passed away condemns me forever to the #wall# of a #prison#
none can fly from a dungeon who cannot walk well we #will# wait a week a #month# two #month# if need be and meanwhile your #strength# #will# #return#
#everything# is in readiness for our flight and we can select any #time# we choose as soon as you feel able to swim we #will# go
i shall never swim again replied $abbé_faria$ this #arm# is paralyzed not for a #time# but forever lift it and judge if i am mistaken
the young #man# raised the #arm# which fell back by its own weight perfectly inanimate and helpless a sigh escaped him
you are convinced now $edmond_dantès$ are you not asked the #abbé# depend upon it i know what i say
indeed i expected it for it is a #family# inheritance both my #father# and #grandfather# died of it in a third attack
the physician who prepared for me the remedy i have twice successfully taken was no #other# than the celebrated cabanis and he predicted a similar #end# for me
since the first attack i experienced of this malady i have continually reflected on it the physician may be mistaken exclaimed $m_dantès$
and as for your poor #arm# what difference #will# that make i can take you on my #shoulder# and swim for both of us
my #son# said the #abbé# you who are a #sailor# and a swimmer must know as well as i do that a #man# so loaded would sink before he had done fifty strokes
cease then to allow yourself to be duped by vain #hope# that even your own excellent #heart# refuses to believe in
here i shall remain till the #hour# of my deliverance arrives and that in all human probability #will# be the #hour# of my #death#
as for you who are young and active delay not on my #account# but fly go i give you back your #promise#
it is well said $m_dantès$ then i shall also remain then rising and extending his #hand# with an #air# of solemnity over the old #man# #head# he slowly added
$abbé_faria$ gazed fondly on his noble minded single hearted high principled young #friend# and read in his #countenance# ample confirmation of the sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his #purpose#
by the #blood# of christ i swear never to leave you while you live #thank# murmured the invalid extending #one# #hand#
but as i cannot and you #will# not quit this #place# it becomes necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the #soldier#
gallery he might by #chance# hear the hollow #sound# of his footsteps and call the #attention# of his #officer# to the #circumstance#
i accept you may #one# of these #day# reap the reward of your disinterested devotion that would bring about a discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated
go then and set about this #work# in which unhappily i can offer you no assistance keep at it all #night# if necessary and do not #return# here #tomorrow# till after the #jailer# has visited me
i shall have #something# of the greatest importance to communicate to you $m_dantès$ took the #hand# of the #abbé# in his and affectionately pressed it
$abbé_faria$ smiled encouragingly on him and the young #man# retired to his task in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards his aged #friend#
#chapter# the #treasure# when $m_dantès$ returned next #morning# to the #chamber# of his #companion# in captivity he found $abbé_faria$ seated and looking composed
in the ray of #light# which entered by the narrow #window# of his cell he held open in his left #hand# of which alone it #will# be recollected he retained the #use# a sheet of #paper# which from being constantly rolled into a small compass had the form of a cylinder and was not easily kept open
he did not speak but showed the #paper# to $m_dantès$ what is that he inquired #look# at it said the #abbé# with a #smile#
and i only see a #half# burnt #paper# on which are traces of gothic characters inscribed with a peculiar kind of ink
i have looked at it with all possible #attention# said $m_dantès$ this #paper# my #friend# said $abbé_faria$
i may now avow to you since i have the #proof# of your fidelity this #paper# is my #treasure# of which from this #day# forth #one# #half# belongs to you
until this #day# and for how long a #time# he had refrained from talking of the #treasure# which had brought upon the #abbé# the accusation of madness
the sweat started forth on $m_dantès$ #brow# with his instinctive delicacy $edmond_dantès$ had preferred avoiding any touch on this painful chord and $abbé_faria$ had been equally silent
he had taken the #silence# of the old #man# for a #return# to #reason# and now these few #word# uttered by $abbé_faria$ after so painful a crisis seemed to indicate a serious relapse into mental alienation
your #treasure# stammered $m_dantès$ $abbé_faria$ smiled yes said he you have indeed a noble #nature# $edmond_dantès$ and i see by your paleness and agitation what is passing in your #heart# at this #moment#
no be assured i am not mad this #treasure# exists $m_dantès$ and if i have not been allowed to possess it you #will#
no #one# would listen or believe me because #everyone# #thought# me mad but you who must know that i am not listen to me and believe me so afterwards if you #will#
yes you alas murmured $edmond_dantès$ to himself this is a terrible relapse there was only this blow wanting
then he said aloud my dear #friend# your attack has perhaps fatigued you had you not better repose awhile
#tomorrow# if you #will# i #will# hear your narrative but #today# i #wish# to nurse you carefully besides he said a #treasure# is not a #thing# we need hurry about
on the #contrary# it is a #matter# of the utmost importance $edmond_dantès$ replied the old #man# who knows if #tomorrow# or the next #day# after the third attack may not come on
yes indeed i have often #thought# with a bitter #joy# that these riches which would make the wealth of a dozen #family# #will# be forever lost to those #man# who persecute me
this #idea# was #one# of vengeance to me and i tasted it slowly in the #night# of my dungeon and the #despair# of my captivity
but now i have forgiven the #world# for the #love# of you now that i see you young and with a promising future now that i think of all that may result to you in the good #fortune# of such a disclosure i shudder at any delay and tremble lest i should not assure to #one# as worthy as yourself the #possession# of so vast an amount of hidden wealth
and then must not all be over $edmond_dantès$ turned away his #head# with a sigh you persist in your incredulity $edmond_dantès$ continued $abbé_faria$
my #word# have not convinced you i see you require #proof# well then read this #paper# which i have never shown to #anyone#
#tomorrow# my dear #friend# said $edmond_dantès$ desirous of not yielding to the old #man# madness i #thought# it was understood that we should not talk of that until #tomorrow#
i #will# not irritate him #thought# $edmond_dantès$ and taking the #paper# of which #half# was wanting having been burnt no #doubt# by some accident he read
this #treasure# which may amount to two of roman crowns in the most distant a of the second #opening# wh declare to belong to him alo
then we #will# not talk of it until #tomorrow# but read this #paper# #today# heir
th april well said $abbé_faria$ when the young #man# had finished reading it why replied $m_dantès$ i see #nothing# but broken #line# and unconnected #word# which are rendered illegible by #fire#
yes to you my #friend# who read them for the first #time# but not for me who have grown pale over them by many #night# #study# and have reconstructed every phrase completed every #thought#
and do you believe you have discovered the hidden meaning i am sure i have and you shall judge for yourself but first listen to the history of this #paper#
and $m_dantès$ happy to escape the history and explanation which would be sure to confirm his belief in his #friend# mental instability glided like a snake along the narrow passage while $abbé_faria$ restored by his alarm to a certain amount of activity pushed the #stone# into #place# with his #foot# and covered it with a mat in #order# the more effectually to avoid discovery
#silence# exclaimed $m_dantès$ #step# approach i go adieu it was the #governor# who hearing of $abbé_faria$ illness from the #jailer# had come in #person# to see him
$abbé_faria$ sat up to receive him avoiding all gestures in #order# that he might conceal from the #governor# the paralysis that had already #half# stricken him with #death#
his #fear# was lest the #governor# touched with #pity# might #order# him to be removed to better #quarter# and thus separate him from his young #companion#
but fortunately this was not the #case# and the #governor# left him convinced that the poor madman for whom in his #heart# he felt a kind of affection was only troubled with a slight indisposition
$abbé_faria$ since their first acquaintance had been on all #point# so rational and logical so wonderfully sagacious in #fact# that he could not understand how so much wisdom on all #point# could be allied with madness
during this #time# $edmond_dantès$ seated on his #bed# with his #head# in his #hand# tried to collect his scattered #thought# was $abbé_faria$ deceived as to his #treasure# or was all the #world# deceived as to $abbé_faria$
$m_dantès$ remained in his cell all #day# not daring to #return# to his #friend# thinking thus to defer the #moment# when he should be convinced once for all that the #abbé# was mad such a conviction would be so terrible
but towards the #evening# after the #hour# for the customary #visit# had gone by $abbé_faria$ not seeing the young #man# appear tried to move and get over the #distance# which separated them
$edmond_dantès$ shuddered when he heard the painful #effort# which the old #man# made to drag himself along his leg was inert and he could no longer make #use# of #one# #arm#
$edmond_dantès$ was obliged to assist him for otherwise he would not have been able to enter by the small aperture which led to $m_dantès$ #chamber#
here i am pursuing you remorselessly he said with a benignant #smile# you #thought# to escape my munificence but it is in vain
$edmond_dantès$ saw there was no escape and placing the old #man# on his #bed# he seated himself on the stool beside him
you know said the #abbé# that i was the secretary and intimate #friend# of $cardinal_spada$ the last of the princes of that #name#
he was not rich although the wealth of his #family# had passed into a proverb and i heard the phrase very often
listen to me i owe to this worthy lord all the #happiness# i ever knew as rich as a $cardinal_spada$
i was tutor to his nephews who are dead and when he was alone in the #world# i tried by absolute devotion to his #will# to make up to him all he had done for me during ten #year# of unremitting kindness
but he like public rumor lived on this reputation for wealth his palace was my paradise the cardinal $house_of_peers$ had no #secret# for me
#one# #day# when i was reproaching him for his unavailing searches and deploring the prostration of #mind# that followed them he looked at me and smiling bitterly opened a volume relating to the history of the city of rome
there in the twentieth #chapter# of the #life# of pope alexander vi were the following #line# which i can never forget
the great wars of romagna had ended $cæsar_borgia$ who had completed his conquest had need of #money# to purchase all italy
i had often seen my noble patron annotating ancient volumes and eagerly searching amongst dusty #family# manuscripts the pope had also need of #money# to bring #matter# to an #end# with $louis_xviii$ xii
#king# of france who was formidable still in #spite# of his recent reverses and it was necessary therefore to have recourse to some profitable scheme which was a #matter# of great difficulty in the impoverished condition of exhausted italy
his holiness had an #idea# he determined to make two cardinals by choosing two of the greatest personages of rome especially rich #man#
in the first #place# he could sell the great appointments and splendid offices which the cardinals already held and then he had the two hats to sell besides
this was the #return# the holy #father# looked for there was a third #point# in view which #will# appear hereafter
the pope and $cæsar_borgia$ first found the two future cardinals they were giovanni rospigliosi who held four of the highest dignities of the holy see and $cæsar_borgia$ $cardinal_spada$ #one# of the noblest and richest of the roman nobility both felt the high #honor# of such a favor from the pope
the result was that rospigliosi and $cardinal_spada$ paid for being cardinals and eight #other# #person# paid for the offices the cardinals held before their elevation and thus eight hundred thousand crowns entered into the coffers of the speculators
they were ambitious and $cæsar_borgia$ soon found purchasers for their appointments it is #time# now to proceed to the last #part# of the speculation
the pope heaped #attention# upon rospigliosi and $cardinal_spada$ conferred upon them the insignia of the cardinalate and induced them to arrange their #affair# and take up their residence at rome
then the pope and $cæsar_borgia$ invited the two cardinals to #dinner# this was a #matter# of dispute between the holy #father# and his #son#
$cæsar_borgia$ #thought# they could make #use# of #one# of the #mean# which he always had ready for his #friend# that is to say in the first #place# the famous key which was given to certain #person# with the request that they go and open a designated cupboard
when this was pressed to #effect# the #opening# of the cupboard of which the lock was difficult the #person# was pricked by this small #point# and died next #day#
then there was the ring with the lion #head# which $cæsar_borgia$ wore when he wanted to greet his #friend# with a clasp of the #hand#
this key was furnished with a small #iron# #point# a negligence on the #part# of the locksmith the lion bit the #hand# thus favored and at the #end# of twenty four #hour# the bite was mortal
$cæsar_borgia$ proposed to his #father# that they should either ask the cardinals to open the cupboard or shake #hand# with them but alexander vi replied
now as to the worthy cardinals $cardinal_spada$ and rospigliosi let us ask both of them to #dinner# #something# tells me that we shall get that #money# back
besides you forget $cæsar_borgia$ an indigestion declares itself immediately while a prick or a bite occasions a delay of a #day# or two
the #table# was laid in a vineyard belonging to the pope near san pierdarena a charming retreat which the cardinals knew very well by report
$cæsar_borgia$ gave #way# before such cogent reasoning and the cardinals were consequently invited to #dinner# rospigliosi quite set up with his new dignities went with a good appetite and his most ingratiating #manner#
$cardinal_spada$ a prudent #man# and greatly attached to his only nephew a young #captain# of the highest #promise# took #paper# and pen and made his #will#
he then sent #word# to his nephew to wait for him near the vineyard but it appeared the #servant# did not find him
$cardinal_spada$ knew what these invitations meant since christianity so eminently civilizing had made progress in rome it was no longer a centurion who came from the tyrant with a message
but it was a legate latere who came with a #smile# on his #lip# to say from the pope
$cæsar_borgia$ #will# that you die his holiness requests you to dine with him $cardinal_spada$ set out about two clock to san pierdarena
the first #sight# that attracted the #eye# of $cardinal_spada$ was that of his nephew in full #costume# and $cæsar_borgia$ paying him most marked #attention#
$cardinal_spada$ turned pale as $cæsar_borgia$ looked at him with an ironical #air# which proved that he had anticipated all and that the snare was well spread
the pope awaited him they began #dinner# and $cardinal_spada$ was only able to inquire of his nephew if he had received his message
it was too late for he had already drunk a #glass# of excellent wine placed for him expressly by the pope
the nephew replied no perfectly comprehending the meaning of the #question# butler $cardinal_spada$ at the same #moment# saw another bottle approach him which he was pressed to taste
$cardinal_spada$ died on the threshold of the vineyard the nephew expired at his own #door# making #sign# which his #wife# could not comprehend
then $cæsar_borgia$ and the pope hastened to lay #hand# on the heritage under pretense of seeking for the #paper# of the dead #man#
but the inheritance consisted in this only a scrap of #paper# on which $cardinal_spada$ had written i bequeath to my beloved nephew my coffers my books and amongst #other# my breviary with the #gold# #corner# which i beg he #will# preserve in remembrance of his affectionate uncle
the heirs sought everywhere admired the breviary laid #hand# on the furniture and were greatly astonished that $cardinal_spada$ the rich #man# was really the most miserable of uncles
an #hour# afterwards a physician declared they were both poisoned through eating mushrooms no #treasure# unless they were those of science contained in the library and laboratories
$cæsar_borgia$ and his #father# searched examined scrutinized but found #nothing# or at least very little not exceeding a few thousand crowns in plate and about the same in ready #money# but the nephew had #time# to say to his #wife# before he expired
that was all #look# well among my uncle #paper# there is a #will# they sought even more thoroughly than the august heirs had done but it was fruitless
there were two palaces and a vineyard behind the palatine hill but in these #day# landed property had not much value and the two palaces and the vineyard remained to the #family# since they were beneath the rapacity of the pope and his #son#
$cæsar_borgia$ poisoned at the same #time# escaped by shedding his skin like a snake but the new skin was spotted by the #poison# till it looked like a tiger
#month# and #year# rolled on alexander vi died poisoned you know by what mistake then compelled to quit rome he went and got himself obscurely killed in a #night# skirmish scarcely noticed in history
after the pope #death# and his #son# exile it was supposed that the $cardinal_spada$ #family# would resume the splendid #position# they had held before the cardinal #time# but this was not the #case#
the spadas remained in doubtful ease a mystery hung over this dark #affair# and the public rumor was that $cæsar_borgia$ a better politician than his #father# had carried off from the pope the #fortune# of the two cardinals
i say the two because cardinal rospigliosi who had not taken any precaution was completely despoiled up to this #point# said $abbé_faria$ interrupting the thread of his narrative
this seems to you very meaningless no #doubt# eh oh my #friend# cried $m_dantès$ on the #contrary# it seems as if i were reading a most interesting narrative go on i beg of you
#year# rolled on and amongst the descendants some were #soldier# #other# diplomatists some churchmen some #banker# some grew rich and some were ruined
i #will# the #family# began to get accustomed to their obscurity i come now to the last of the #family#
i had often heard him complain of the disproportion of his rank with his #fortune# and i advised him to invest all he had in an annuity
whose secretary i was the #count# of $cardinal_spada$ he did so and thus doubled his income the celebrated breviary remained in the #family# and was in the #count# #possession#
it had been handed down from #father# to #son# for the singular clause of the only #will# that had been found had caused it to be regarded as a genuine relic preserved in the #family# with superstitious veneration
it was an illuminated book with beautiful gothic characters and so weighty with #gold# that a #servant# always carried it before the cardinal on #day# of great solemnity
at the #sight# of #paper# of all #sort# titles contracts parchments which were kept in the archives of the #family# all descending from the poisoned cardinal i in my #turn# examined the immense bundles of documents like twenty servitors stewards secretaries before me but in #spite# of the most exhaustive researches i found #nothing#
yet i had read i had even written a precise history of the $cæsar_borgia$ #family# for the sole #purpose# of assuring myself whether any increase of #fortune# had occurred to them on the #death# of the cardinal $cæsar_borgia$ $cardinal_spada$ but could only trace the acquisition of the property of the cardinal rospigliosi his #companion# in #misfortune#
i was then almost assured that the inheritance had neither profited the borgias nor the #family# but had remained unpossessed like the #treasure# of the arabian #night# which slept in the bosom of the #earth# under the #eye# of the genie
i searched ransacked counted calculated a thousand and a thousand #time# the income and expenditure of the #family# for three hundred #year#
it was useless i remained in my ignorance and the #count# of $cardinal_spada$ in his poverty my patron died
all these he bequeathed to me with a thousand roman crowns which he had in ready #money# on condition that i would have anniversary masses said for the repose of his soul and that i would draw up a genealogical #tree# and history of his $house_of_peers$
he had reserved from his annuity his #family# #paper# his library composed of five thousand volumes and his famous breviary all this i did scrupulously
in a #month# before i was arrested and a fortnight after the #death# of the #count# of $cardinal_spada$ on the th of december you #will# see presently how the date became fixed in my memory i was reading for the thousandth #time# the #paper# i was arranging for the palace was sold to a #stranger# and i was going to leave rome and settle at florence intending to take with me twelve thousand #franc# i possessed my library and the famous breviary when tired with my constant labor at the same #thing# and overcome by a heavy #dinner# i had eaten my #head# dropped on my #hand# and i fell asleep about three clock in the afternoon
be easy my dear $edmond_dantès$ we are near the conclusion i awoke as the clock was striking six
i raised my #head# i was in utter #darkness# i rang for a #light# but as no #one# came i determined to find #one# for myself
i took a wax candle in #one# #hand# and with the #other# groped about for a #piece# of #paper# my match #box# being empty with which i proposed to get a #light# from the small flame still playing on the embers
fearing however to make #use# of any valuable #piece# of #paper# i hesitated for a #moment# then recollected that i had seen in the famous breviary which was on the #table# beside me an old #paper# quite yellow with #age# and which had served as a marker for centuries kept there by the request of the heirs
i felt for it found it twisted it up together and putting it into the expiring flame set #light# to it
but beneath my #finger# as if by magic in proportion as the #fire# ascended i saw yellowish characters appear on the #paper#
i grasped it in my #hand# put out the flame as quickly as i could lighted my taper in the #fire# itself and opened the crumpled #paper# with inexpressible #emotion# recognizing when i had done so that these characters had been traced in mysterious and sympathetic ink only appearing when exposed to the #fire# nearly #one# third of the #paper# had been consumed by the flame
it was that #paper# you read this #morning# read it again $m_dantès$ and then i #will# complete for you the incomplete #word# and unconnected sense
$abbé_faria$ with an #air# of triumph offered the #paper# to $m_dantès$ who this #time# read the following #word# traced with an ink of a reddish color resembling rust
it was indeed but anticipating the simple #manner# which i should soon be under the necessity of adopting
he may #desire# to become my heir and re and bentivoglio who were poisoned my sole heir that i have bu and has visited with me that is in
this th #day# of april be alexander vi and fearing that not #island# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ all i poss jewels #diamond# gems
that i alone may amount to nearly two mil #will# find on raising the twentieth ro creek to the east in a #right# #line#
two open in these caves the #treasure# is in the furthest a which #treasure# i bequeath and leave en as my sole heir
and now said the #abbé# read this #other# #paper# and he presented to $m_dantès$ a second leaf with fragments of #line# written on it which $edmond_dantès$ read as follows
th april cæs ing invited to dine by his holiness content with making me pay for my hat serves for me the fate of cardinals caprara
the caves of the small essed of ingots #gold# #money# know of the existence of this #treasure# which lions of roman crowns and which
i declare to my nephew guido $cardinal_spada$ ried in a #place# he knows he ck from the small ings have been made ngle in the second tire to him
and now he said when he saw that $m_dantès$ had read the last #line# put the two fragments together and judge for yourself
ar $cardinal_spada$ $abbé_faria$ followed him with an excited #look# $m_dantès$ obeyed and the conjointed #piece# gave the following m

well do you comprehend now inquired $abbé_faria$ it is the declaration of $cardinal_spada$ and the #will# so long sought for replied $edmond_dantès$ still incredulous
aided by the remaining fragment i guessed the #rest# measuring the #length# of the #line# by those of the #paper# and divining the hidden meaning by #mean# of what was in #part# revealed as we are guided in a cavern by the small ray of #light# above us
yes a thousand #time# yes and who completed it as it now is i did
i resolved to set out and did set out at that very #instant# carrying with me the beginning of my great #work# the unity of the italian kingdom but for some #time# the imperial #police# who at this period quite #contrary# to what $napoleon$ desired so soon as he had a #son# born to him wished for a partition of provinces had their #eye# on me and my hasty departure the cause of which they were unable to guess having aroused their suspicions i was arrested at the very #moment#
now continued $abbé_faria$ addressing $m_dantès$ with an almost paternal #expression# now my dear #fellow# you know as much as i do myself
if we ever escape together #half# this #treasure# is yours if i die here and you escape alone the whole belongs to you
and what did you do when you arrived at this conclusion i was leaving piombino but inquired $m_dantès$ hesitating has this #treasure# no more legitimate possessor in the #world# than ourselves
the last #count# of $cardinal_spada$ moreover made me his heir bequeathing to me this symbolic breviary he bequeathed to me all it contained no no make your #mind# satisfied on that #point#
no no be easy on that score the #family# is extinct if we lay #hand# on this #fortune# we may enjoy it without remorse
and you say this #treasure# amounts to two #million# of roman crowns nearly thirteen #million# of our #money# impossible said $m_dantès$ staggered at the enormous amount
the $cardinal_spada$ #family# was #one# of the oldest and most powerful #family# of the fifteenth century and in those #time# when #other# opportunities for investment were wanting such accumulations of #gold# and jewels were by no #mean# rare there are at this #day# roman #family# perishing of hunger though possessed of nearly a #million# in #diamond# and jewels handed down by entail and which they cannot touch
impossible and why asked the old #man# $edmond_dantès$ #thought# he was in a #dream# he wavered between incredulity and #joy#
i have only kept this #secret# so long from you continued $abbé_faria$ that i might test your character and then surprise you
had we escaped before my attack of catalepsy i should have conducted you to $m_de_monte_cristo$ now he added with a sigh it is you who #will# conduct me thither
well $m_dantès$ you do not #thank# me this #treasure# belongs to you my dear #friend# replied $m_dantès$ and to you only
i have no #right# to it i am no relation of yours you are my #son# $m_dantès$ exclaimed the old #man#
god has sent you to me to console at #one# and the same #time# the #man# who could not be a #father# and the #prisoner# who could not get free
and $abbé_faria$ extended the #arm# of which alone the #use# remained to him to the young #man# who threw himself upon his neck and wept
the third attack now that this #treasure# which had so long been the object of the #abbé# meditations could insure the future #happiness# of him whom $abbé_faria$ really loved as a #son# it had doubled its value in his #eye# and every #day# he expatiated on the amount explaining to $m_dantès$ all the good which with thirteen or fourteen #million# of #franc# a #man# could do in these #day# to his #friend# and then $m_dantès$ #countenance# became gloomy for the oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory and he reflected how much ill in these #time# a #man# with thirteen or fourteen #million# could do to his #enemy#
the #abbé# did not know the #island# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ but $m_dantès$ knew it and had often passed it situated twenty five miles from pianosa between corsica and the #island# of $elba$ and had once touched there
you are the #child# of my captivity my profession condemns me to celibacy #chapter# this #island# was always had been and still is completely deserted
it is a #rock# of almost conical form which #look# as though it had been thrust up by volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean
$m_dantès$ drew a #plan# of the #island# for $abbé_faria$ and $abbé_faria$ gave $m_dantès$ advice as to the #mean# he should employ to recover the #treasure#
it was past a #question# now that $abbé_faria$ was not a lunatic and the #way# in which he had achieved the discovery which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness increased $edmond_dantès$ admiration of him but at the same #time# $m_dantès$ could not believe that the deposit supposing it had ever existed still existed and though he considered the #treasure# as by no #mean# chimerical he yet believed it was no longer there
however as if fate resolved on depriving the #prisoner# of their last #chance# and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual imprisonment a new #misfortune# befell them the gallery on the #sea# #side# which had long been in ruins was rebuilt
but $m_dantès$ was far from being as enthusiastic and confident as the old #man# they had repaired it completely and stopped up with vast masses of #stone# the hole $m_dantès$ had partly filled in
but for this precaution which it #will# be remembered the #abbé# had made to $edmond_dantès$ the #misfortune# would have been still greater for their attempt to escape would have been detected and they would undoubtedly have been separated
you see said the young #man# with an #air# of sorrowful resignation to $abbé_faria$ that god deems it #right# to take from me any claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you
thus a new a stronger and more inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their #hope# i have promised to remain forever with you and now i could not break my #promise# if i would
the #treasure# #will# be no more mine than yours and neither of us #will# quit this #prison# but my real #treasure# is not that
my dear #friend# which awaits me beneath the sombre #rock# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ it is your #presence# our living together five or six #hour# a #day# in #spite# of our #jailer# it is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain the languages you have implanted in my memory and which have taken root there with all their philological ramifications
these different sciences that you have made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them and the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced them
believe me and take comfort this is better for me than tons of #gold# and #case# of #diamond# even were they not as problematical as the clouds we see in the #morning# floating over the #sea# which we take for terra firma and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them
to have you as long as possible near me to hear your eloquent speech which embellishes my #mind# strengthens my soul and makes my whole frame capable of great and terrible #thing# if i should ever be free so fills my whole existence that the #despair# to which i was just on the #point# of yielding when i knew you has no longer any hold over me and this
this is my #treasure# my beloved #friend# and with this you have made me rich and happy this is my #fortune# not chimerical but actual
i owe you my real good my present #happiness# and all the sovereigns of the #earth# even $cæsar_borgia$ himself could not deprive me of this
thus if not actually happy yet the #day# these two unfortunates passed together went quickly $abbé_faria$ who for so long a #time# had kept #silence# as to the #treasure# now perpetually talked of it
as he had prophesied would be the #case# he remained paralyzed in the #right# #arm# and the left leg and had given up all #hope# of ever enjoying it himself
but he was continually thinking over some #mean# of escape for his young #companion# and anticipating the #pleasure# he would enjoy
for #fear# the #letter# might be some #day# lost or stolen he compelled $m_dantès$ to learn it by #heart# and $m_dantès$ knew it from the first to the last #word#
then he destroyed the second portion assured that if the first were seized no #one# would be able to discover its real meaning
whole #hour# sometimes passed while $abbé_faria$ was giving instructions to $m_dantès$ instructions which were to serve him when he was at #liberty#
#one# only #thought# which was to gain $m_de_monte_cristo$ by some #mean# and remain there alone under some pretext which would arouse no suspicions and once there to endeavor to find the wonderful caverns and search in the appointed #spot# the appointed #spot# be it remembered being the farthest angle in the second #opening#
then once free from the #day# and #hour# and #moment# when he was so he could have but in the meanwhile the #hour# passed if not rapidly at least tolerably
$abbé_faria$ as we have said without having recovered the #use# of his #hand# and #foot# had regained all the clearness of his understanding and had gradually besides the moral instructions we have detailed taught his youthful #companion# the patient and sublime #duty# of a #prisoner# who learns to make #something# from #nothing#
$m_dantès$ for #fear# of recalling the almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant #light# wandering in the #night#
so #life# went on for them as it does for those who are not victims of #misfortune# and whose activities glide along mechanically and tranquilly beneath the #eye# of providence
but beneath this superficial calm there were in the #heart# of the young #man# and perhaps in that of the old #man# many repressed #desire# many stifled sighs which found vent when $abbé_faria$ was left alone and when $edmond_dantès$ returned to his cell
they were thus perpetually employed $abbé_faria$ that he might not see himself grow old #one# #night# $edmond_dantès$ awoke suddenly believing that he heard someone calling him
he opened his #eye# upon utter #darkness# his #name# or rather a plaintive #voice# which essayed to pronounce his #name# reached him
he sat up in #bed# and a cold sweat broke out upon his #brow# undoubtedly the call came from $abbé_faria$ dungeon
he moved his #bed# drew up the #stone# rushed into the passage and reached the opposite extremity the #secret# entrance was open
by the #light# of the wretched and wavering lamp of which we have spoken $m_dantès$ saw the old #man# pale but yet erect clinging to the bedstead
his #feature# were writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew and which had so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first #time#
alas murmured $edmond_dantès$ can it be alas my dear #friend# said $abbé_faria$ in a resigned #tone# you understand do you not and i need not attempt to explain to you
$edmond_dantès$ uttered a #cry# of agony and quite out of his senses rushed towards the #door# exclaiming help help
we must now only think of you my dear #friend# and so act as to render your captivity supportable or your flight possible
it would require #year# to do again what i have done here and the results would be instantly destroyed if our #jailer# knew we had communicated with each #other#
besides be assured my dear $edmond_dantès$ the dungeon i am about to leave #will# not long remain empty some #other# unfortunate being #will# soon take my #place# and to him you #will# appear like an angel of salvation
perhaps he #will# be young strong and enduring like yourself and #will# aid you in your escape while i have been but a hindrance
$abbé_faria$ had just sufficient #strength# to restrain him #silence# he said or you are lost you #will# no longer have #half# a dead #body# tied to you as a drag to all your movements
at #length# providence has done #something# for you he restores to you more than he takes away and it was #time# i should die
oh my #friend# my #friend# speak not thus and then resuming all his #presence# of #mind# which had for a #moment# staggered under this blow and his #strength# which had failed at the #word# of the old #man# he said
oh i have saved you once and i #will# save you a second #time# and raising the #foot# of the #bed# he drew out the phial still a third filled with the red liquor
$edmond_dantès$ could only clasp his #hand# and exclaim see he exclaimed there remains still some of the magic draught
quick quick tell me what i must do this #time# are there any fresh instructions speak my #friend# i listen
there is not a #hope# replied $abbé_faria$ shaking his #head# but no #matter# god #will# it that #man# whom he has created and in whose #heart# he has so profoundly rooted the #love# of #life# should do all in his #power# to preserve that existence which however painful it may be is yet always so dear
oh yes yes exclaimed $m_dantès$ and i tell you that i #will# save you yet
these horrible chills which make my teeth chatter and seem to dislocate my bones begin to pervade my whole frame in five #minute# the malady #will# reach its height and in a #quarter# of an #hour# there #will# be #nothing# left of me but a corpse
well then try the cold gains upon me i feel the #blood# flowing towards my brain oh exclaimed $m_dantès$ his #heart# wrung with anguish
do as you did before only do not wait so long all the springs of #life# are now exhausted in me and #death# he continued looking at his paralyzed #arm# and leg
if after having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten you see that i do not recover then pour the #rest# down my throat
has but #half# its #work# to do now lift me on my #bed# for i can no longer support myself
and now my dear #friend# said $abbé_faria$ sole consolation of my wretched existence you whom heaven gave me somewhat late but still gave me a priceless gift and for which i am most grateful at
the #moment# of separating from you forever i #wish# you all the #happiness# and all the prosperity you so well deserve
$edmond_dantès$ took the old #man# in his #arm# and laid him on the #bed# my #son# i bless thee
the young #man# cast himself on his knees leaning his #head# against the old #man# #bed# listen now to what i say in this my dying #moment#
the #treasure# of the spadas exists god grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by #time# or space i see it in the depths of the inner cavern
my #eye# pierce the inmost recesses of the #earth# and are dazzled at the #sight# of so much riches if you do escape remember that the poor #abbé# whom all the #world# called mad was not so
hasten to $m_de_monte_cristo$ avail yourself of the #fortune# for you have indeed suffered long enough a violent convulsion attacked the old #man#
$m_dantès$ raised his #head# and saw $abbé_faria$ #eye# injected with #blood# it seemed as if a flow of #blood# had ascended from the chest to the #head#
adieu adieu murmured the old #man# clasping $edmond_dantès$ #hand# convulsively adieu oh no no not yet he cried do not forsake me
oh succor him help help help hush hush murmured the dying #man# that they may not separate us if you save me
you are #right# oh yes yes be assured i shall save you besides although you suffer much you do not seem to be in such agony as you were before
at your #age# we have faith in #life# it is the privilege of youth to believe and #hope# but old #man# see #death# more clearly
do not mistake i suffer less because there is in me less #strength# to endure oh tis here tis here tis over
and raising himself by a final #effort# in which he summoned all his faculties he said $m_de_monte_cristo$ forget not $m_de_monte_cristo$
the crisis was terrible and a rigid form with twisted limbs swollen eyelids and #lip# flecked with bloody foam lay on the #bed# of torture in #place# of the intellectual being who so lately rested there
$m_dantès$ took the lamp placed it on a projecting #stone# above the #bed# whence its tremulous #light# fell with strange and fantastic ray on the distorted #countenance# and motionless stiffened #body#
my #sight# is gone my senses fail your #hand# $m_dantès$ adieu adieu and he fell back on the #bed# with steady gaze he awaited confidently the #moment# for administering the restorative
when he believed that the #right# #moment# had arrived he took the knife pried open the teeth which offered less resistance than before counted #one# after the #other# twelve drops and watched the phial contained perhaps twice as much more
he waited ten #minute# a #quarter# of an #hour# #half# an #hour# no change took #place# trembling his #hair# erect his #brow# bathed with perspiration he counted the seconds by the beating of his #heart#
then he #thought# it was #time# to make the last trial and he put the phial to the purple #lip# of $abbé_faria$ and without having occasion to force open his jaws which had remained extended he poured the whole of the liquid down his throat
the draught produced a galvanic #effect# a violent trembling pervaded the old #man# limbs his #eye# opened until it was fearful to gaze upon them he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek and then his convulsed #body# returned gradually to its former immobility the #eye# remaining open
#half# an #hour# an #hour# an #hour# and a #half# elapsed and during this period of anguish $edmond_dantès$ leaned over his #friend# his #hand# applied to his #heart# and felt the #body# gradually grow cold and the #heart#
pulsation become more and more deep and dull until at #length# it stopped the last movement of the #heart# ceased the #face# became livid the #eye# remained open but the eyeballs were glazed
it was six clock in the #morning# the dawn was just breaking and its feeble ray came into the dungeon and paled the ineffectual #light# of the lamp
while the struggle between #day# and #night# lasted $m_dantès$ still doubted but as soon as the daylight gained the pre eminence he saw that he was alone with a corpse
then an invincible and extreme #terror# seized upon him and he dared not again press the #hand# that hung out of #bed# he dared no longer to gaze on those fixed and vacant #eye# which he tried many #time# to close but in vain they opened again as soon as shut
he extinguished the lamp carefully concealed it and then went away closing as well as he could the entrance to the #secret# passage by the large #stone# as he descended
strange #shadow# passed over the #countenance# of the dead #man# and at #time# gave it the #appearance# of #life# it was #time# for the #jailer# was coming
on this occasion he began his rounds at $m_dantès$ cell and on leaving him he went on to $abbé_faria$ dungeon taking thither breakfast and some linen
$m_dantès$ was then seized with an indescribable #desire# to know what was going on in the dungeon of his unfortunate #friend#
he therefore returned by the subterraneous gallery and arrived in #time# to hear the exclamations of the turnkey who called out for help
#nothing# betokened that the #man# knew #anything# of what had occurred he went on his #way# #other# turnkeys came and then was heard the regular tramp of #soldier#
$edmond_dantès$ heard the creaking of the #bed# as they moved the corpse heard the #voice# of the #governor# who asked them to throw #water# on the dead #man# #face# and seeing that in #spite# of this application the #prisoner# did not recover they sent for the #doctor#
last of all came the #governor# the #governor# then went out and #word# of #pity# fell on $m_dantès$ listening ears mingled with brutal laughter
well well said #one# the madman has gone to #look# after his #treasure# good journey to him
with all his #million# he #will# not have enough to pay for his shroud said another oh added a third #voice# the shrouds of the château if are not dear
perhaps said #one# of the previous speakers as he was a churchman they may go to some expense in his behalf
they may give him the #honor# of the sack $edmond_dantès$ did not lose a #word# but comprehended very little of what was said
the #voice# soon ceased and it seemed to him as if #everyone# had left the cell still he dared not to enter as they might have left some turnkey to watch the dead
he remained therefore mute and motionless hardly venturing to breathe at the #end# of an #hour# he heard a faint #noise# which increased
it was the #governor# who returned followed by the #doctor# and #other# attendants there was a #moment# #silence# it was evident that the #doctor# was examining the dead #body#
the inquiries soon commenced the #doctor# analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the #prisoner# had succumbed and declared that he was dead
#question# and #answer# followed in a nonchalant #manner# that made $m_dantès$ indignant for he felt that all the #world# should have for the poor #abbé# a #love# and respect equal to his own
i am very sorry for what you tell me said the #governor# replying to the assurance of the #doctor# that the old #man# is really dead for he was a quiet inoffensive #prisoner# happy in his folly and required no watching
there was no occasion for watching him he would have stayed here fifty #year# i ll #answer# for it without any attempt to escape
i believe it #will# be requisite notwithstanding your certainty and not that i #doubt# your science but in discharge of my official #duty# that we should be perfectly assured that the #prisoner# is dead
there was a #moment# of complete #silence# during which $m_dantès$ still listening knew that the #doctor# was examining the corpse a second #time#
ah added the turnkey still said the #governor# you may make your #mind# easy said the #doctor# he is dead
you know #sir# said the #governor# persisting that we are not content in such #case# as this with such a simple examination
in #spite# of all #appearance# be so kind therefore as to finish your #duty# by fulfilling the formalities described by #law#
i #will# #answer# for that let the #iron# be heated said the #doctor# but really it is a useless precaution
he heard hasty #step# the creaking of a #door# #people# going and coming and some #minute# afterwards a turnkey entered saying here is the brazier lighted
there was a #moment# #silence# and then was heard the crackling of burning flesh of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the #wall# where $m_dantès$ was listening in horror
this #order# to heat the #iron# made $m_dantès$ shudder the perspiration poured forth upon the young #man# #brow# and he felt as if he should faint
you see #sir# he is really dead said the #doctor# this burn in the heel is decisive the poor fool is cured of his folly and delivered from his captivity
wasnt his #name# $abbé_faria$ inquired #one# of the #officer# who accompanied the #governor# yes #sir# and as he said it was an ancient #name#
he was too very learned and rational enough on all #point# which did not relate to his #treasure# but on that indeed he was intractable
it is the #sort# of malady which we call monomania said the #doctor# you had never #anything# to complain of said the #governor# to the #jailer# who had charge of the #abbé#
never #sir# replied the #jailer# never on the #contrary# he sometimes amused me very much by telling me #story# #one# #day# too when my #wife# was ill he gave me a prescription which cured her
i did not know that i had a rival but i #hope# #governor# that you #will# show him all proper respect in consequence
ah ah said the #doctor# yes yes make your #mind# easy he shall be decently interred in the newest sack we can find
#will# that satisfy you must this last formality take #place# in your #presence# #sir# inquired a turnkey certainly but make haste
#other# footsteps going and coming were now heard and a #moment# afterwards the #noise# of rustling canvas reached $m_dantès$ ears the #bed# creaked and the heavy footfall of a #man# who lifts a weight sounded on the #floor# then the #bed# again creaked under the weight deposited upon it
i cannot stay here all #day# this #evening# said the #governor# #will# there be any mass asked #one# of the attendants
the chaplain of the château came to me #yesterday# to beg for leave of absence in #order# to take a trip to hyères for a week
that is impossible replied the #governor# i told him i would attend to the #prisoner# in his absence if the poor #abbé# had not been in such a hurry he might have had his requiem
pooh pooh said the #doctor# with the impiety usual in #person# of his profession he is a churchman god #will# respect his profession and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a #priest#
a shout of laughter followed this brutal jest meanwhile the operation of putting the #body# in the sack was going on
this #evening# said the #governor# when the task was ended at what #hour# inquired a turnkey why about ten or eleven clock
shall we watch by the corpse of what #use# would it be shut the dungeon as if he were alive that is all
then the #step# retreated and the #voice# died away in the #distance# the #noise# of the #door# with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased and a #silence# more sombre than that of solitude ensued the #silence# of #death# which was all pervasive and struck its icy chill to the very soul of $m_dantès$
then he raised the flag #stone# cautiously with his #head# and looked carefully around the #chamber# it was empty and $m_dantès$ emerged from the tunnel
on the #bed# at full #length# and faintly illuminated by the pale #light# that came from the #window# lay a sack of canvas and under its rude folds was stretched a long and stiffened form it was $abbé_faria$ s
#chapter# the cemetery of the château if last winding sheet a winding sheet which as the turnkey said cost so little #everything# was in readiness
no longer could $edmond_dantès$ #look# into those wide open #eye# which had seemed to be penetrating the mysteries of #death# no longer could he clasp the #hand# which had done so much to make his existence blessed
a barrier had been placed between $m_dantès$ and his old #friend# $abbé_faria$ the beneficent and cheerful #companion# with whom he was accustomed to live so intimately no longer breathed
he seated himself on the edge of that terrible #bed# and fell into melancholy and gloomy reverie alone he was alone again
alone never again to see the #face# never again to hear the #voice# of the only human being who united him to #earth#
was not $abbé_faria$ fate the better after all to solve the problem of #life# at its source even at the risk of horrible suffering
the #idea# of suicide which his #friend# had driven away and kept away by his cheerful #presence# now hovered like a phantom over the #abbé# dead #body#
again condemned to #silence# again #face# to #face# with nothingness if i could die he said i should go where he goes and should assuredly find him again
i #will# remain here rush on the first #person# that opens the #door# strangle him and then they #will# guillotine me
but excessive #grief# is like a storm at #sea# where the frail bark is tossed from the depths to the top of the wave
$m_dantès$ recoiled from the #idea# of so infamous a #death# and passed suddenly from #despair# to an ardent #desire# for #life# and #liberty#
but how to die it is very easy he went on with a #smile# die oh no he exclaimed not die now after having lived and suffered so long and so much
yes had i died #year# ago but now to die would be indeed to give #way# to the sarcasm of destiny
no i want to live i shall struggle to the very last i #will# yet win back the #happiness# of which i have been deprived
before i die i must not forget that i have my executioners to punish and perhaps too who knows some #friend# to reward
as he said this he became silent and gazed straight before him like #one# overwhelmed with a strange and amazing #thought#
suddenly he arose lifted his #hand# to his #brow# as if his brain were giddy paced twice or thrice round the dungeon and then paused abruptly by the #bed#
die yet they #will# forget me here and i shall die in my dungeon like $abbé_faria$ just god he muttered whence comes this #thought#
is it from thee since none but the dead pass freely from this dungeon let me take the #place# of the dead
without giving himself #time# to reconsider his decision and indeed that he might not allow his #thought# to be distracted from his desperate resolution he bent over the appalling shroud opened it with the knife which $abbé_faria$ had made drew the corpse from the sack and bore it along the tunnel to his own #chamber# laid it on his couch tied around its #head# the rag he wore at #night# around his own covered it with his counterpane once again kissed the ice cold #brow# and tried vainly to close the resisting #eye# which glared horribly turned the #head# towards the #wall# so that the #jailer# might when he brought the #evening# meal believe that he was asleep as was his frequent custom entered the tunnel again drew the #bed# against the #wall# returned to the #other# cell took from the hiding #place# the needle and thread flung off his rags that they might feel only naked flesh beneath the coarse canvas and getting inside the sack placed himself in the posture in which the dead #body# had been laid and sewed up the mouth of the sack from the inside
he would have been discovered by the beating of his #heart# if by any mischance the #jailer# had entered at that #moment#
$m_dantès$ might have waited until the #evening# #visit# was over but he was afraid that the #governor# would change his #mind# and #order# the dead #body# to be removed earlier
in that #case# his last #hope# would have been destroyed now his #plan# were fully made and this is what he intended to do
if while he was being carried out the grave diggers should discover that they were bearing a live instead of a dead #body# $m_dantès$ did not intend to give them #time# to recognize him but with a sudden cut of the knife he meant to open the sack from top to bottom and profiting by their alarm escape if they tried to catch him he would #use# his knife to better #purpose#
if they took him to the cemetery and laid him in a grave he would allow himself to be covered with #earth# and then as it was #night# the grave diggers could scarcely have turned their backs before he would have worked his #way# through the yielding soil and escaped
if he was detected in this and the #earth# proved too heavy he would be stifled and then so much the better all would be over
$m_dantès$ had not eaten since the preceding #evening# but he had not #thought# of hunger nor did he think of it now
he hoped that the weight of #earth# would not be so great that he could not overcome it his situation was too precarious to allow him even #time# to reflect on any #thought# but #one#
the first risk that $m_dantès$ ran was that the #jailer# when he brought him his supper at seven clock might perceive the change that had been made fortunately twenty #time# at least from misanthropy or fatigue $m_dantès$ had received his #jailer# in #bed# and then the #man# placed his bread and soup on the #table# and went away without saying a #word#
this #time# the #jailer# might not be as silent as usual but speak to $m_dantès$ and seeing that he received no reply go to the #bed# and thus discover all
his #hand# placed upon his #heart# was unable to redress its throbbings while with the #other# he wiped the perspiration from his temples
when seven clock came $m_dantès$ agony really began from #time# to #time# chills ran through his whole #body# and clutched his #heart# in a grasp of ice
then he #thought# he was going to die yet the #hour# passed on without any unusual disturbance and $m_dantès$ knew that he had escaped the first peril
$edmond_dantès$ felt that the #moment# had arrived summoned up all his courage held his breath and would have been happy if at the same #time# he could have repressed the throbbing of his veins
it was a good augury at #length# about the #hour# the #governor# had appointed footsteps were heard on the stairs the footsteps they were double paused at the #door#
and $m_dantès$ guessed that the two grave diggers had come to seek him this #idea# was soon converted into certainty when he heard the #noise# they made in putting down the #hand# bier
the #door# opened and a dim #light# reached $m_dantès$ #eye# through the coarse sack that covered him he saw two #shadow# approach his #bed# a third remaining at the #door# with a torch in its #hand#
the two #man# approaching the #end# of the #bed# took the sack by its extremities he heavy though for an old and thin #man# said #one# as he raised the #head#
they say every #year# adds #half# a pound to the weight of the bones said another lifting the #foot#
have you tied the knot inquired the first speaker what would be the #use# of carrying so much more weight
was the reply i can do that when we get there yes you re #right# replied the #companion#
$edmond_dantès$ stiffened himself in #order# to play the #part# of a dead #man# and then the party lighted by the #man# with the torch who went first ascended the stairs
what the knot for #thought# $m_dantès$ they deposited the supposed corpse on the bier suddenly he felt the fresh and sharp #night# #air# and $m_dantès$ knew that the mistral was blowing
it was a sensation in which #pleasure# and pain were strangely mingled the bearers went on for twenty paces then stopped putting the bier down on the #ground#
#one# of them went away and $m_dantès$ heard his shoes striking on the pavement where am i he asked himself
really he is by no #mean# a #light# load said the #other# bearer sitting on the edge of the #hand# barrow
$m_dantès$ first impulse was to escape but fortunately he did not attempt it give us a #light# said the #other# bearer
or i shall never find what i am looking for the #man# with the torch complied although not asked in the most polite terms
what can he be looking for #thought# $edmond_dantès$ the spade perhaps an exclamation of satisfaction indicated that the grave digger had found the object of his search
here it is at last he said not without some trouble though yes was the #answer# but it has lost #nothing# by waiting
as he said this the #man# came towards $edmond_dantès$ who heard a heavy metallic substance laid down beside him and at the same #moment# a cord was fastened round his #foot# with sudden and painful violence
well have you tied the knot inquired the grave digger who was looking on yes and pretty tight too
i can tell you was the #answer# move on then and the bier was lifted once more and they proceeded
the #noise# of the waves dashing against the #rock# on which the château is built reached $m_dantès$ ear distinctly as they went forward
they advanced fifty paces farther and then stopped to open a #door# then went forward again bad weather observed #one# of the bearers
why yes the #abbé# runs a #chance# of being wet said the #other# and then there was a burst of brutal laughter
not a pleasant #night# for a dip in the #sea# $m_dantès$ did not comprehend the jest but his #hair# stood erect on his #head#
well here we are at last said #one# of them a little farther a little farther said the #other#
you know very well that the last was stopped on his #way# dashed on the #rock# and the #governor# told us next #day# that we were careless #fellow#
they ascended five or six more #step# and then $m_dantès$ felt that they took him #one# by the #head# and the #other# by the heels and swung him to and fro
and at the same #instant# $m_dantès$ felt himself flung into the #air# like a wounded bird falling falling with a rapidity that made his #blood# curdle
although drawn downwards by the heavy weight which hastened his rapid descent it seemed to him as if the fall lasted for a century
at last with a horrible splash he darted like an arrow into the ice cold #water# and as he did so he uttered a shrill #cry# stifled in a #moment# by his immersion beneath the waves
$m_dantès$ had been flung into the #sea# and was dragged into its depths by a thirty six pound shot tied to his #foot#
#one# said the grave diggers two three the #sea# is the cemetery of the château if #chapter#
the #island# of tiboulen $m_dantès$ although stunned and almost suffocated had sufficient #presence# of #mind# to hold his breath and as his #right# #hand# prepared as he was for every #chance# held his knife open he rapidly ripped up the sack extricated his #arm# and then his #body# but in #spite# of all his #effort# to free himself from the shot he felt it dragging him down still lower
he then bent his #body# and by a desperate #effort# severed the cord that bound his legs at the #moment# when it seemed as if he were actually strangled
with a mighty leap he rose to the surface of the #sea# while the shot dragged down to the depths the sack that had so nearly become his shroud
$m_dantès$ waited only to get breath and then dived in #order# to avoid being seen when he arose a second #time# he was fifty paces from where he had first sunk
he saw overhead a black and tempestuous sky across which the wind was driving clouds that occasionally suffered a twinkling star to appear before him was the vast expanse of #water# sombre and terrible whose waves foamed and roared as if before the approach of a storm
behind him blacker than the #sea# blacker than the sky rose phantom like the vast #stone# structure whose projecting crags seemed like #arm# extended to seize their prey and on the highest #rock# was a torch lighting two figures
he fancied that these two forms were looking at the #sea# doubtless these strange grave diggers had heard his #cry# $m_dantès$ dived again and remained a long #time# beneath the #water#
this was an easy feat to him for he usually attracted a crowd of spectators in the bay before the lighthouse at marseilles when he swam there and was unanimously declared to be the best swimmer in the port
ratonneau and pomègue are the nearest #island# of all those that surround the château if but ratonneau and pomègue are inhabited as is also the islet of daume
when he came up again the #light# had disappeared he must now get his bearings tiboulen and lemaire were therefore the safest for $m_dantès$ venture
the #island# of tiboulen and lemaire are a league from the château if $m_dantès$ nevertheless determined to make for them but how could he find his #way# in the #darkness# of the #night#
by leaving this #light# on the #right# he kept the #island# of tiboulen a little on the left by turning to the left therefore he would find it
at this #moment# he saw the #light# of planier gleaming in front of him like a star but as we have said it was at least a league from the château if to this #island#
often in #prison# $abbé_faria$ had said to him when he saw him idle and inactive $m_dantès$ you must not give #way# to this listlessness you #will# be drowned if you seek to escape and your #strength# has not been properly exercised and prepared for exertion
these #word# rang in $m_dantès$ ears even beneath the waves he hastened to cleave his #way# through them to see if he had not lost his #strength#
he found with #pleasure# that his captivity had taken away #nothing# of his #power# and that he was still #master# of that element on whose bosom he had so often sported as a #boy#
he listened for any #sound# that might be audible and every #time# that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon and strove to penetrate the #darkness#
he fancied that every wave behind him was a pursuing #boat# and he redoubled his exertions increasing rapidly his #distance# from the château but exhausting his #strength#
#fear# that relentless pursuer clogged $m_dantès$ #effort# he swam on still and already the terrible château had disappeared in the #darkness#
he could not see it but he felt its #presence# an #hour# passed during which $m_dantès$ excited by the #feeling# of freedom continued to cleave the waves
i have swum above an #hour# but as the wind is against me that has retarded my speed however if i am not mistaken i must be close to tiboulen
he sought to tread #water# in #order# to #rest# himself but the #sea# was too violent and he felt that he could not make #use# of this #mean# of recuperation
let us see said he but what if i were mistaken a shudder passed over him well said he
i #will# swim on until i am worn out or the cramp seizes me and then i shall sink and he struck out with the energy of #despair#
suddenly the sky seemed to him to become still darker and more dense and heavy clouds seemed to sweep down towards him at the same #time# he felt a sharp pain in his knee
then he put out his #hand# and encountered an obstacle and with another stroke knew that he had gained the shore
before him rose a grotesque mass of #rock# that resembled #nothing# so much as a vast #fire# petrified at the #moment# of its most fervent combustion
he fancied for a #moment# that he had been shot and listened for the report but he heard #nothing# it was the #island# of tiboulen
$m_dantès$ rose advanced a few #step# and with a fervent prayer of gratitude stretched himself on the granite which seemed to him softer than down
then in #spite# of the wind and rain he fell into the deep sweet sleep of utter exhaustion at the expiration of an #hour# $edmond_dantès$ was awakened by the roar of thunder
the tempest was let loose and beating the atmosphere with its mighty wings from #time# to #time# a flash of lightning stretched across the heavens like a fiery serpent lighting up the clouds that rolled on in vast chaotic waves
he knew that it was barren and without shelter but when the #sea# became more calm he resolved to plunge into its waves again and swim to lemaire equally arid but larger and consequently better adapted for concealment
an overhanging #rock# offered him a temporary shelter and scarcely had he availed himself of it when the tempest burst forth in all its fury
$edmond_dantès$ felt the trembling of the #rock# beneath which he lay the waves dashing themselves against it wetted him with their spray
he was safely sheltered and yet he felt dizzy in the midst of the warring of the elements and the dazzling brightness of the lightning
it seemed to him that the #island# trembled to its base and that it would like a #vessel# at anchor break moorings and bear him off into the centre of the storm
$m_dantès$ had not been deceived he had reached the first of the two #island# which was in #fact# tiboulen he then recollected that he had not eaten or drunk for four and twenty #hour#
he extended his #hand# and drank greedily of the rainwater that had lodged in a hollow of the #rock# as he rose a flash of lightning that seemed to rive the remotest heights of heaven illumined the #darkness#
by its #light# between the #island# of lemaire and cape croiselle a #quarter# of a league distant $m_dantès$ saw a fishing #boat# driven rapidly like a spectre before the #power# of winds and waves
a second after he saw it again approaching with frightful rapidity $m_dantès$ cried at the top of his #voice# to warn them of their danger but they saw it themselves
another flash showed him four #man# clinging to the shattered mast and the rigging while a fifth clung to the broken rudder
above the splintered mast a sail rent to tatters was waving suddenly the ropes that still held it gave #way# and it disappeared in the #darkness# of the #night# like a vast #sea# bird
the #man# he beheld saw him undoubtedly for their #cry# were carried to his ears by the wind at the same #moment# a violent crash was heard and #cry# of distress
$m_dantès$ from his rocky perch saw the shattered #vessel# and among the fragments the floating forms of the hapless #sailor# then all was dark again
$m_dantès$ ran down the #rock# at the risk of being himself dashed to #piece# he listened he groped about but he heard and saw #nothing# the #cry# had ceased and the tempest continued to rage
by degrees the wind abated vast gray clouds rolled towards the west and the blue firmament appeared studded with bright stars
soon a red streak became visible in the horizon the waves whitened a #light# played over them and gilded their foaming crests with #gold#
$m_dantès$ stood mute and motionless before this majestic spectacle as if he now beheld it for the first #time# and indeed since his captivity in the château if he had forgotten that such #scene# were ever to be witnessed
it was #day# he turned towards the fortress and looked at both #sea# and land the gloomy building rose from the bosom of the ocean with imposing majesty and seemed to dominate the #scene#
the turnkey #will# enter my #chamber# find the #body# of my poor #friend# recognize it seek for me in vain and give the alarm
then the tunnel #will# be discovered the #man# who cast me into the #sea# and who must have heard the #cry# i uttered #will# be questioned
it was about five clock the #sea# continued to get calmer in two or three #hour# #thought# $m_dantès$ then #boat# filled with armed #soldier# #will# pursue the wretched fugitive
the cannon #will# warn #everyone# to refuse shelter to a #man# wandering about naked and famished the #police# of marseilles #will# be on the alert by land whilst the #governor# pursues me by #sea#
i am cold i am hungry i have lost even the knife that saved me oh my god i have suffered enough surely
as $m_dantès$ his #eye# turned in the direction of the château if uttered this prayer he saw off the farther #point# of the #island# of pomègue a small #vessel# with lateen sail skimming the #sea# like a gull in search of prey and with his #sailor# #eye# he knew it to be a genoese tartan
she was coming out of marseilles harbor and was standing out to #sea# rapidly her sharp prow cleaving through the waves
oh cried $edmond_dantès$ to think that in #half# an #hour# i could join her did i not #fear# being questioned detected and conveyed back to marseilles
have #pity# on me and do for me what i am unable to do for myself what can i do
under pretext of trading along the coast these #man# who are in reality smugglers #will# prefer selling me to doing a good action
what #story# can i invent i must wait but i cannot i am starving in a few #hour# my #strength# #will# be utterly exhausted besides perhaps i have not been missed at the fortress
i can pass as #one# of the #sailor# wrecked last #night# my #story# #will# be accepted for there is no #one# left to contradict me
the red cap of #one# of the #sailor# hung to a #point# of the #rock# and some timbers that had formed #part# of the #vessel# keel floated at the #foot# of the crag
as he spoke $m_dantès$ looked toward the #spot# where the fishing #vessel# had been wrecked and started in an #instant# $m_dantès$ #plan# was formed
he swam to the cap placed it on his #head# seized #one# of the timbers and struck out so as to cut across the #course# the #vessel# was taking
he soon saw that the #vessel# with the wind dead ahead was tacking between the château if and the tower of planier
for an #instant# he feared lest instead of keeping in shore she should stand out to #sea# but he soon saw that she would pass like most #vessel# bound for italy between the #island# of jaros and calaseraigne
however the #vessel# and the swimmer insensibly neared #one# another and in #one# of its tacks the tartan bore down within a #quarter# of a mile of him
he rose on the waves making #sign# of distress but no #one# on #board# saw him and the #vessel# stood on another tack
i am saved murmured he and this conviction restored his #strength# $m_dantès$ would have shouted but he knew that the wind would drown his #voice#
it was then he rejoiced at his precaution in taking the timber for without it he would have been unable perhaps to reach the #vessel# certainly to #return# to shore should he be unsuccessful in attracting #attention#
$m_dantès$ though almost sure as to what #course# the #vessel# would take had yet watched it anxiously until it tacked and stood towards him
by a violent #effort# he rose #half# out of the #water# waving his cap and uttering a loud shout peculiar to #sailor#
then he advanced but before they could meet the #vessel# again changed her #course# this #time# he was both seen and heard and the tartan instantly steered towards him
at the same #time# he saw they were about to lower the #boat# an #instant# after the #boat# rowed by two #man# advanced rapidly towards him
but he had reckoned too much upon his #strength# and then he realized how serviceable the timber had been to him
$m_dantès$ let go of the timber which he now #thought# to be useless and swam vigorously to meet them his #arm# became stiff his legs lost their flexibility and he was almost breathless
the #word# reached his ear as a wave which he no longer had the #strength# to surmount passed over his #head#
he rose again to the surface struggled with the last desperate #effort# of a drowning #man# uttered a third #cry# and felt himself sinking as if the fatal cannon shot were again tied to his #foot#
he shouted again the two #sailor# redoubled their #effort# and #one# of them cried in italian courage the #water# passed over his #head# and the sky turned gray
a convulsive movement again brought him to the surface he felt himself seized by the #hair# then he saw and heard #nothing#
he had fainted when he opened his #eye# $m_dantès$ found himself on the deck of the tartan his first #care# was to see what #course# they were taking
they were rapidly leaving the château if behind $m_dantès$ was so exhausted that the exclamation of #joy# he uttered was mistaken for a sigh
a #sailor# was rubbing his limbs with a woollen cloth another whom he recognized as the #one# who had cried out courage held a gourd full of rum to his mouth while the third an old #sailor# at once the pilot and #captain# looked on with that egotistical #pity# #man# feel for a #misfortune# that they have escaped #yesterday# and which may overtake them #tomorrow#
as we have said he was lying on the deck a few drops of the rum restored suspended animation while the friction of his limbs restored their elasticity
who are you said the pilot in bad french i am replied $m_dantès$ in bad italian a maltese #sailor#
we were coming from syracuse laden with grain the storm of last #night# overtook us at cape morgiou and we were wrecked on these #rock#
from these #rock# that i had the good luck to cling to while our #captain# and the #rest# of the crew were all lost
i saw your #vessel# and fearful of being left to perish on the desolate #island# i swam off on a #piece# of wreckage to try and intercept your #course#
where do you come from you have saved my #life# and i #thank# you continued $m_dantès$ i was lost when #one# of your #sailor# caught hold of my #hair#
it was i said a #sailor# of a frank and manly #appearance# and it was #time# for you were sinking
i almost hesitated though replied the #sailor# you looked more like a brigand than an honest #man# with your beard six inches and your #hair# a #foot# long
yes returned $m_dantès$ holding out his #hand# i #thank# you again $m_dantès$ recollected that his #hair# and beard had not been cut all the #time# he was at the château if
i made a vow to our #lady# of the grotto not to cut my #hair# or beard for ten #year# if i were saved in a #moment# of danger but #today# the vow expires
yes said he now what are we to do with you said the #captain# alas #anything# you please
my #captain# is dead i have barely escaped but i am a good #sailor# leave me at the first port you make i shall be sure to find employment
do you know the mediterranean i have sailed over it since my childhood you know the best harbors
there are few ports that i could not enter or leave with a bandage over my #eye#
i say #captain# said the #sailor# who had cried courage to $m_dantès$ if what he says is true what hinders his staying with us
if he says true said the #captain# doubtingly but in his present condition he #will# #promise# #anything# and take his #chance# of keeping it afterwards
i #will# do more than i #promise# said $m_dantès$ we shall see returned the #other# smiling where are you going asked $m_dantès$
to leghorn then why instead of tacking so frequently do you not sail nearer the wind because we should run straight on to the #island# of rion
you shall pass it by twenty fathoms take the helm and let us see what you know
the young #man# took the helm felt to see if the #vessel# answered the rudder promptly and seeing that without being a first rate #sailor# she yet was tolerably obedient
to the sheets said he the four seamen who composed the crew obeyed while the pilot looked on haul taut
they obeyed belay this #order# was also executed and the #vessel# passed as $m_dantès$ had predicted twenty fathoms to windward
and they all looked with #astonishment# at this #man# whose #eye# now disclosed an intelligence and his #body# a vigor they had not #thought# him capable of showing
bravo said the #captain# bravo repeated the #sailor# you see said $m_dantès$ quitting the helm
if you do not want me at leghorn you can leave me there and i #will# pay you out of the first wages i get for my food and the clothes you lend me
i shall be of some #use# to you at least during the voyage ah said the #captain# we can agree very well if you are reasonable
give me what you give the #other# and it #will# be all #right# returned $m_dantès$ that not fair said the seaman who had saved $m_dantès$ for you know more than we do
what is that to you $jacopo_manfredi$ returned the #captain# #everyone# is free to ask what he pleases
that true replied $jacopo_manfredi$ i only make a remark well you would do much better to find him a jacket and a pair of trousers if you have them
no said $jacopo_manfredi$ but i have a shirt and a pair of trousers that is all i want interrupted $m_dantès$
$jacopo_manfredi$ dived into the hold and soon returned with what $edmond_dantès$ wanted now then do you #wish# for #anything# else said the patron
a #piece# of bread and another #glass# of the capital rum i tasted for i have not eaten or drunk for a long #time#
he had not tasted food for forty #hour# a #piece# of bread was brought and $jacopo_manfredi$ offered him the gourd
larboard your helm cried the #captain# to the steersman $m_dantès$ glanced that #way# as he lifted the gourd to his mouth then paused with #hand# in mid #air#
hollo what the #matter# at the château if said the #captain# a small white cloud which had attracted $m_dantès$ #attention# crowned the summit of the bastion of the château if
at the same #moment# the faint report of a gun was heard the #sailor# looked at #one# another what is this asked the #captain#
the #captain# glanced at him but he had lifted the rum to his #lip# and was drinking it with so much composure that suspicions if the #captain# had any died away
a #prisoner# has escaped from the château if and they are firing the alarm gun replied $m_dantès$ pretty strong rum
said $m_dantès$ wiping his #brow# with his sleeve at any rate murmured he if it be so much the better for i have made a rare acquisition
under pretence of being fatigued $m_dantès$ asked to take the helm the steersman glad to be relieved looked at the #captain# and the latter by a #sign# indicated that he might abandon it to his new comrade
$m_dantès$ could thus keep his #eye# on marseilles what is the #day# of the #month# asked he of $jacopo_manfredi$ who sat down beside him
the th of february in what #year# in what #year# you ask me in what #year#
yes replied the young #man# i ask you in what #year# you have forgotten then i got such a fright last #night# replied $m_dantès$ smiling that i have almost lost my memory
i ask you what #year# is it the #year# returned $jacopo_manfredi$ it was fourteen #year# #day# for #day# since $m_dantès$ arrest
he was nineteen when he entered the château if he was thirty three when he escaped a sorrowful #smile# passed over his #face# he asked himself what had become of $mercédès$ who must believe him dead
then his #eye# lighted up with hatred as he #thought# of the three #man# who had caused him so long and wretched a captivity
this oath was no longer a vain menace for the fastest #sailor# in the mediterranean would have been unable to overtake the little tartan that with every stitch of canvas set was flying before the wind to leghorn
the smugglers $m_dantès$ had not been a #day# on #board# before he had a very clear #idea# of the #man# with whom his lot had been cast
without having been in the school of the $abbé_faria$ the worthy #master# of $la_jeune_amélie$ the #name# of the genoese tartan knew a smattering of all the tongues spoken on the shores of that large lake called the mediterranean from the arabic to the provençal and this while it spared him interpreters #person# always troublesome and frequently indiscreet gave him great facilities of communication either with the #vessel# he met at #sea# with the small #boat# sailing along the coast or with the #people# without #name# #country# or occupation who are always seen on the quays of seaports and who live by hidden and mysterious #mean# which we must suppose to be a direct gift of providence as they have no visible #mean# of support
he renewed against $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_fernand_mondego$ and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the oath of implacable vengeance he had made in his dungeon #chapter# it is fair to assume that $m_dantès$ was on #board# a smuggler
he was very well known to the customs #officer# of the coast and as there was between these worthies and himself a perpetual battle of wits he had at first #thought# that $m_dantès$ might be an emissary of these industrious guardians of #right# and #duty# who perhaps employed this ingenious #mean# of learning some of the #secret# of his trade
but the skilful #manner# in which $m_dantès$ had handled the lugger had entirely reassured him and then when he saw the #light# plume of smoke floating above the bastion of the château if and heard the distant report he was instantly struck with the #idea# that he had on #board# his #vessel# #one# whose coming and going like that of #king# was accompanied with salutes of artillery
this made him less uneasy it must be owned than if the new comer had proved to be a customs #officer# but this supposition also disappeared like the first when he beheld the perfect tranquillity of his recruit
$edmond_dantès$ thus had the advantage of knowing what the owner was without the owner knowing who he was and however the old #sailor# and his crew tried to pump him they extracted #nothing# more from him he gave accurate descriptions of naples and malta which he knew as well as marseilles and held stoutly to his first #story#
thus the genoese subtle as he was was duped by $edmond_dantès$ in whose favor his mild demeanor his nautical skill and his admirable dissimulation pleaded
moreover it is possible that the genoese was #one# of those shrewd #person# who know #nothing# but what they should know and believe #nothing#
at first the #captain# had received $m_dantès$ on #board# with a certain degree of distrust but what they should believe in this state of mutual understanding they reached leghorn
here $edmond_dantès$ was to undergo another trial he was to find out whether he could recognize himself as he had not seen his own #face# for fourteen #year#
he had preserved a tolerably good remembrance of what the youth had been and was now to find out what the #man# had become
as he had twenty #time# touched at leghorn he remembered a barber in st ferdinand #street# he went there to have his beard and #hair# cut
the barber gazed in amazement at this #man# with the long thick and black #hair# and beard which gave his #head# the #appearance# of #one# of titian portraits
at this period it was not the fashion to wear so large a beard and #hair# so long now a barber would only be surprised if a #man# gifted with such advantages should consent voluntarily to deprive himself of them
when the operation was concluded and $edmond_dantès$ felt that his chin was completely smooth and his #hair# reduced to its usual #length# he asked for a looking #glass#
he was now as we have said three and thirty #year# of #age# and his fourteen #year# imprisonment had produced a great transformation in his #appearance#
$m_dantès$ had entered the château if with the round open smiling #face# of a young and happy #man# with whom the early paths of #life# have been smooth and who anticipates a future corresponding with his past
his comrades believed that his vow was fulfilled the leghorn barber said #nothing# and went to #work# this was now all changed
the oval #face# was lengthened his smiling mouth had assumed the firm and marked #line# which betoken resolution his eyebrows were arched beneath a #brow# furrowed with #thought# his #eye# were full of melancholy and from their depths occasionally sparkled gloomy #fire# of misanthropy and hatred his complexion so long kept from the sun had now that pale color which produces when the #feature# are encircled with black #hair# the aristocratic beauty of the #man# of the north the profound learning he had acquired had besides diffused over his #feature# a refined intellectual #expression# and he had also acquired being naturally of a goodly stature that vigor which a frame possesses which has so long concentrated all its force within itself
as to his #voice# prayers sobs and imprecations had changed it so that at #time# it was of a singularly penetrating sweetness and at #other# rough and almost hoarse
moreover from being so long in twilight or #darkness# his #eye# had acquired the faculty of distinguishing objects in the #night# common to the hyena and the wolf
to the elegance of a nervous and slight form had succeeded the solidity of a rounded and muscular figure $edmond_dantès$ smiled when he beheld himself it was impossible that his best #friend#
the #master# of $la_jeune_amélie$ who was very desirous of retaining amongst his crew a #man# of $edmond_dantès$ value had offered to advance him funds out of his future profits which $edmond_dantès$ had accepted
his next #care# on leaving the barber who had achieved his first metamorphosis was to enter a shop and buy a complete #sailor#
if indeed he had any #friend# left could recognize him he could not recognize himself suit a garb as we all know very simple and consisting of white trousers a striped shirt and a cap
it was in this #costume# and bringing back to $jacopo_manfredi$ the shirt and trousers he had lent him that $edmond_dantès$ reappeared before the #captain# of the lugger who had made him tell his #story# over and over again before he could believe him or recognize in the neat and trim #sailor# the #man# with thick and matted beard #hair# tangled with seaweed and #body# soaking in seabrine whom he had picked up naked and nearly drowned
attracted by his prepossessing #appearance# he renewed his offers of an engagement to $m_dantès$ but $m_dantès$ who had his own projects would not agree for a longer #time# than three #month#
he had scarcely been a week at leghorn before the hold of his #vessel# was filled with printed muslins contraband cottons english powder and tobacco on which the excise had forgotten to put its mark
the #master# was to get all this out of leghorn free of #duty# and land it on the shores of corsica where certain speculators undertook to forward the cargo to france
they sailed $edmond_dantès$ was again cleaving the azure #sea# which had been the first horizon of his youth and which he had so often dreamed of in #prison#
he left gorgone on his #right# and la pianosa on his left and went towards the #country# of paoli and $napoleon$
the next #morning# going on deck as he always did at an early #hour# the patron found $m_dantès$ leaning against the bulwarks gazing with intense earnestness at a pile of granite #rock# which the rising sun tinged with rosy #light#
$la_jeune_amélie$ had a very active crew very obedient to their #captain# who lost as little #time# as possible it was the #island# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
$m_dantès$ #thought# as they passed so closely to the #island# whose #name# was so interesting to him that he had only to leap into the #sea# and in #half# an #hour# be at the promised land
$la_jeune_amélie$ left it three #quarter# of a league to the larboard and kept on for corsica but then what could he do without instruments to discover his #treasure# without #arm# to defend himself
fortunately $m_dantès$ had learned how to wait he had waited fourteen #year# for his #liberty# and now he was free he could wait at least six #month# or a #year# for wealth
besides what would the #sailor# say what would the patron think he must wait would he not have accepted #liberty# without riches if it had been offered to him
it is true the #letter# of the $cardinal_spada$ was singularly circumstantial and $m_dantès$ repeated it to himself from #one# #end# to the #other# for he had not forgotten a #word#
besides were not those riches chimerical offspring of the brain of the poor $abbé_faria$ had they not died with him
m #evening# came and $edmond_dantès$ saw the #island# tinged with the shades of twilight and then disappear in the #darkness# from all #eye# but his own for he with vision accustomed to the gloom of a #prison# continued to behold it last of all for he remained alone upon deck
the next morn broke off the coast of aleria all #day# they coasted and in the #evening# saw #fire# lighted on land the #position# of these was no #doubt# a signal for landing for a ship
lantern was hung up at the mast #head# instead of the streamer and they came to within a gunshot of the shore
$m_dantès$ noticed that the #captain# of $la_jeune_amélie$ had as he neared the land mounted two small culverins which without making much #noise# can throw a four ounce ball a thousand paces or so
four shallops came off with very little #noise# alongside the lugger which no #doubt# in acknowledgement of the compliment lowered her own shallop into the #sea# and the five #boat# worked so well that by two clock in the #morning# all the cargo was out of $la_jeune_amélie$ and on terra firma
the same #night# such a #man# of regularity was the patron of $la_jeune_amélie$ the profits were divided and each #man# had a hundred tuscan livres or about eighty #franc#
but on this occasion the precaution was superfluous and #everything# proceeded with the utmost smoothness and politeness but the voyage was not ended
they turned the bowsprit towards sardinia where they intended to take in a cargo which was to replace what had been discharged
this new cargo was destined for the coast of the duchy of lucca and consisted almost entirely of havana cigars sherry and malaga wines
there they had a bit of a skirmish in getting rid of the #duty# the excise was in #truth# the everlasting #enemy# of the patron of $la_jeune_amélie$
a customs #officer# was laid low and two #sailor# wounded $m_dantès$ was #one# of the latter a ball having touched him in the left #shoulder#
$m_dantès$ was almost glad of this affray and almost pleased at being wounded for they were rude lessons which taught him with what #eye# he could view danger and with what endurance he could bear suffering
the second operation was as successful as the first $la_jeune_amélie$ was in luck he had contemplated danger with a #smile# and when wounded had exclaimed with the great philosopher
he had moreover looked upon the customs #officer# wounded to #death# and whether from heat of #blood# produced by the encounter or the chill of human sentiment this #sight# had made but slight impression upon him
$m_dantès$ was on the #way# he desired to follow and was moving towards the #end# he wished to achieve his #heart# was in a fair #way# of petrifying in his bosom
$jacopo_manfredi$ seeing him fall had believed him killed and rushing towards him raised him up and then attended to him with all the kindness of a devoted comrade
this #world# was not then so good as #doctor# pangloss believed it neither was it so wicked as $m_dantès$ #thought# it since this #man# who had #nothing# to expect from his comrade but the inheritance of his share of the prize #money# manifested so much sorrow when he saw him fall
fortunately as we have said $edmond_dantès$ was only wounded and with certain herbs gathered at certain seasons and sold to the smugglers by the old sardinian #woman# the wound soon closed
$edmond_dantès$ then resolved to try $jacopo_manfredi$ and offered him in #return# for his #attention# a share of his prize #money# but $jacopo_manfredi$ refused it indignantly
as a result of the sympathetic devotion which $jacopo_manfredi$ had from the first bestowed on $edmond_dantès$ the latter was moved to a certain degree of affection
pain thou art not an evil but this sufficed for $jacopo_manfredi$ who instinctively felt that $edmond_dantès$ had a #right# to superiority of #position#
a superiority which $edmond_dantès$ had concealed from all #other# and from this #time# the kindness which $edmond_dantès$ showed him was enough for the brave seaman
then in the long #day# on #board# ship when the #vessel# gliding on with security over the azure #sea# required no #care# but the #hand# of the helmsman #thank# to the favorable winds that swelled her sails $edmond_dantès$ with a chart in his #hand# became the instructor of $jacopo_manfredi$ as the poor $abbé_faria$ had been his tutor
he pointed out to him the bearings of the coast explained to him the variations of the compass and taught him to read in that vast book opened over our #head# which they call heaven and where god writes in azure with #letter# of #diamond#
and when $jacopo_manfredi$ inquired of him what is the #use# of teaching all these #thing# to a poor #sailor# like me $edmond_dantès$ replied
who knows you may #one# #day# be the #captain# of a #vessel# your #fellow# countryman $bonaparte$ became emperor we had forgotten to say that $jacopo_manfredi$ was a corsican
two #month# and a #half# elapsed in these trips and $edmond_dantès$ had become as skilful a coaster as he had been a hardy seaman
he had formed an acquaintance with all the smugglers on the coast and learned all the masonic #sign# by which these #half# pirates recognize each #other#
he had passed and re passed his #island# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ twenty #time# but not once had he found an opportunity of landing there
as soon as his engagement with the patron of $la_jeune_amélie$ ended he would hire a small #vessel# on his own #account# for in his several voyages he had amassed a hundred piastres and under some pretext land at the #island# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
then he would be free to make his researches not perhaps entirely at #liberty# for he would be doubtless watched by those who accompanied him
he then formed a resolution but in this #world# we must risk #something# #prison# had made $edmond_dantès$ prudent and he was desirous of running no risk whatever
but in vain did he rack his imagination fertile as it was he could not devise any #plan# for reaching the #island# without companionship
$m_dantès$ was tossed about on these #doubt# and #wish# when the patron who had great confidence in him and was very desirous of retaining him in his #service# took him by the #arm# #one# #evening# and led him to a tavern on the via del oglio where the leading smugglers of leghorn used to congregate and discuss #affair# connected with their trade
already $m_dantès$ had visited this maritime bourse two or three #time# and seeing all these hardy free traders who supplied the whole coast for nearly two hundred leagues in extent he had asked himself what #power# might not that #man# attain who should give the impulse of his #will# to all these #contrary# and diverging #mind#
this #time# it was a great #matter# that was under discussion connected with a #vessel# laden with turkey carpets stuffs of the levant and cashmeres
it was necessary to find some neutral #ground# on which an exchange could be made and then to try and land these goods on the coast of france
if the venture was successful the profit would be enormous there would be a gain of fifty or sixty piastres each for the crew
the patron of $la_jeune_amélie$ proposed as a #place# of landing the #island# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ which being completely deserted and having neither #soldier# nor revenue #officer# seemed to have been placed in the midst of the ocean since the #time# of the heathen olympus by mercury the god of merchants and robbers classes of mankind which we in modern #time# have separated if not made distinct but which antiquity appears to have included in the same category
at the mention of $m_de_monte_cristo$ $m_dantès$ started with #joy# he rose to conceal his #emotion# and took a #turn# around the smoky tavern where all the languages of the known #world# were jumbled in a lingua franca
when he again joined the two #person# who had been discussing the #matter# it had been decided that they should touch at $m_de_monte_cristo$ and set out on the following #night#
$edmond_dantès$ being consulted was of #opinion# that the #island# afforded every possible security and that great enterprises to be well done should be done quickly
#nothing# then was altered in the #plan# and #order# were given to get under weigh next #night# and wind and weather permitting to make the neutral #island# by the following #day#
thus at #length# by #one# of the unexpected strokes of #fortune# which sometimes befall those who have for a long #time# been the victims of an evil destiny
$m_dantès$ was about to secure the opportunity he wished for by simple and natural #mean# and land on the #island# without incurring any suspicion
#chapter# the #island# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ #one# #night# more and he would be on his #way# the #night# was #one# of feverish distraction and in its progress visions good and evil passed through $m_dantès$ #mind#
if he closed his #eye# he saw $cardinal_spada$ #letter# written on the #wall# in characters of flame if he slept for a #moment# the wildest #dream# haunted his brain
he ascended into grottos paved with emeralds with panels of rubies and the roof glowing with #diamond# stalactites pearls fell drop by drop as subterranean #water# filter in their caves
$edmond_dantès$ amazed wonderstruck filled his #pocket# with the radiant gems and then returned to daylight when he discovered that his prizes had all changed into common pebbles
he then endeavored to re enter the marvellous grottos but they had suddenly receded and now the path became a labyrinth and then the entrance vanished and in vain did he tax his memory for the magic and mysterious #word# which opened the splendid caverns of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ baba to the arabian fisherman
all was useless the #treasure# disappeared and had again reverted to the genii from whom for a #moment# he had hoped to carry it off
the #day# came at #length# and was almost as feverish as the #night# had been but it brought #reason# to the aid of imagination and $m_dantès$ was then enabled to arrange a #plan# which had hitherto been vague and unsettled in his brain
he had by degrees assumed such authority over his #companion# that he was almost like a commander on #board# and as his #order# were always clear distinct and easy of execution his comrades obeyed him with celerity and #pleasure#
#night# came and with it the preparation for departure and these preparations served to conceal $m_dantès$ agitation the old patron did not interfere for he too had recognized the superiority of $m_dantès$ over the crew and himself
he saw in the young #man# his natural successor and regretted that he had not a #daughter# that he might have bound $edmond_dantès$ to him by a more secure alliance
at seven clock in the #evening# all was ready and at ten #minute# past seven they doubled the lighthouse just as the beacon was kindled
the #sea# was calm and with a fresh breeze from the south east they sailed beneath a bright blue sky in which god also lighted up in #turn# his beacon #light# each of which is a #world#
when the maltese for so they called $m_dantès$ had said this it was sufficient and all went to their bunks contentedly
$m_dantès$ cast from solitude into the #world# frequently experienced an imperious #desire# for solitude and what solitude is more complete or more poetical than that of a ship floating in isolation on the #sea# during the obscurity of the #night# in the #silence# of immensity and under the #eye# of heaven
now this solitude was peopled with his #thought# the #night# lighted up by his illusions and the #silence# animated by his anticipations
$m_dantès$ told them that all #hand# might #turn# in and he would take the helm this frequently happened when the patron awoke the #vessel# was hurrying on with every sail set and every sail full with the breeze
$edmond_dantès$ resigned the lugger to the #master# #care# and went and lay down in his hammock but in #spite# of a sleepless #night# he could not close his #eye# for a #moment#
they were making nearly ten knots an #hour# the #island# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ loomed large in the horizon two #hour# afterwards he came on deck as the #boat# was about to double the #island# of $elba$
they were just abreast of mareciana and beyond the flat but verdant #island# of la pianosa the peak of $m_de_monte_cristo$ reddened by the burning sun was seen against the azure sky
$m_dantès$ ordered the helmsman to put down his helm in #order# to leave la pianosa to starboard as he knew that he should shorten his #course# by two or three knots
the #island# was distinct and #everything# on it was plainly perceptible owing to that clearness of the atmosphere peculiar to the #light# which the rays of the sun cast at its setting
$edmond_dantès$ gazed very earnestly at the mass of #rock# which gave out all the variety of twilight colors from the brightest pink to the deepest blue and from #time# to #time# his cheeks flushed his #brow# darkened and a mist passed over his #eye#
never did a gamester whose whole #fortune# is staked on #one# cast of the die experience the anguish which $edmond_dantès$ felt in his paroxysms of #hope#
about five clock in the #evening# #night# came and at ten clock they anchored $la_jeune_amélie$ was first at the rendezvous
he was the first to jump on shore and had he dared he would like lucius brutus have kissed his #mother# #earth#
it was dark but at eleven clock the moon rose in the midst of the ocean whose every wave she silvered and then ascending high played in floods of pale #light# on the rocky hills of this second pelion
in #spite# of his usual command over himself $m_dantès$ could not restrain his impetuosity the #island# was familiar to the crew of $la_jeune_amélie$ it was #one# of her regular haunts
as to $m_dantès$ he had passed it on his voyage to and from the levant but never touched at it he questioned $jacopo_manfredi$
where shall we pass the #night# he inquired why on #board# the tartan replied the #sailor# should we not do better in the grottos
what grottos why the grottos caves of the #island# i do not know of any grottos replied $jacopo_manfredi$
the cold sweat sprang forth on $m_dantès$ #brow# what are there no grottos at $m_de_monte_cristo$ he asked none
for a #moment# $m_dantès$ was speechless then he remembered that these caves might have been filled up by some accident or even stopped up for the sake of greater security by $cardinal_spada$
the #point# was then to discover the hidden entrance it was useless to search at #night# and $m_dantès$ therefore delayed all investigation until the #morning#
besides a signal made #half# a league out at #sea# and to which $la_jeune_amélie$ replied by a similar signal indicated that the #moment# for #business# had come
the #boat# that now arrived assured by the answering signal that all was well soon came in #sight# white and silent as a phantom and cast anchor within a cable #length# of shore
$m_dantès$ reflected as he worked on the shout of #joy# which with a single #word# he could evoke from all these #man# if he gave utterance to the #one# unchanging #thought# that pervaded his #heart# but far from disclosing this precious #secret# he almost feared that he had already said too much and by his restlessness and continual #question# his #minute# observations and evident preoccupation aroused suspicions
fortunately as regarded this #circumstance# at least his painful past gave to his #countenance# an indelible sadness and the glimmerings of gayety seen beneath this cloud were indeed but transitory
no #one# had the slightest suspicion and when next #day# taking a fowling #piece# powder and shot $m_dantès$ declared his intention to go and kill some of the wild goats that were seen springing from #rock# to #rock# his #wish# was construed into a #love# of sport or a #desire# for solitude
however $jacopo_manfredi$ insisted on following him and $m_dantès$ did not oppose this fearing if he did so that he might incur distrust
scarcely however had they gone a #quarter# of a league when having killed a kid he begged $jacopo_manfredi$ to take it to his comrades and request them to cook it and when ready to let him know by firing a gun
then the landing began this and some dried fruits and a flask of monte pulciano was the bill of fare $m_dantès$ went on looking from #time# to #time# behind and around about him
having reached the summit of a #rock# he saw a thousand #foot# beneath him his #companion# whom $jacopo_manfredi$ had rejoined and who were all busy preparing the repast which $edmond_dantès$ skill as a marksman had augmented with a capital dish
$edmond_dantès$ looked at them for a #moment# with the sad and gentle #smile# of a #man# superior to his #fellow#
in two #hour# #time# said he these #person# #will# depart richer by fifty piastres each to go and risk their #life# again by endeavoring to gain fifty more then they #will# #return# with a #fortune# of six hundred #franc# and waste this #treasure# in some city with the pride of sultans and the insolence of nabobs
yet perchance #tomorrow# deception #will# so act on me that i shall on compulsion consider such a contemptible #possession# as the utmost #happiness#
at this #moment# #hope# makes me despise their riches which seem to me contemptible oh no exclaimed $edmond_dantès$ that #will# not be
the wise unerring $abbé_faria$ could not be mistaken in this #one# #thing# besides it were better to die than to continue to lead this low and wretched #life#
thus $m_dantès$ who but three #month# before had no #desire# but #liberty# had now not #liberty# enough and panted for wealth
the cause was not in $m_dantès$ but in providence who while limiting the #power# of #man# has filled him with boundless #desire#
meanwhile by a cleft between two #wall# of #rock# following a path worn by a torrent and which in all human probability human #foot# had never before trod $m_dantès$ approached the #spot# where he supposed the grottos must have existed
keeping along the shore and examining the smallest object with serious #attention# he #thought# he could trace on certain #rock# marks made by the #hand# of #man#
#time# which encrusts all physical substances with its mossy mantle as it invests all #thing# of the #mind# with forgetfulness seemed to have respected these #sign# which apparently had been made with some degree of regularity and probably with a definite #purpose#
occasionally the marks were hidden under tufts of myrtle which spread into large bushes laden with blossoms or beneath parasitical lichen
so $edmond_dantès$ had to separate the branches or brush away the moss to know where the guide marks were the #sight# of marks renewed $edmond_dantès$ fondest #hope#
might it not have been the cardinal himself who had first traced them in #order# that they might serve as a guide for his nephew in the #event# of a catastrophe which he could not foresee would have been so complete
only might not these betraying marks have attracted #other# #eye# than those for whom they were made and had the dark and wondrous #island# indeed faithfully guarded its precious #secret#
it seemed however to $edmond_dantès$ who was hidden from his comrades by the inequalities of the #ground# that at sixty paces from the harbor the marks ceased nor did they terminate at any grotto
this solitary #place# was precisely suited to the requirements of a #man# desirous of burying #treasure# a large round #rock# placed solidly on its base was the only #spot# to which they seemed to lead
$edmond_dantès$ concluded that perhaps instead of having reached the #end# of the route he had only explored its beginning and he therefore turned round and retraced his #step#
meanwhile his comrades had prepared the repast had got some #water# from a spring spread out the fruit and bread and cooked the kid
just at the #moment# when they were taking the dainty animal from the spit they saw $edmond_dantès$ springing with the boldness of a chamois from #rock# to #rock# and they fired the signal agreed upon
but even while they watched his daring progress $edmond_dantès$ #foot# slipped and they saw him stagger on the edge of a #rock# and disappear
the sportsman instantly changed his direction and ran quickly towards them they all rushed towards him for all loved $edmond_dantès$ in #spite# of his superiority yet $jacopo_manfredi$ reached him first
they poured a little rum down his throat and this remedy which had before been so beneficial to him produced the same #effect# as formerly
$edmond_dantès$ opened his #eye# complained of great pain in his knee a #feeling# of heaviness in his #head# and severe pains in his loins
they wished to carry him to the shore but when they touched him although under $jacopo_manfredi$ directions he declared with heavy groans that he could not bear to be moved
it may be supposed that $m_dantès$ did not now think of his #dinner# but he insisted that his comrades who had not his #reason# for fasting should have their meal
he found $edmond_dantès$ lying prone bleeding and almost senseless he had rolled down a declivity of twelve or fifteen #foot# as for himself he declared that he had only need of a little #rest# and
that when they returned he should be easier the #sailor# did not require much urging they were hungry and the smell of the roasted kid was very savory and your tars are not very ceremonious
all that $edmond_dantès$ had been able to do was to drag himself about a dozen paces forward to lean against a moss grown #rock#
the old patron who was obliged to sail in the #morning# in #order# to land his cargo on the frontiers of piedmont and france between nice and fréjus urged $m_dantès$ to try and rise
an #hour# afterwards they returned but instead of growing easier $m_dantès$ pains appeared to increase in violence $edmond_dantès$ made great exertions in #order# to comply but at each #effort# he fell back moaning and turning pale
he has broken his ribs said the commander in a low #voice# no #matter# he is an excellent #fellow# and we must not leave him
$m_dantès$ declared however that he would rather die where he was than undergo the agony which the slightest movement cost him
we #will# try and carry him on #board# the tartan well said the patron let what may happen it shall never be said that we deserted a good comrade like you
the patron was so strict that this was the first #time# they had ever seen him give up an enterprise or even delay in its execution
we #will# not go till #evening# this very much astonished the #sailor# although not #one# opposed it $m_dantès$ would not allow that any such infraction of regular and proper rules should be made in his favor
no no he said to the patron i was awkward and it is just that i pay the penalty of my clumsiness
leave me a small supply of biscuit a gun powder and balls to kill the kids or defend myself at need and a pickaxe that i may build a shelter if you delay in coming back for me
but you ll die of hunger said the patron i would rather do so was $edmond_dantès$ reply than suffer the inexpressible agonies which the slightest movement causes me
the patron turned towards his #vessel# which was rolling on the swell in the little harbor and with sails partly set would be ready for #sea# when her toilet should be completed
what are we to do maltese asked the #captain# we cannot leave you here so and yet we cannot stay
go go exclaimed $m_dantès$ we shall be absent at least a week said the patron and then we must run out of our #course# to come here and take you up again
why said $m_dantès$ if in two or three #day# you hail any fishing #boat# #desire# them to come here to me
i #will# pay twenty five piastres for my passage back to leghorn if you do not come across #one# #return# for me
the patron shook his #head# listen #captain# baldi there #one# #way# of settling this said $jacopo_manfredi$ do you go and i #will# stay and take #care# of the wounded #man#
and give up your share of the venture said $edmond_dantès$ to remain with me yes said $jacopo_manfredi$ and without any hesitation
you are a good #fellow# and a kind hearted messmate replied $edmond_dantès$ and heaven #will# recompense you for your generous intentions but i do not #wish# #anyone# to stay with me
a #day# or two of #rest# #will# set me up and i #hope# i shall find among the #rock# certain herbs most excellent for bruises
a peculiar #smile# passed over $m_dantès$ #lip# he squeezed $jacopo_manfredi$ #hand# warmly but #nothing# could shake his determination to remain and remain alone
the smugglers left with $edmond_dantès$ what he had requested and set sail but not without turning about several #time# and each #time# making #sign# of a cordial farewell to which $edmond_dantès$ replied with his #hand# only as if he could not move the #rest# of his #body#
then when they had disappeared he said with a #smile# tis strange that it should be among such #man# that we find #proof# of friendship and devotion
then he dragged himself cautiously to the top of a #rock# from which he had a full view of the #sea# and thence he saw the tartan complete her preparations for sailing weigh anchor and balancing herself as gracefully as a #water# fowl ere it takes to the wing set sail
at the #end# of an #hour# she was completely out of #sight# at least it was impossible for the wounded #man# to see her any longer from the #spot# where he was
then $m_dantès$ rose more agile and #light# than the kid among the myrtles and shrubs of these wild #rock# took his gun in #one# #hand# his pickaxe in the #other# and hastened towards the #rock# on which the marks he had noted terminated
and now he exclaimed remembering the tale of the arabian fisherman which $abbé_faria$ had related to him now open sesame
the sun had nearly reached the meridian and his scorching rays fell full on the #rock# which seemed themselves sensible of the heat
thousands of grasshoppers hidden in the bushes chirped with a monotonous and dull #note# the leaves of the myrtle and olive #tree# waved and rustled in the wind
at every #step# that $edmond_dantès$ took he disturbed the lizards glittering with the hues of the emerald afar off he saw the wild goats bounding from crag to crag
#chapter# the #secret# cave in a #word# the #island# was inhabited yet $edmond_dantès$ felt himself alone guided by the #hand# of god
he felt an indescribable sensation somewhat akin to dread that dread of the daylight which even in the desert makes us #fear# we are watched and observed
this #feeling# was so strong that at the #moment# when $edmond_dantès$ was about to begin his labor he stopped laid down his pickaxe seized his gun mounted to the summit of the highest #rock# and from thence gazed round in every direction
but it was not upon corsica the very #house# of which he could distinguish or on sardinia or on the #island# of $elba$ with its historical associations or upon the almost imperceptible #line# that to the experienced #eye# of a #sailor# alone revealed the coast of genoa the proud and leghorn the commercial that he gazed
it was at the brigantine that had left in the #morning# and the tartan that had just set sail that $edmond_dantès$ fixed his #eye#
the first was just disappearing in the straits of bonifacio the #other# following an opposite direction was about to round the #island# of corsica
he saw that he was on the highest #point# of the #island# a statue on this vast pedestal of granite #nothing# human appearing in #sight# while the blue ocean beat against the base of the #island# and covered it with a fringe of foam
then he descended with cautious and slow #step# for he dreaded lest an accident similar to that he had so adroitly feigned should happen in reality
$m_dantès$ as we have said had traced the marks along the #rock# and he had noticed that they led to a small creek which was hidden like the bath of some ancient nymph
this creek was sufficiently wide at its mouth and deep in the centre to admit of the entrance of a small #vessel# of the lugger class which would be perfectly concealed from observation
then following the clew that in the #hand# of the $abbé_faria$ had been so skilfully used to guide him through the dædalian labyrinth of probabilities he #thought# that the $cardinal_spada$ anxious not to be watched had entered the creek concealed his little barque followed the #line# marked by the notches in the #rock# and at the #end# of it had buried his #treasure#
this #sight# reassured him he then looked at the objects near him it was this #idea# that had brought $m_dantès$ back to the circular #rock#
#one# #thing# only perplexed $edmond_dantès$ and destroyed his theory how could this #rock# which weighed several tons have been lifted to this #spot# without the aid of many #man#
suddenly an #idea# flashed across his #mind# instead of raising it #thought# he they have lowered it and he sprang from the #rock# in #order# to inspect the base on which it had formerly stood
he soon perceived that a slope had been formed and the #rock# had slid along this until it stopped at the #spot# it now occupied
a large #stone# had served as a wedge flints and pebbles had been inserted around it so as to conceal the orifice this species of masonry had been covered with #earth# and grass and weeds had grown there moss had clung to the #stone# myrtle bushes had taken root and the old #rock# seemed fixed to the #earth#
$m_dantès$ dug away the #earth# carefully and detected or fancied he detected the ingenious artifice he attacked this #wall# cemented by the #hand# of #time# with his pickaxe
$m_dantès$ went and cut the strongest olive #tree# he could find stripped off its branches inserted it in the hole and used it as a lever
after ten #minute# labor the #wall# gave #way# and a hole large enough to insert the #arm# was opened but the #rock# was too heavy and too firmly wedged to be moved by #anyone# #man# were he hercules himself
$m_dantès$ saw that he must attack the wedge but how he cast his #eye# around and saw the horn full of powder which his #friend# $jacopo_manfredi$ had left him
with the aid of his pickaxe $m_dantès$ after the #manner# of a labor saving pioneer dug a mine between the upper #rock# and the #one# that supported it filled it with powder then made a match by rolling his handkerchief in saltpetre
the explosion soon followed the upper #rock# was lifted from its base by the terrific force of the powder the lower #one# flew into #piece# thousands of insects escaped from the aperture $m_dantès$ had previously formed and a huge snake like the guardian demon of the #treasure# rolled himself along in darkening coils and disappeared
he smiled the infernal invention would serve him for this #purpose# he lighted it and retired $m_dantès$ approached the upper #rock# which now without any support leaned towards the #sea#
the intrepid #treasure# seeker walked round it and selecting the #spot# from whence it appeared most susceptible to attack placed his lever in #one# of the crevices and strained every nerve to move the mass
$m_dantès$ redoubled his #effort# he seemed like #one# of the ancient titans who uprooted the mountains to hurl against the #father# of the gods
the #rock# already shaken by the explosion tottered on its base the #rock# yielded rolled over bounded from #point# to #point# and finally disappeared in the ocean
on the #spot# it had occupied was a circular space exposing an #iron# ring let into a square flag #stone# $m_dantès$ uttered a #cry# of #joy# and surprise never had a first attempt been crowned with more perfect success
he would fain have continued but his knees trembled and his #heart# beat so violently and his #sight# became so dim that he was forced to pause
$edmond_dantès$ inserted his lever in the ring and exerted all his #strength# the flag #stone# yielded and disclosed #step# that descended until they were lost in the obscurity of a subterraneous grotto
this #feeling# lasted but for a #moment# #anyone# else would have rushed on with a #cry# of #joy# $m_dantès$ turned pale hesitated and reflected
come said he to himself be a #man# i am accustomed to adversity i must not be cast down by the discovery that i have been deceived
what then would be the #use# of all i have suffered the #heart# breaks when after having been elated by flattering #hope# it sees all its illusions destroyed
$abbé_faria$ has dreamed this the $cardinal_spada$ buried no #treasure# here perhaps he never came here or if he did $cæsar_borgia$ the intrepid adventurer the stealthy and indefatigable plunderer has followed him discovered his traces pursued them as i have done raised the #stone# and descending before me has left me #nothing#
now that i expect #nothing# now that i no longer entertain the slightest #hope# the #end# of this adventure becomes simply a #matter# of curiosity
he remained motionless and pensive his #eye# fixed on the gloomy aperture that was open at his #foot#
and he remained again motionless and thoughtful yes yes this is an adventure worthy a #place# in the varied career of that royal #bandit#
yes $cæsar_borgia$ has been here a torch in #one# #hand# a sword in the #other# and within twenty paces at the #foot# of this #rock# perhaps two guards kept watch on land and #sea# while their #master# descended as i am about to descend dispelling the #darkness# before his awe inspiring progress
this fabulous #event# formed but a link in a long chain of marvels but what was the fate of the guards who thus possessed his #secret#
asked $m_dantès$ of himself the fate replied he smiling of those who buried alaric and were interred with the corpse
he would have found the #treasure# and $cæsar_borgia$ he who compared italy to an artichoke which he could devour leaf by leaf knew too well the value of #time# to waste it in replacing this #rock#
yet had he come #thought# $m_dantès$ i #will# go down then he descended a #smile# on his #lip# and murmuring that last #word# of human philosophy perhaps
but instead of the #darkness# and the thick and mephitic atmosphere he had expected to find $m_dantès$ saw a dim and bluish #light# which as well as the #air# entered not merely by the aperture he had just formed but by the interstices and crevices of the #rock# which were visible from without and through which he could distinguish the blue sky and the waving branches of the evergreen oaks and the tendrils of the creepers that grew from the #rock#
after having stood a few #minute# in the cavern the atmosphere of which was rather warm than damp $m_dantès$ #eye# habituated as it was to #darkness# could pierce even to the remotest angles of the cavern which was of granite that sparkled like #diamond#
alas said $edmond_dantès$ smiling these are the #treasure# the cardinal has left and the good #abbé# seeing in a #dream# these glittering #wall# has indulged in fallacious #hope#
but he called to #mind# the #word# of the #will# which he knew by #heart# in the farthest angle of the second #opening# said the cardinal #will#
he reflected that this second grotto must penetrate deeper into the #island# he examined the #stone# and sounded #one# #part# of the #wall# where he fancied the #opening# existed masked for precaution sake
he had only found the first grotto he had now to seek the second $m_dantès$ continued his search the pickaxe struck for a #moment# with a dull #sound# that drew out of $m_dantès$ #forehead# large drops of perspiration
at last it seemed to him that #one# #part# of the #wall# gave forth a more hollow and deeper echo he eagerly advanced and with the quickness of perception that no #one# but a #prisoner# possesses saw that there in all probability the #opening# must be
however he like $cæsar_borgia$ knew the value of #time# and in #order# to avoid fruitless toil he sounded all the #other# #wall# with his pickaxe struck the #earth# with the butt of his gun and finding #nothing# that appeared suspicious returned to that #part# of the #wall# whence issued the consoling #sound# he had before heard
as he struck the #wall# #piece# of stucco similar to that used in the #ground# #work# of arabesques broke off and fell to the #ground# in flakes exposing a large white #stone#
the aperture of the #rock# had been closed with #stone# then this stucco had been applied and painted to imitate granite
he again struck it and with greater force then a singular #thing# occurred $m_dantès$ struck with the sharp #end# of his pickaxe which entered someway between the interstices
but by some strange play of #emotion# in proportion as the #proof# that $abbé_faria$ had not been deceived became stronger so did his #heart# give #way# and a #feeling# of discouragement stole over him
this last #proof# instead of giving him fresh #strength# deprived him of it the pickaxe descended or rather fell he placed it on the #ground# passed his #hand# over his #brow# and remounted the stairs alleging to himself as an excuse a #desire# to be assured that no #one# was watching him but in reality because he felt that he was about to faint
the #island# was deserted and the sun seemed to cover it with its fiery #glance# afar off a few small fishing #boat# studded the bosom of the blue ocean
$m_dantès$ had tasted #nothing# but he #thought# not of hunger at such a #moment# he hastily swallowed a few drops of rum and again entered the cavern
the pickaxe that had seemed so heavy was now like a feather in his grasp he seized it and attacked the #wall#
after several blows he perceived that the #stone# were not cemented but had been merely placed #one# upon the #other# and covered with stucco he inserted the #point# of his pickaxe and using the handle as a lever with #joy# soon saw the #stone# #turn# as if on hinges and fall at his #foot#
he had #nothing# more to do now but with the #iron# tooth of the pickaxe to draw the #stone# towards him #one# by #one#
the aperture was already sufficiently large for him to enter but by waiting he could still cling to #hope# and retard the certainty of deception
the second grotto was lower and more gloomy than the first the #air# that could only enter by the newly formed #opening# had
it was there he must dig at last after renewed hesitation $m_dantès$ entered the second grotto the mephitic smell $m_dantès$ was surprised not to find in the outer cavern
he waited in #order# to allow pure #air# to displace the foul atmosphere and then went on at the left of the #opening# was a dark and deep angle
but to $m_dantès$ #eye# there was no #darkness# he glanced around this second grotto it was like the first empty the #treasure# if it existed was buried in this #corner#
the #time# had at #length# arrived two #foot# of #earth# removed and $m_dantès$ fate would be decided he advanced towards the angle and summoning all his resolution attacked the #ground# with the pickaxe
at the fifth or sixth blow the pickaxe struck against an #iron# substance never did funeral knell never did alarm bell produce a greater #effect# on the hearer
had $m_dantès$ found #nothing# he could not have become more ghastly pale he again struck his pickaxe into the #earth# and encountered the same resistance but not the same #sound#
at this #moment# a #shadow# passed rapidly before the #opening# $m_dantès$ seized his gun sprang through the #opening# and mounted the stair
it is a casket of wood bound with #iron# #thought# he a wild goat had passed before the mouth of the cave and was feeding at a little #distance#
this would have been a favorable occasion to secure his #dinner# but $m_dantès$ feared lest the report of his gun should attract #attention#
he #thought# a #moment# cut a branch of a resinous #tree# lighted it at the #fire# at which the smugglers had prepared their breakfast and descended with this torch
he approached the hole he had dug and now with the aid of the torch saw that his pickaxe had in reality struck against #iron# and wood
in an #instant# a space three #foot# long by two #foot# broad was cleared and $m_dantès$ could see an oaken coffer bound with cut steel in the middle of the lid he saw engraved on a silver plate which was still untarnished the #arm# of the $cardinal_spada$ #family# viz a sword en pale on an oval shield like all the italian armorial bearings and surmounted by a cardinal hat
he wished to see #everything# he planted his torch in the #ground# and resumed his labor $m_dantès$ easily recognized them $abbé_faria$ had so often drawn them for him
there was no longer any #doubt# the #treasure# was there no #one# would have been at such pains to conceal an empty casket
in an #instant# he had cleared every obstacle away and he saw successively the lock placed between two padlocks and the two handles at each #end# all carved as #thing# were carved at that epoch when art rendered the commonest metals precious
$m_dantès$ seized the handles and strove to lift the coffer it was impossible he sought to open it lock and padlock were fastened these faithful guardians seemed unwilling to surrender their trust
$m_dantès$ inserted the sharp #end# of the pickaxe between the coffer and the lid and pressing with all his force on the handle burst open the fastenings
the hinges yielded in their #turn# and fell still holding in their grasp fragments of the wood and the chest was open
he then closed his #eye# as #child# do in #order# that they may see in the resplendent #night# of their own imagination more stars than are visible in the firmament then he re opened them and stood motionless with amazement
$edmond_dantès$ was seized with vertigo he cocked his gun and laid it beside him three compartments divided the coffer
in the first blazed piles of golden coin in the second were ranged bars of unpolished #gold# which possessed #nothing# attractive save their value in the third $edmond_dantès$ grasped handfuls of #diamond# pearls and rubies which as they fell on #one# another sounded like hail against #glass#
after having touched felt examined these #treasure# $edmond_dantès$ rushed through the caverns like a #man# seized with frenzy he leaped on a #rock# from whence he could behold the #sea#
he was alone alone with these countless these unheard of #treasure# was he awake or was it but a #dream# was it a transient vision or was he #face# to #face# with reality
he would fain have gazed upon his #gold# and yet he had not #strength# enough for an #instant# he leaned his #head# in his #hand# as if to prevent his senses from leaving him and then rushed madly about the #rock# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ terrifying the wild goats and scaring the #sea# fowls with his wild #cry# and gestures then he returned and still unable to believe the evidence of his senses rushed into the grotto and found himself before this mine of #gold# and jewels
this #time# he fell on his knees and clasping his #hand# convulsively uttered a prayer intelligible to god alone he soon became calmer and more happy for only now did he begin to realize his felicity
there were a thousand ingots of #gold# each weighing from two to three pounds then he piled up twenty five thousand crowns each worth about eighty #franc# of our #money# and bearing the effigies of alexander vi and his predecessors and he saw that the complement was not #half# empty
and he measured ten double handfuls of pearls #diamond# and #other# gems many of which mounted by the most famous workmen were valuable beyond their intrinsic worth
$m_dantès$ saw the #light# gradually disappear and fearing to be surprised in the cavern left it his gun in his #hand#
a #piece# of biscuit and a small quantity of rum formed his supper and he snatched a few #hour# sleep lying over the mouth of the cave
it was a #night# of #joy# and #terror# such as this #man# of stupendous #emotion# had already experienced twice or thrice in his lifetime
he then set himself to #work# to #count# his #fortune# #chapter# the unknown #day# for which $m_dantès$ had so eagerly and impatiently waited with open #eye# again dawned
again he climbed the rocky height he had ascended the previous #evening# and strained his view to catch every peculiarity of the landscape but it wore the same wild barren aspect when seen by the rays of the #morning# sun which it had done when surveyed by the fading glimmer of eve
descending into the grotto he lifted the #stone# filled his #pocket# with gems put the #box# together as well and securely as he could sprinkled fresh sand over the #spot# from which it had been taken and then carefully trod down the #earth# to give it everywhere a uniform #appearance# then quitting the grotto he replaced the #stone# heaping on it broken masses of #rock# and rough fragments of crumbling granite filling the interstices with #earth# into which he deftly inserted rapidly growing plants such as the wild myrtle and flowering thorn then carefully watering these new plantations he scrupulously effaced every trace of footsteps leaving the approach to the cavern as savage looking and untrodden as he had found it
to wait at $m_de_monte_cristo$ for the #purpose# of watching like a dragon over the almost incalculable riches that had thus fallen into his #possession# satisfied not the cravings of his #heart# which yearned to #return# to dwell among mankind and to assume the rank #power# and influence which are always accorded to wealth that first and greatest of all the forces within the grasp of #man#
with the first #light# $m_dantès$ resumed his search this done he impatiently awaited the #return# of his #companion# on the sixth #day# the smugglers returned
from a #distance# $m_dantès$ recognized the rig and handling of $la_jeune_amélie$ and dragging himself with affected difficulty towards the landing #place# he met his #companion# with an assurance that although considerably better than when they quitted him he still suffered acutely from his late accident
to this #question# the smugglers replied that although successful in landing their cargo in safety they had scarcely done so when they received intelligence that a guard ship had just quitted the port of toulon and was crowding all sail towards them
this obliged them to make all the speed they could to evade the #enemy# when they could but lament the absence of $m_dantès$ whose superior skill in the management of a #vessel# would have availed them so materially
in #fact# the pursuing #vessel# had almost overtaken them when fortunately #night# came on and enabled them to double the cape of corsica and so elude all further pursuit
upon the whole however the trip had been sufficiently successful to satisfy all concerned while the crew and particularly $jacopo_manfredi$ expressed great regrets that $m_dantès$ had not been an equal sharer with themselves in the profits which amounted to no less a #sum# than fifty piastres each
m $edmond_dantès$ preserved the most admirable self command not suffering the faintest indication of a #smile# to escape him at the enumeration of all the benefits he would have reaped had he been able to quit the #island# but as $la_jeune_amélie$ had merely come to $m_de_monte_cristo$ to fetch him away he embarked that same #evening# and proceeded with the #captain# to leghorn
arrived at leghorn he repaired to the $house_of_peers$ of a jew a dealer in precious #stone# to whom he disposed of four of his smallest #diamond# for five thousand #franc# each
$m_dantès$ #half# feared that such valuable jewels in the #hand# of a poor #sailor# like himself might excite suspicion but the cunning purchaser asked no troublesome #question# concerning a bargain by which he gained a round profit of at least eighty per cent
the following #day# $m_dantès$ presented $jacopo_manfredi$ with an entirely new #vessel# accompanying the gift by a donation of #one# hundred piastres that he might provide himself with a suitable crew and #other# requisites for his outfit upon condition that he would go at once to marseilles for the #purpose# of inquiring after an old #man# named $louis_xviii$ $m_dantès$ residing in the allées de meilhan and also a young #woman# called $mercédès$ an inhabitant of the catalan village
$jacopo_manfredi$ could scarcely believe his senses at receiving this magnificent present which $m_dantès$ hastened to #account# for by saying that he had merely been a #sailor# from whim and a #desire# to #spite# his #family# who did not allow him as much #money# as he liked to spend but that on his arrival at leghorn he had come into #possession# of a large #fortune# left him by an uncle whose sole heir he was
the superior education of $m_dantès$ gave an #air# of such extreme probability to this statement that it never once occurred to $jacopo_manfredi$ to #doubt# its accuracy
the term for which $edmond_dantès$ had engaged to serve on #board# $la_jeune_amélie$ having expired $m_dantès$ took leave of the #captain# who at first tried all his #power# of persuasion to induce him to remain as #one# of the crew but having been told the history of the legacy he ceased to importune him further
the following #morning# $jacopo_manfredi$ set sail for marseilles with directions from $m_dantès$ to join him at the #island# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
having seen $jacopo_manfredi$ fairly out of the harbor $m_dantès$ proceeded to make his final adieus on #board# $la_jeune_amélie$ distributing so liberal a gratuity among her crew as to secure for him the good #wish# of all and #expression# of cordial #interest# in all that concerned him
he then inquired how they had fared in their trip to the #captain# he promised to write when he had made up his #mind# as to his future #plan#
at the #moment# of his arrival a small yacht was under trial in the bay this yacht had been built by #order# of an englishman who having heard that the genoese excelled all #other# builders along the shores of the mediterranean in the construction of fast sailing #vessel# was desirous of possessing a specimen of their skill the price agreed upon between the englishman and the genoese builder was forty thousand #franc#
$m_dantès$ struck with the beauty and capability of the little #vessel# applied to its owner to transfer it to him offering sixty thousand #franc# upon condition that he should be allowed to take immediate #possession#
the proposal was too advantageous to be refused the more so as the #person# for whom the yacht was intended had gone upon a tour through switzerland and was not expected back in less than three weeks or a #month# by which #time# the builder reckoned upon being able to complete another
$m_dantès$ led the owner of the yacht to the dwelling of a jew retired with the latter for a few #minute# to a small back parlor and upon their #return# the jew counted out to the shipbuilder the #sum# of sixty thousand #franc# in bright #gold# #piece#
the delighted builder then offered his #service# in providing a suitable crew for the little #vessel# but this $m_dantès$ declined with many #thank# saying he was accustomed to cruise about quite alone and his principal #pleasure# consisted in managing his yacht himself the only #thing# the builder could oblige him in would be to contrive a #sort# of #secret# closet in the cabin at his #bed# #head# the closet to contain three divisions so constructed as to be concealed from all but himself
the builder cheerfully undertook the commission and promised to have these #secret# #place# completed by the next #day# $m_dantès$ furnishing the dimensions and #plan# in accordance with which they were to be constructed
two #hour# afterward $m_dantès$ sailed from the port of genoa under the inspection of an immense crowd drawn together by curiosity to see the rich spanish nobleman who preferred managing his own yacht
then $m_dantès$ departed for genoa a bargain was therefore struck but their wonder was soon changed to admiration at seeing the perfect skill with which $m_dantès$ handled the helm
the #boat# indeed seemed to be animated with almost human intelligence so promptly did it obey the slightest touch and $m_dantès$ required but a short trial of his beautiful craft to acknowledge that the genoese had not without #reason# attained their high reputation in the art of shipbuilding
the spectators followed the little #vessel# with their #eye# as long as it remained visible they then turned their conjectures upon her probable destination
some insisted she was making for corsica #other# the #island# of $elba$ bets were offered to any amount that she was bound for spain while africa was positively reported by many #person# as her intended #course# but no #one# #thought# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
yet thither it was that $m_dantès$ guided his #vessel# and at $m_de_monte_cristo$ he arrived at the close of the second #day# his #boat# had proved herself a first class #sailor# and had come the #distance# from genoa in thirty five #hour#
$m_dantès$ had carefully noted the general #appearance# of the shore and instead of landing at the usual #place# he dropped anchor in the little creek
the #island# was utterly deserted and bore no evidence of having been visited since he went away his #treasure# was just as he had left it
early on the following #morning# he commenced the removal of his riches and ere nightfall the whole of his immense wealth was safely deposited in the compartments of the #secret# locker
$m_dantès$ employed it in manœuvring his yacht round the #island# studying it as a skilful horseman would the animal he destined for some important #service# till at the #end# of that #time# he was perfectly conversant with its good and bad qualities
a week passed by the former $m_dantès$ proposed to augment the latter to remedy upon the eighth #day# he discerned a small #vessel# under full sail approaching $m_de_monte_cristo$
as it drew near he recognized it as the #boat# he had given to $jacopo_manfredi$ he immediately signalled it his signal was returned and in two #hour# afterwards the new comer lay at anchor beside the yacht
a mournful #answer# awaited each of $edmond_dantès$ eager inquiries as to the information $jacopo_manfredi$ had obtained old $m_dantès$ was dead and $mercédès$ had disappeared
$m_dantès$ listened to these melancholy tidings with outward calmness but leaping lightly ashore he signified his #desire# to be quite alone
two of the #man# from $jacopo_manfredi$ #boat# came on #board# the yacht to assist in navigating it and he gave #order# that she should be steered direct to marseilles
for his #father# #death# he was in some #manner# prepared but he knew not how to #account# for the mysterious disappearance of $mercédès$
in a couple of #hour# he returned without divulging his #secret# $m_dantès$ could not give sufficiently clear instructions to an agent
there were besides #other# particulars he was desirous of ascertaining and those were of a #nature# he alone could investigate in a #manner# satisfactory to himself
his looking #glass# had assured him during his stay at leghorn that he ran no risk of recognition moreover he had now the #mean# of adopting any disguise he #thought# proper
#one# fine #morning# then his yacht followed by the little fishing #boat# boldly entered the port of marseilles and anchored exactly opposite the #spot# from whence on the never to be forgotten #night# of his departure for the château if he had been put on #board# the #boat# destined to convey him thither
still $m_dantès$ could not view without a shudder the approach of a gendarme who accompanied the #officer# deputed to demand his bill of health ere the yacht was permitted to hold communication with the shore but with that perfect self #possession# he had acquired during his acquaintance with $abbé_faria$ $m_dantès$ coolly presented an english passport he had obtained from leghorn and as this gave him a standing which a french passport would not have afforded he was informed that there existed no obstacle to his immediate debarkation
the first #person# to attract the #attention# of $m_dantès$ as he landed on the canebière was #one# of the crew belonging to the $pharaon$
$edmond_dantès$ welcomed the meeting with this #fellow# who had been #one# of his own #sailor# as a sure #mean# of testing the extent of the change which #time# had worked in his own #appearance#
#countenance# as he did so but not a #word# or #look# implied that he had the slightest #idea# of ever having seen before the #person# with whom he was then conversing
giving the #sailor# a #piece# of #money# in #return# for his civility $m_dantès$ proceeded onwards but ere he had gone many #step# he heard the #man# loudly calling him to stop
going straight towards him he propounded a variety of #question# on different #subject# carefully watching the #man# $m_dantès$ instantly turned to meet him
but i believe you made a mistake you intended to give me a two #franc# #piece# and see you gave me a double $napoleon$
i beg your pardon #sir# said the honest #fellow# in almost breathless haste #thank# you my good #friend#
i see that i have made a trifling mistake as you say but by #way# of rewarding your honesty i give you another double $napoleon$ that you may drink to my health and be able to ask your messmates to join you
so extreme was the surprise of the #sailor# that he was unable even to #thank# $edmond_dantès$ whose receding figure he continued to gaze after in speechless #astonishment#
each #step# he trod oppressed his #heart# with fresh #emotion# his first and most indelible recollections were there not a #tree# not a #street# that he passed but seemed filled with dear and cherished memories
and thus he proceeded onwards till he arrived at the #end# of the rue de noailles from whence a full view of the allées de meilhan was obtained
at this #spot# so pregnant with fond and filial remembrances his #heart# beat almost to bursting his knees tottered under him a mist floated over his #sight# and had he not clung for support to #one# of the #tree# he would inevitably have fallen to the #ground# and been crushed beneath the many vehicles continually passing there
recovering himself however he wiped the perspiration from his #brow# and stopped not again till he found himself at the #door# of the $house_of_peers$ in which his #father# had lived
the nasturtiums and #other# plants which his #father# had delighted to train before his #window# had all disappeared from the upper #part# of the $house_of_peers$
some nabob from india was his comment $m_dantès$ meanwhile went on his #way# leaning against the #tree# he gazed thoughtfully for a #time# at the upper #story# of the shabby little $house_of_peers$
though answered in the negative he begged so earnestly to be permitted to #visit# those on the fifth #floor# that in despite of the oft repeated assurance of the concierge that they were occupied $m_dantès$ succeeded in inducing the #man# to go up to the tenants and ask permission for a #gentleman# to be allowed to #look# at them
the tenants of the humble lodging were a young couple who had been scarcely married a week and seeing them $m_dantès$ sighed heavily
#nothing# in the two small #chamber# forming the #apartment# remained as it had been in the #time# of the elder $m_dantès$ the very #paper# was different while the articles of antiquated furniture with which the #room# had been filled in $edmond_dantès$ #time# had all disappeared the four #wall# alone remained as he had left them
the #bed# belonging to the present occupants was placed as the former owner of the #chamber# had been accustomed to have his and in #spite# of his #effort# to prevent it the #eye# of $edmond_dantès$ were suffused in #tear# as he reflected that on that #spot# the old #man# had breathed his last vainly calling for his #son#
the young couple gazed with #astonishment# at the #sight# of their visitor #emotion# and wondered to see the large #tear# silently chasing each #other# down his otherwise stern and immovable #feature# but they felt the sacredness of his #grief# and kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause while with instinctive delicacy they left him to indulge his sorrow alone
when he withdrew from the #scene# of his painful recollections they both accompanied him downstairs reiterating their #hope# that he would come again whenever he pleased and assuring him that their poor dwelling would ever be open to him
as $edmond_dantès$ passed the #door# on the fourth #floor# he paused to inquire whether $m_caderousse$ the tailor still dwelt there but he received for reply that the #person# in #question# had got into difficulties and at the present #time# kept a small inn on the route from bellegarde to beaucaire
having obtained the address of the #person# to whom the $house_of_peers$ in the allées de meilhan belonged $m_dantès$ next proceeded thither and under the #name# of $lord_wilmore$ the #name# and title inscribed on his passport purchased the small dwelling for the #sum# of twenty five thousand #franc# at least ten thousand more than it was worth but had its owner asked #half# a #million# it would unhesitatingly have been given
the very same #day# the occupants of the #apartment# on the fifth #floor# of the $house_of_peers$ now become the property of $m_dantès$ were duly informed by the #notary# who had arranged the necessary transfer of deeds etc that the new landlord gave them their choice of any of the #room# in the $house_of_peers$ without the least augmentation of rent upon condition of their giving #instant# #possession# of the two small #chamber# they at present inhabited
this strange #event# aroused great wonder and curiosity in the neighborhood of the allées de meilhan and a multitude of theories were afloat none of which was anywhere near the #truth#
but what raised public #astonishment# to a climax and set all conjecture at defiance was the knowledge that the same #stranger# who had in the #morning# visited the allées de meilhan had been seen in the #evening# walking in the little village of the catalans and afterwards observed to enter a poor fisherman hut and to pass more than an #hour# in inquiring after #person# who had either been dead or gone away for more than fifteen or sixteen #year#
but on the following #day# the #family# from whom all these particulars had been asked received a handsome present consisting of an entirely new fishing #boat# with two seines and a tender
the delighted recipients of these munificent gifts would gladly have poured out their #thank# to their generous benefactor but they had seen him upon quitting the hut merely give some #order# to a #sailor# and then springing lightly on horseback leave marseilles by the porte aix
then he advanced to the #door# and asked whether there were any #room# to be let #chapter# the pont du gard inn
such of my readers as have made a pedestrian excursion to the south of france may perchance have noticed about midway between the town of beaucaire and the village of bellegarde a little nearer to the former than to the latter a small roadside inn from the front of which hung creaking and flapping in the wind a sheet of tin covered with a grotesque representation of the pont du gard
it also boasted of what in languedoc is styled a #garden# consisting of a small plot of #ground# on the #side# opposite to the main entrance reserved for the reception of #guest#
a few dingy olives and stunted fig #tree# struggled hard for existence but their withered dusty foliage abundantly proved how unequal was the conflict
between these sickly shrubs grew a scanty supply of garlic tomatoes and eschalots while lone and solitary like a forgotten sentinel a tall pine raised its melancholy #head# in #one# of the #corner# of this unattractive #spot# and displayed its flexible stem and fan shaped summit dried and cracked by the fierce heat of the sub tropical sun
all these #tree# great or small were turned in the direction to which the mistral blows #one# of the three curses of provence the #other# being the durance and the parliament
in the surrounding plain which more resembled a dusty lake than solid #ground# were scattered a few miserable stalks of wheat the #effect# no #doubt# of a curious #desire# on the #part# of the agriculturists of the #country# to see whether such a #thing# as the raising of grain in those parched regions was practicable
each stalk served as a perch for a grasshopper which regaled the passers by through this egyptian #scene# with its strident monotonous #note#
for about seven or eight #year# the little tavern had been kept by a #man# and his #wife# with two #servant# a chambermaid named trinette and a hostler called pecaud
this small staff was quite equal to all the requirements for a canal between beaucaire and aiguemortes had revolutionized transportation by substituting #boat# for the cart and the stagecoach
and as though to add to the daily misery which this prosperous canal inflicted on the unfortunate innkeeper whose utter ruin it was fast accomplishing it was situated between the rhône from which it had its source and the post #road# it had depleted not a hundred #step# from the inn of which we have given a brief but faithful description
the innkeeper himself was a #man# of from forty to fifty five #year# of #age# tall strong and bony a perfect specimen of the natives of those southern latitudes he had dark sparkling and deep set #eye# hooked nose and teeth white as those of a carnivorous animal his #hair# like his beard which he wore under his chin was thick and curly and in #spite# of his #age# but slightly interspersed with a few silvery threads
his naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown from the habit the unfortunate #man# had acquired of stationing himself from #morning# till eve at the threshold of his #door# on the lookout for #guest# who seldom came yet there he stood #day# after #day# exposed to the meridional rays of a burning sun with no #other# protection for his #head# than a red handkerchief twisted around it after the #manner# of the spanish muleteers
this modern #place# of entertainment stood on the left #hand# #side# of the post #road# and backed upon the rhône this #man# was our old acquaintance $gaspard_caderousse$ $m_caderousse$
born in the neighborhood of arles she had shared in the beauty for which its #woman# are proverbial but that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of aiguemortes and the marshes of camargue
she remained nearly always in her second #floor# #chamber# shivering in her #chair# or stretched languid and feeble on her #bed# while her #husband# kept his daily watch at the #door# a #duty# he performed with so much the greater willingness as it saved him the necessity of listening to the endless plaints and murmurs of his helpmate who never saw him without breaking out into bitter invectives against fate to all of which her #husband# would calmly #return# an unvarying reply in these philosophic #word#
his #wife# on the #contrary# whose maiden #name# had been madeleine radelle was pale meagre and sickly looking hush $la_carconte$
the sobriquet of $la_carconte$ had been bestowed on madeleine radelle from the #fact# that she had been born in a village so called situated between salon and lambesc and as a custom existed among the inhabitants of that #part# of france where $m_caderousse$ lived of styling every #person# by some particular and distinctive appellation her #husband# had bestowed on her the #name# of $la_carconte$ in #place# of her sweet and euphonious #name# of madeleine which in all probability his rude gutteral language would not have enabled him to pronounce
still let it not be supposed that amid this affected resignation to the #will# of providence the unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing the hateful canal carry off his customers and his profits and the daily infliction of his peevish partner
like #other# dwellers in the south he was a #man# of sober habits and moderate #desire# but fond of external show vain and addicted to display
it is god #pleasure# that #thing# should be so murmurs and lamentations during the #day# of his prosperity not a festivity took #place# without himself and #wife# being among the spectators
he dressed in the picturesque #costume# worn upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the south of france bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by the catalans and andalusians while $la_carconte$ displayed the charming fashion prevalent among the #woman# of arles a mode of attire borrowed equally from greece and arabia
but by degrees watch chains necklaces parti colored scarves embroidered bodices velvet vests elegantly worked stockings striped gaiters and silver buckles for the shoes all disappeared and $gaspard_caderousse$ $m_caderousse$ unable to appear abroad in his pristine splendor had given up any further participation in the pomps and vanities both for himself and #wife# although a bitter #feeling# of envious discontent filled his #mind# as the #sound# of mirth and merry music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to which he still clung more for the shelter than the profit it afforded
$m_caderousse$ then was as usual at his #place# of observation before the #door# his #eye# glancing listlessly from a #piece# of closely shaven grass on which some fowls were industriously though fruitlessly endeavoring to #turn# up some grain or insect suited to their palate to the deserted #road# which led away to the north and south when he was aroused by the shrill #voice# of his #wife# and grumbling to himself as he went he mounted to her #chamber# first taking #care# however to set the entrance #door# wide open as an invitation to any #chance# #traveller# who might be passing
at the #moment# $m_caderousse$ quitted his sentry like watch before the #door# the #road# on which he so eagerly strained his #sight# was void and lonely as a desert at midday
there it lay stretching out into #one# interminable #line# of dust and sand with its #side# bordered by tall meagre #tree# altogether presenting so uninviting an #appearance# that no #one# in his senses could have imagined that any #traveller# at #liberty# to regulate his #hour# for journeying would choose to expose himself in such a formidable sahara
nevertheless had $m_caderousse$ but retained his post a few #minute# longer he might have caught a dim outline of #something# approaching from the direction of bellegarde as the moving object drew nearer he would easily have perceived that it consisted of a #man# and #horse# between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared to exist
his rider was a #priest# dressed in black and wearing a three cornered hat and #spite# of the ardent rays of a noonday sun the pair came on with a fair degree of rapidity
having arrived before the pont du gard the #horse# stopped but whether for his own #pleasure# or that of his rider would have been difficult to say
however that might have been the #priest# dismounting led his steed by the bridle in search of some #place# to which he could secure him
availing himself of a handle that projected from a #half# fallen #door# he tied the animal safely and having drawn a red cotton handkerchief from his #pocket# wiped away the perspiration that streamed from his #brow# then advancing to the #door# struck thrice with the #end# of his #iron# shod stick
at this unusual #sound# a huge black dog came rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to society
at that #moment# a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden #staircase# that led from the upper #floor# and with many bows and courteous #smile# the host of the pont du gard besought his #guest# to enter
the #horse# was of hungarian breed and ambled along at an easy pace you are welcome #sir# most welcome
repeated the astonished $m_caderousse$ now then margotin cried he speaking to the dog #will# you be quiet pray dont heed him
#sir# he only barks he never bites i make no #doubt# a #glass# of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully hot #day#
then perceiving for the first #time# the garb of the #traveller# he had to entertain $m_caderousse$ hastily exclaimed a thousand pardons
i really did not observe whom i had the #honor# to receive under my poor roof what would the #abbé# please to have
what refreshment can i offer all i have is at his #service# the #priest# gazed on the #person# addressing him with a long and searching gaze
there even seemed a disposition on his #part# to #court# a similar scrutiny on the #part# of the innkeeper then observing in the #countenance# of the latter no #other# #expression# than extreme surprise at his own want of #attention# to an inquiry so courteously worded he deemed it as well to terminate this dumb show and therefore said speaking with a strong italian accent
yes #sir# answered the host even more surprised at the #question# than he had been by the #silence# which had preceded it
you are i presume $m_caderousse$ i am $gaspard_caderousse$ $m_caderousse$ at your #service# $gaspard_caderousse$ $m_caderousse$ rejoined the #priest#
yes christian and surname are the same you formerly lived i believe in the allées de meilhan on the fourth #floor#
i did and you followed the #business# of a tailor true i was a tailor till the trade fell off
it is so hot at marseilles that really i believe that the respectable inhabitants #will# in #time# go without any clothing whatever
yes let me have a bottle of your best wine and then with your permission we #will# resume our #conversation# from where we left off
as you please #sir# said $m_caderousse$ who anxious not to lose the present opportunity of finding a customer for #one# of the few bottles of cahors still remaining in his #possession# hastily raised a trap #door# in the #floor# of the #apartment# they were in which served both as parlor and kitchen
upon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the expiration of five #minute# he found the #abbé# seated upon a wooden stool leaning his elbow on a #table# while margotin whose animosity seemed appeased by the unusual command of the #traveller# for refreshments had crept up to him and had established himself very comfortably between his knees his long skinny neck resting on his lap while his dim #eye# was fixed earnestly on the #traveller# #face#
but talking of heat is there #nothing# i can offer you by #way# of refreshment are you quite alone inquired the #guest# as $m_caderousse$ placed before him the bottle of wine and a #glass#
quite quite alone replied the #man# or at least practically so for my poor #wife# who is the only #person# in the $house_of_peers$ besides myself is laid up with illness and unable to render me the least assistance poor #thing#
you are married then said the #priest# with a show of #interest# glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the #apartment#
ah #sir# said $m_caderousse$ with a sigh it is easy to perceive i am not a rich #man# but in this #world# a #man# does not thrive the better for being honest
yes honest i can certainly say that much for myself continued the innkeeper fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the #abbé# gaze i can boast with #truth# of being an honest #man# and continued he significantly with a #hand# on his breast and shaking his #head# that is more than #everyone# can say nowadays
so much the better for you if what you assert be true said the #abbé# for i am firmly persuaded that sooner or later the good #will# be rewarded and the wicked punished
such #word# as those belong to your profession answered $m_caderousse$ and you do well to repeat them but added he with a bitter #expression# of #countenance# #one# is free to believe them or not as #one# pleases
the #abbé# fixed on him a searching penetrating #glance# you are wrong to speak thus said the #abbé#
and perhaps i may in my own #person# be able to prove to you how completely you are in error
what #mean# you inquired $m_caderousse$ with a #look# of surprise in the first #place# i must be satisfied that you are the #person# i am in search of
what #proof# do you require did you in the #year# or know #anything# of a young #sailor# named $m_dantès$
exclaimed $m_caderousse$ whose #countenance# flushed darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the #abbé# fixed on him while the clear calm #eye# of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish scrutiny
you remind me said the #priest# that the young #man# concerning whom i asked you was said to bear the #name# of $edmond_dantès$
$m_dantès$ did i know poor dear $edmond_dantès$ why $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ and myself were intimate #friend# said to bear the #name#
why he was so called as truly as i myself bore the appellation of $gaspard_caderousse$ $m_caderousse$ but tell me i pray what has become of poor $edmond_dantès$
repeated $m_caderousse$ becoming excited and eager did you know him is he alive and at #liberty# is he prosperous and happy
he died a more wretched hopeless #heart# broken #prisoner# than the felons who pay the penalty of their #crime# at the galleys of toulon
a deadly pallor followed the flush on the #countenance# of $m_caderousse$ who turned away and the #priest# saw him wiping the #tear# from his #eye# with the #corner# of the red handkerchief twisted round his #head#
well there #sir# is another #proof# that good #people# are never rewarded on this #earth# and that none but the wicked prosper
poor #fellow# poor #fellow# murmured $m_caderousse$ ah continued $m_caderousse$ speaking in the highly colored language of the south the #world# grows worse and worse
why does not god if he really hates the wicked as he is said to do send down brimstone and #fire# and consume them altogether
you speak as though you had loved this young $m_dantès$ observed the #abbé# without taking any notice of his #companion#
vehemence and so i did replied $m_caderousse$ though once i confess i envied him his good #fortune# but i swear to you #sir# i swear to you by #everything# a #man# holds dear
there was a brief #silence# during which the fixed searching #eye# of the #abbé# was employed in scrutinizing the agitated #feature# of the innkeeper
i have since then deeply and sincerely lamented his unhappy fate you knew the poor lad then continued $m_caderousse$
i was called to see him on his dying #bed# that i might administer to him the consolations of religion
of what think you do young and strong #man# die in #prison# when they have scarcely numbered their thirtieth #year# unless it be of imprisonment
and of what did he die asked $m_caderousse$ in a choking #voice# $m_caderousse$ wiped away the large beads of perspiration that gathered on his #brow#
but the strangest #part# of the #story# is resumed the #abbé# that $m_dantès$ even in his dying #moment# swore by his crucified redeemer that he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention
and so he was murmured $m_caderousse$ how should he have been otherwise ah #sir# the poor #fellow# told you the #truth#
and for that #reason# he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he had never been able to penetrate and to clear his memory should
and here the #look# of the #abbé# becoming more and more fixed seemed to #rest# with ill concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was rapidly spreading over the #countenance# of $m_caderousse$
a rich englishman continued the #abbé# who had been his #companion# in #misfortune# but had been released from #prison# during the second restoration was possessed of a #diamond# of immense value
this jewel he bestowed on $m_dantès$ upon himself quitting the #prison# as a mark of his gratitude for the kindness and brotherly #care# with which $m_dantès$ had nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement
instead of employing this #diamond# in attempting to bribe his #jailer# who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the #governor# $m_dantès$ carefully preserved it that in the #event# of his getting out of #prison# he might have wherewithal to live for the sale of such a #diamond# would have quite sufficed to make his #fortune#
any foul #spot# or stain have fallen on it then i suppose asked $m_caderousse$ with eager glowing #look# that it was a #stone# of immense value
why #everything# is relative answered the #abbé# to #one# in $edmond_dantès$ #position# the #diamond# certainly was of great value
it was estimated at fifty thousand #franc# bless me exclaimed $m_caderousse$ fifty thousand #franc# surely the #diamond# was as large as a nut to be worth all that
no replied the #abbé# it was not of such a size as that but you shall judge for yourself
the sharp gaze of $m_caderousse$ was instantly directed towards the #priest# garments as though hoping to discover the location of the #treasure#
calmly #drawing# forth from his #pocket# a small #box# covered with black shagreen the #abbé# opened it and displayed to the dazzled #eye# of $m_caderousse$ the sparkling jewel it contained set in a ring of admirable workmanship
i have it with me and that #diamond# cried $m_caderousse$ almost breathless with eager admiration you say is worth fifty thousand #franc#
it is without the setting which is also valuable replied the #abbé# as he closed the #box# and returned it to his #pocket# while its brilliant hues seemed still to dance before the #eye# of the fascinated innkeeper
but how comes the #diamond# in your #possession# #sir# did $edmond_dantès$ make you his heir no merely his testamentary executor
i once possessed four dear and faithful #friend# besides the maiden to whom i was betrothed he said and i feel convinced they have all unfeignedly grieved over my loss
the #name# of #one# of the four #friend# is $m_caderousse$ the innkeeper shivered another of the number continued the #abbé# without seeming to notice the #emotion# of $m_caderousse$
is called $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and the third in #spite# of being my rival entertained a very sincere affection for me
a fiendish #smile# played over the #feature# of $m_caderousse$ who was about to break in upon the #abbé# speech when the latter waving his #hand# said allow me to finish first and then if you have any observations to make you can do so afterwards
the third of my #friend# although my rival was much attached to me his #name# was $m_fernand_mondego$ that of my betrothed was stay stay continued the #abbé#
i have forgotten what he called her $mercédès$ said $m_caderousse$ eagerly true said the #abbé# with a stifled sigh
$m_caderousse$ quickly performed the #stranger# bidding and after pouring some into a #glass# and slowly swallowing its contents the #abbé# resuming his usual placidity of #manner# said as he placed his empty #glass# on the #table# where did we leave off
$mercédès$ it was go on urged $m_caderousse$ bring me a carafe of #water# said the #abbé# the #name# of $edmond_dantès$ betrothed was $mercédès$
to be sure you #will# go to marseilles said $m_dantès$ for you understand i repeat his #word# just as he uttered them
you #will# sell this #diamond# you #will# divide the #money# into five equal #part# and give an equal portion to these good #friend# the only #person# who have loved me upon #earth#
do you understand perfectly but why into five #part# asked $m_caderousse$ you only mentioned four #person#
because the fifth is dead as i hear the fifth sharer in $edmond_dantès$ bequest was his own #father#
too true too true ejaculated $m_caderousse$ almost suffocated by the contending passions which assailed him the poor old #man# did die
but from the #length# of #time# that has elapsed since the #death# of the elder $m_dantès$ i was unable to obtain any particulars of his #end#
i learned so much at marseilles replied the #abbé# making a strong #effort# to appear indifferent can you enlighten me on that #point#
i do not know who could if i could not said $m_caderousse$ why i lived almost on the same #floor# with the poor old #man#
ah yes about a #year# after the disappearance of his #son# the poor old #man# died of what did he die
enteritis i believe his acquaintances say he died of #grief# but i who saw him in his dying #moment# i say he died of $m_caderousse$ paused
why the #doctor# called his complaint gastro of what asked the #priest# anxiously and eagerly why of downright starvation
starvation exclaimed the #abbé# springing from his #seat# why the vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a #death# as that
the very dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the #street# find some pitying #hand# to cast them a mouthful of bread and that a #man# a christian should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of #other# #man# who call themselves christians is too horrible for belief
oh it is impossible utterly impossible what i have said i have said answered $m_caderousse$ and you are a fool for having said #anything# about it said a #voice# from the top of the stairs
the two #man# turned quickly and saw the sickly #countenance# of $la_carconte$ peering between the baluster rails attracted by the #sound# of #voice# she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs and seated on the lower #step# #head# on knees she had listened to the foregoing #conversation#
why should you meddle with what does not concern you #mind# your own #business# #wife# replied $m_caderousse$ sharply
this #gentleman# asks me for information which common politeness #will# not permit me to refuse politeness you simpleton retorted $la_carconte$
what have you to do with politeness i should like to know better #study# a little common prudence how do you know the motives that #person# may have for trying to extract all he can from you
i pledge you my #word# madam said the #abbé# that my intentions are good and that your #husband# can incur no risk provided he #answer# me candidly
#nothing# is easier than to begin with fair #promise# and assurances of #nothing# to #fear# but when poor silly folks like my #husband# there have been persuaded to tell all they know the #promise# and assurances of safety are quickly forgotten and at some #moment# when nobody is expecting it behold trouble and misery and all #sort# of persecutions are heaped on the unfortunate wretches who cannot even see whence all their afflictions come
ah that all very fine retorted the #woman# nay nay my good #woman# make yourself perfectly easy i beg of you
$la_carconte$ muttered a few inarticulate #word# then let her #head# again drop upon her knees and went into a fit of ague leaving the two speakers to resume the #conversation# but remaining so as to be able to hear every #word# they uttered
again the #abbé# had been obliged to swallow a draught of #water# to calm the #emotion# that threatened to overpower him
whatever evils may befall you they #will# not be occasioned by my instrumentality that i solemnly #promise# you when he had sufficiently recovered himself he said
it appears then that the miserable old #man# you were telling me of was forsaken by #everyone# surely had not such been the #case# he would not have perished by so dreadful a #death#
were very kind to him but somehow the poor old #man# had contracted a profound hatred for $m_fernand_mondego$ the very #person# added $m_caderousse$ with a bitter #smile# that you named just now as being #one# of $m_dantès$ faithful and attached #friend#
why he was not altogether forsaken continued $m_caderousse$ for $mercédès$ the catalan and $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ and was he not so
asked the #abbé# $gaspard_caderousse$ gaspard murmured the #woman# from her #seat# on the stairs #mind# what you are saying
$m_caderousse$ made no reply to these #word# though evidently irritated and annoyed by the interruption but addressing the #abbé# said can a #man# be faithful to another whose #wife# he covets and #desire# for himself
poor $edmond_dantès$ he was cruelly deceived but it was fortunate that he never knew or he might have found it more difficult when on his deathbed to pardon his #enemy#
and whatever #people# may say continued $m_caderousse$ in his native language which was not altogether devoid of rude poetry i cannot help being more frightened at the #idea# of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living
but $m_dantès$ was so honorable and true in his own #nature# that he believed everybody professions of friendship imbecile
exclaimed $la_carconte$ do you then know in what #manner# $m_fernand_mondego$ injured $m_dantès$ inquired the #abbé# of $m_caderousse$
do i no #one# better speak out then say what it was $gaspard_caderousse$ cried $la_carconte$ do as you #will# you are #master#
but if you take my advice you ll hold your tongue well #wife# replied $m_caderousse$ i dont know but what you re
#right# so you #will# say #nothing# asked the #abbé# why what good would it do asked $m_caderousse$
if the poor lad were living and came to me and begged that i would candidly tell which were his true and which his false #friend# why perhaps i should not hesitate
but you tell me he is no more and therefore can have #nothing# to do with hatred or revenge so let all such #feeling# be buried with him
you prefer then said the #abbé# that i should bestow on #man# you say are false and treacherous the reward intended for faithful friendship
you say truly the gift of poor $edmond_dantès$ was not meant for such traitors as $m_fernand_mondego$ and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ besides what would it be to them
that is true enough returned $m_caderousse$ no more than a drop of #water# in the ocean
remember chimed in $la_carconte$ those two could crush you at a single blow how so inquired the #abbé#
are these #person# then so rich and powerful do you not know their history i do not
pray relate it to me $m_caderousse$ seemed to reflect for a few #moment# then said no truly it would take up too much #time#
you are at #liberty# either to speak or be silent just as you please for my own #part# i respect your scruples and admire your sentiments so let the #matter# #end#
well my good #friend# returned the #abbé# in a #tone# that indicated utter indifference on his #part# i shall do my #duty# as conscientiously as i can and fulfil my #promise# to the dying #man#
so saying the #abbé# again drew the small #box# from his #pocket# opened it and contrived to hold it in such a #light# that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed before the dazzled gaze of $m_caderousse$
my first #business# #will# be to dispose of this #diamond# #wife# wife cried he in a hoarse #voice# come here
exclaimed $la_carconte$ rising and descending to the #chamber# with a tolerably firm #step# what #diamond# are you talking about
it is a beautiful #diamond# left by poor $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ to be sold and the #money# divided between his #father# $mercédès$ his betrothed bride $m_fernand_mondego$ $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and myself
#diamond# why did you not hear all we said inquired $m_caderousse$ the jewel is worth at least fifty thousand #franc#
oh what a magnificent jewel cried the astonished #woman# the fifth #part# of the profits from this #stone# belongs to us then
with the addition of an equal division of that #part# intended for the elder $m_dantès$ which i believe myself at #liberty# to divide equally with the four survivors
does it not asked $m_caderousse$ it does replied the #abbé# and why among us four inquired $m_caderousse$
i dont call those #friend# who betray and ruin you murmured the #wife# in her #turn# in a low muttering #voice#
as being the #friend# $edmond_dantès$ esteemed most faithful and devoted to him of #course# not rejoined $m_caderousse$ quickly no more do i and that was what i was observing to this #gentleman# just now
i said i looked upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery perhaps #crime# remember answered the #abbé# calmly as he replaced the jewel and its #case# in the #pocket# of his cassock
you #will# have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both $m_fernand_mondego$ and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ in #order# that i may execute $edmond_dantès$ last #wish#
it is your fault not mine that i do so the agitation of $m_caderousse$ became extreme and large drops of perspiration rolled from his heated #brow#
as he saw the #abbé# rise from his #seat# and go towards the #door# as though to ascertain if his #horse# were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey $m_caderousse$ and his #wife# exchanged #look# of deep meaning
there you see #wife# said the former this splendid #diamond# might all be ours if we chose
do you believe it why surely a #man# of his holy profession would not deceive us well replied $la_carconte$
so saying she once more climbed the #staircase# leading to her #chamber# her #body# convulsed with chills and her teeth rattling in her #head# in #spite# of the intense heat of the weather
arrived at the top stair she turned round and called out in a warning #tone# to her #husband# $gaspard_caderousse$ consider well what you are about to do
do as you like for my #part# i wash my #hand# of the #affair# i have both reflected and decided answered he
$la_carconte$ then entered her #chamber# the flooring of which creaked beneath her heavy uncertain tread as she proceeded towards her armchair into which she fell as though exhausted
well asked the #abbé# as he returned to the #apartment# below what have you made up your #mind# to do
to tell you all i know was the reply i certainly think you act wisely in so doing said the #priest#
not because i have the least #desire# to learn #anything# you may please to conceal from me but simply that if through your assistance i could distribute the legacy according to the #wish# of the testator why so much the better that is all
i #hope# it may be so replied $m_caderousse$ his #face# flushed with cupidity i am all #attention# said the #abbé#
we might be interrupted in the most interesting #part# of my #story# which would be a #pity# and it is as well that your #visit# hither should be made known only to ourselves
with these #word# he went stealthily to the #door# which he closed and by #way# of still greater precaution bolted and barred it as he was accustomed to do at #night#
stop a #minute# answered $m_caderousse$ during this #time# the #abbé# had chosen his #place# for listening at his ease
he removed his #seat# into a #corner# of the #room# where he himself would be in deep #shadow# while the #light# would be fully thrown on the narrator then with #head# bent down and #hand# clasped or rather clenched together he prepared to give his whole #attention# to $m_caderousse$ who seated himself on the little stool exactly opposite to him
remember this is no #affair# of mine said the trembling #voice# of $la_carconte$ as though through the flooring of her #chamber# she viewed the #scene# that was enacting below
enough enough replied $m_caderousse$ say no more about it i #will# take all the consequences upon myself
and he began his #story# #chapter# the #story# first #sir# said $m_caderousse$ you must make me a #promise#
why if you ever make #use# of the details i am about to give you that you #will# never let #anyone# know that it was i who supplied them for the #person# of whom i am about to talk are rich and powerful and if they only laid the tips of their #finger# on me i should break to #piece# like #glass#
what is that inquired the #abbé# make yourself easy my #friend# replied the #abbé# i am a #priest# and confessions die in my breast
speak then without reserve as without hatred tell the #truth# the whole #truth# i do not know never may know the #person# of whom you are about to speak besides i am an italian and not a frenchman and belong to god and not to #man# and i shall shortly retire to my convent which i have only quitted to fulfil the last #wish# of a dying #man#
recollect our only #desire# is to carry out in a fitting #manner# the last #wish# of our #friend# this positive assurance seemed to give $m_caderousse$ a little courage
i #will# i even believe i ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor $edmond_dantès$ #thought# so sincere and unquestionable
said the #abbé# $edmond_dantès$ talked to me a great deal about the old #man# for whom he had the deepest #love#
well then under these #circumstance# said $m_caderousse$ begin with his #father# if you please the history is a sad #one# #sir# said $m_caderousse$ shaking his #head#
perhaps you know all the earlier #part# of it yes answered the #abbé# $edmond_dantès$ related to me #everything# until the #moment# when he was arrested in a small cabaret close to marseilles
at la réserve oh yes i can see it all before me this #moment# was it not his betrothal feast
it was and the feast that began so gayly had a very sorrowful ending a #police# commissary followed by four #soldier# entered and $m_dantès$ was arrested
$m_dantès$ himself only knew that which personally concerned him for he never beheld again the five #person# i have named to you or heard mention of #anyone# of them
yes and up to this #point# i know all said the #priest# well when $m_dantès$ was arrested $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ hastened to obtain the particulars and they were very sad
the old #man# returned alone to his home folded up his wedding suit with #tear# in his #eye# and paced up and down his #chamber# the whole #day# and would not go to #bed# at all for i was underneath him and heard him walking the whole #night# and for myself i assure you i could not sleep either for the #grief# of the poor #father# gave me great uneasiness and every #step# he took went to my #heart# as really as if his #foot# had pressed against my breast
she did not obtain it however and went to #visit# the old #man# when she saw him so miserable and #heart# broken having passed a sleepless #night# and not touched food since the previous #day# she wished him to go with her that she might take #care# of him but the old #man# would not consent
the next #day# $mercédès$ came to implore the protection of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ no was the old #man# reply
i #will# not leave this $house_of_peers$ for my poor dear #boy# loves me better than #anything# in the #world# and if he gets out of #prison# he #will# come and see me the first #thing# and what would he think if i did not wait here for him
i heard all this from the #window# for i was anxious that $mercédès$ should persuade the old #man# to accompany her for his footsteps over my #head# #night# and #day#
did not leave me a #moment# repose but did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old #man# asked the #abbé#
ah #sir# replied $m_caderousse$ we cannot console those who #will# not be consoled and he was #one# of these
#one# #night# however i heard his sobs and i could not resist my #desire# to go up to him but when i reached his #door# he was no longer weeping but praying
i cannot now repeat to you #sir# all the eloquent #word# and imploring language he made #use# of it was more than piety it was more than #grief# and i who am no canter and hate the jesuits said then to myself
it is really well and i am very glad that i have not any #child# for if i were a #father# and felt such excessive #grief# as the old #man# does and did not find in my memory or #heart# all he is now saying i should throw myself into the #sea# at once for i could not bear it
besides i know not why but he seemed to dislike seeing me poor #father# murmured the #priest#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ and $mercédès$ came to see him but his #door# was closed and although i was certain he was at home he would not make any #answer#
#one# #day# when #contrary# to his custom he had admitted $mercédès$ and the poor #girl# in #spite# of her own #grief# and #despair# endeavored to console him he said to her be assured my dear #daughter# he is dead and instead of expecting him it is he who is awaiting us
from #day# to #day# he lived on alone and more and more solitary i am quite happy for i am the oldest and of #course# shall see him first
however well disposed a #person# may be why you see we leave off after a #time# seeing #person# who are in sorrow they make #one# melancholy and so at last old $m_dantès$ was left all to himself and i only saw from #time# to #time# #stranger# go up to him and come down again with some bundle they tried to hide but i guessed what these bundles were and that he sold by degrees what he had to pay for his subsistence
at #length# the poor old #fellow# reached the #end# of all he had he owed three #quarter# rent and they threatened to #turn# him out he begged for another week which was granted to him
i know this because the landlord came into my #apartment# when he left his for the first three #day# i heard him walking about as usual but on the fourth i heard #nothing#
the #door# was closed but i looked through the keyhole and saw him so pale and haggard that believing him very ill i went and told $m_maximilian_morrel$ and then ran on to $mercédès$
they both came immediately $m_maximilian_morrel$ bringing a #doctor# and the #doctor# said it was inflammation of the bowels and ordered him a limited diet
i then resolved to go up to him at all risks i was there too and i never shall forget the old #man# #smile# at this prescription
from that #time# he received all who came he had an excuse for not eating any more the #doctor# had put him on a diet
the #abbé# uttered a kind of groan the #story# #interest# you does it not #sir# inquired $m_caderousse$
$mercédès$ came again and she found him so altered that she was even more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home
this was $m_maximilian_morrel$ #wish# also who would fain have conveyed the old #man# against his consent but the old #man# resisted and cried so that they were actually frightened
$mercédès$ remained therefore by his bedside and $m_maximilian_morrel$ went away making a #sign# to the catalan that he had left his purse on the chimney #piece# but availing himself of the #doctor# #order# the old #man# would not take any sustenance at #length# after nine #day# of #despair# and fasting the old #man# died cursing those who had caused his misery and saying to $mercédès$
yes replied the #abbé# it is very affecting if you ever see my $edmond_dantès$ again tell him i die blessing him
the #abbé# rose from his #chair# made two #turn# round the #chamber# and pressed his trembling #hand# against his parched throat
and you believe he died of hunger #sir# of hunger said $m_caderousse$ i am as certain of it as that we two are christians
the #abbé# with a shaking #hand# seized a #glass# of #water# that was standing by him #half# full swallowed it at #one# gulp and then resumed his #seat# with red #eye# and pale cheeks
this was indeed a horrid #event# said he in a hoarse #voice# the more so #sir# as it was #man# and not god s
doing tell me of those #man# said the #abbé# and remember too he added in an almost menacing #tone#
you have promised to tell me #everything# tell me therefore who are these #man# who killed the #son# with #despair# and the #father# with famine
two #man# jealous of him #sir# #one# from #love# and the #other# from ambition $m_fernand_mondego$ and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ how was this jealousy manifested
speak on they denounced $edmond_dantès$ as a bonapartist agent which of the two denounced him which was the real delinquent
both #sir# #one# with a #letter# and the #other# put it in the post and where was this #letter# written
at la réserve the #day# before the betrothal feast twas so then twas so then murmured the #abbé#
oh $abbé_faria$ faria how well did you judge #man# and #thing# what did you please to say #sir# asked $m_caderousse$
it was $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who wrote the denunciation with his left #hand# that his writing might not be recognized and $m_fernand_mondego$ who put it in the post
#nothing# nothing replied the #priest# go on but exclaimed the #abbé# suddenly you were there yourself
the #abbé# saw he had overshot the mark and he added quickly no #one# but in #order# to have known #everything# so well you must have been an #eye# witness
i said $m_caderousse$ astonished who told you i was there true true said $m_caderousse$ in a choking #voice#
i was there and did you not remonstrate against such infamy asked the #abbé# if not you were an accomplice
#sir# replied $m_caderousse$ they had made me drink to such an excess that i nearly lost all perception i had only an indistinct understanding of what was passing around me
i said all that a #man# in such a state could say but they both assured me that it was a jest they were carrying on and perfectly harmless
next #day# #sir# you must have seen plain enough what they had been doing yet you said #nothing# though you were present when $m_dantès$ was arrested
next #day# yes #sir# i was there and very anxious to speak but $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ restrained me
and did really put in to the #island# of $elba$ if he is really charged with a #letter# for the bonapartist committee at paris and if they find this #letter# upon him those who have supported him #will# pass for his accomplices
if he should really be guilty said he i confess i had my #fear# in the state in which politics then were and i held my tongue
it was cowardly i confess but it was not criminal i understand you allowed #matter# to take their #course# that was all
i often ask pardon of god i swear to you because this action the only #one# with which i have seriously to reproach myself in all my #life# is no #doubt# the cause of my abject condition
yes #sir# answered $m_caderousse$ and remorse preys on me #night# and #day# i am expiating a #moment# of selfishness and so i always say to $la_carconte$ when she complains
hold your tongue #woman# it is the #will# of god and $m_caderousse$ bowed his #head# with every #sign# of real repentance
well #sir# said the #abbé# you have spoken unreservedly and thus to accuse yourself is to deserve pardon
unfortunately $edmond_dantès$ is dead and has not pardoned me he did not know said the #abbé# but he knows it all now interrupted $m_caderousse$
they say the dead know #everything# there was a brief #silence# the #abbé# rose and paced up and down pensively and then resumed his #seat#
you have two or three #time# mentioned a $m_maximilian_morrel$ he said who was he the owner of the $pharaon$ and patron of $m_dantès$
and what #part# did he play in this sad drama inquired the #abbé# the #part# of an honest #man# full of courage and real regard
when the emperor returned he wrote implored threatened and so energetically that on the second restoration he was persecuted as a bonapartist
ten #time# as i told you he came to see $m_dantès$ #father# and offered to receive him in his own $house_of_peers$ and the #night# or two before his #death# as i have already said he left his purse on the mantelpiece with which they paid the old #man# debts and buried him decently and so $edmond_dantès$ #father# died as he had lived without doing harm to #anyone#
twenty #time# he interceded for $edmond_dantès$ i have the purse still by me a large #one# made of red silk
and asked the #abbé# is $m_maximilian_morrel$ still alive yes replied $m_caderousse$ in that #case# replied the #abbé# he should be a #man# blessed of god rich happy
$m_caderousse$ smiled bitterly yes happy as myself said he what $m_maximilian_morrel$ unhappy exclaimed the #abbé# he is reduced almost to the last extremity nay he is almost at the #point# of dishonor
after five and twenty #year# of labor after having acquired a most honorable #name# in the trade of marseilles $m_maximilian_morrel$ is utterly ruined he has lost five ships in two #year# has suffered by the bankruptcy of three large #house# and his only #hope# now is in that very $pharaon$ which poor $m_dantès$ commanded and which is expected from the indies with a cargo of cochineal and indigo
how yes continued $m_caderousse$ so it is if this ship founders like the #other# he is a ruined #man#
yes he has a #wife# who through #everything# has behaved like an angel he has a #daughter# who was about to marry the #man# she loved but whose #family# now #will# not allow him to we
and has the unfortunate #man# #wife# or #child# inquired the #abbé# the #daughter# of a ruined #man#
he has besides a #son# a lieutenant in the army and as you may suppose all this instead of lessening only augments his sorrows
if he were alone in the #world# he would blow out his brains and there would be an #end#
you see i who never did a bad action but that i have told you of am in destitution with my poor #wife# dying of fever before my very #eye# and i unable to do #anything# in the #world# for her i shall die of hunger as old $m_dantès$ did while $m_fernand_mondego$ and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ are rolling in wealth
horrible ejaculated the #priest# and it is thus heaven recompenses virtue #sir# added $m_caderousse$ how is that
because their deeds have brought them good #fortune# while honest #man# have been reduced to misery what has become of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ the instigator and therefore the most guilty
why he left marseilles and was taken on the recommendation of $m_maximilian_morrel$ who did not know his #crime# as cashier into a spanish bank
during the war with spain he was employed in the commissariat of the french army and made a #fortune# then with that #money# he speculated in the funds and trebled or quadrupled his capital and having first married his #banker# #daughter# who left him a widower he has married a second #time# a widow a #madame# de nargonne #daughter# of de servieux the #king#
he is a millionaire and they have made him a #baron# and now he is the #baron# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with a fine residence in the rue du mont blanc with ten #horse# in his stables six footmen in his antechamber and i know not how many #million# in his strongbox
what has become of him chamberlain who is in high favor at #court# ah said the #abbé# in a peculiar #tone#
#happiness# or unhappiness is the #secret# known but to #one# self and the #wall# walls have ears but no tongue but if a large #fortune# produces #happiness# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is happy
he is happy happy who can #answer# for that and $m_fernand_mondego$ fernand why much the same #story#
but how could a poor catalan fisher #boy# without education or resources make a #fortune# i confess this staggers me
and it has staggered everybody there must have been in his #life# some strange #secret# that no #one# knows
but then by what visible #step# has he attained this high #fortune# or high #position# both #sir# he has both #fortune# and #position#
both this must be impossible it would seem so but listen and you #will# understand some #day# before the #return# of the emperor $m_fernand_mondego$ was drafted
the bourbons left him quietly enough at the catalans but $napoleon$ returned a special levy was made and $m_fernand_mondego$ was compelled to join
i went too but as i was older than $m_fernand_mondego$ and had just married my poor #wife# i was only sent to the coast
$m_fernand_mondego$ was enrolled in the active army went to the frontier with his regiment and was at the battle of ligny
the #night# after that battle he was sentry at the #door# of a general who carried on a #secret# correspondence with the #enemy#
that same #night# the general was to go over to the english he proposed to $m_fernand_mondego$ to accompany him $m_fernand_mondego$ agreed to do so deserted his post and followed the general
$m_fernand_mondego$ would have been #court# martialed if $napoleon$ had remained on the throne but his action was rewarded by the bourbons
he returned to france with the epaulet of sub lieutenant and as the protection of the general who is in the highest favor was accorded to him he was a #captain# in during the spanish war that is to say at the #time# when $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ made his early speculations
$m_fernand_mondego$ was a spaniard and being sent to spain to ascertain the #feeling# of his #fellow# countrymen found $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ there got on very intimate terms with him won over the support of the royalists at the capital and in the provinces received #promise# and made pledges on his own #part# guided his regiment by paths known to himself alone through the mountain gorges which were held by the royalists and in #fact# rendered such #service# in this brief campaign that after the taking of trocadero he was made colonel and received the title of #count# and the cross of an #officer# of the legion of #honor#
the war with spain being ended $m_fernand_mondego$ career was checked by the long peace which seemed likely to endure throughout europe
destiny destiny murmured the #abbé# yes but listen this was not all greece only had risen against turkey and had begun her war of independence all #eye# were turned towards athens
it was the fashion to #pity# and support the greeks the french government without protecting them openly as you know gave #countenance# to volunteer assistance
$m_fernand_mondego$ sought and obtained leave to go and serve in greece still having his #name# kept on the army roll m
some #time# after it was stated that the comte de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ this was the #name# he bore had entered the #service# of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ with the rank of instructor general
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ was killed as you know but before he died he recompensed the #service# of $m_fernand_mondego$ by leaving him a considerable #sum# with which he returned to france when he was gazetted lieutenant general
so that now inquired the #abbé# so that now continued $m_caderousse$ he owns a magnificent $house_of_peers$ no
$rue_du_helder$ paris the #abbé# opened his mouth hesitated for a #moment# then making an #effort# at self control he said
and $mercédès$ they tell me that she has disappeared disappeared said $m_caderousse$ yes as the sun disappears to rise the next #day# with still more splendor
has she made a #fortune# also inquired the #abbé# with an ironical #smile# $mercédès$ is at this #moment# #one# of the greatest #lady# in paris replied $m_caderousse$
go on said the #abbé# it seems as if i were listening to the #story# of a #dream# but i have seen #thing# so extraordinary that what you tell me seems less astonishing than it otherwise might
$mercédès$ was at first in the deepest #despair# at the blow which deprived her of $edmond_dantès$ i have told you of her attempts to propitiate $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ her devotion to the elder $m_dantès$
in the midst of her #despair# a new affliction overtook her this was the departure of $m_fernand_mondego$ of $m_fernand_mondego$ whose #crime# she did not know and whom she regarded as her #brother#
$m_fernand_mondego$ went and $mercédès$ remained alone three #month# passed and still she wept no news of $edmond_dantès$ no news of $m_fernand_mondego$ no companionship save that of an old #man# who was dying with #despair#
#one# #evening# after a #day# of accustomed vigil at the angle of two #road# leading to marseilles from the catalans she returned to her home more depressed than ever
suddenly she heard a #step# she knew turned anxiously around the #door# opened and $m_fernand_mondego$ dressed in the uniform of a sub lieutenant stood before her
it was not the #one# she wished for most but it seemed as if a #part# of her past #life# had returned to her
$mercédès$ seized $m_fernand_mondego$ #hand# with a transport which he took for #love# but which was only #joy# at being no longer alone in the #world# and seeing at last a #friend# after long #hour# of solitary sorrow
and then it must be confessed $m_fernand_mondego$ had never been hated he was only not precisely loved another possessed all $mercédès$ #heart# that #other# was absent had disappeared perhaps was dead
at this last #thought# $mercédès$ burst into a flood of #tear# and wrung her #hand# in agony but the #thought# which she had always repelled before when it was suggested to her by another came now in full force upon her #mind# and then too old $m_dantès$ incessantly said to her
the old #man# died as i have told you had he lived $mercédès$ perchance had not become the #wife# of another for he would have been there to reproach her infidelity
our $edmond_dantès$ is dead if he were not he would #return# to us $m_fernand_mondego$ saw this and when he learned of the old #man# #death# he returned
at his first coming he had not said a #word# of #love# to $mercédès$ at the second he reminded her that he loved her
he was now a lieutenant $mercédès$ begged for six #month# more in which to await and mourn for $edmond_dantès$
so that said the #abbé# with a bitter #smile# that makes eighteen #month# in all what more could the most devoted lover #desire#
then he murmured the #word# of the english poet frailty thy #name# is #woman# six #month# afterwards continued $m_caderousse$ the #marriage# took #place# in the church of accoules
the very church in which she was to have married $edmond_dantès$ murmured the #priest# there was only a change of bridegrooms
but although in the #eye# of the #world# she appeared calm she nearly fainted as she passed la réserve where eighteen #month# before the betrothal had been celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved had she looked to the bottom of her #heart#
well $mercédès$ was married proceeded $m_caderousse$ $m_fernand_mondego$ more happy but not more at his ease for i saw at this #time# he was in constant dread of $edmond_dantès$ #return#
$m_fernand_mondego$ was very anxious to get his #wife# away and to depart himself there were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with the catalans and eight #day# after the wedding they left marseilles
yes during the spanish war at perpignan where $m_fernand_mondego$ had left her she was attending to the education of her #son#
did you ever see $mercédès$ again inquired the #priest# the #abbé# started her #son# said he
yes replied $m_caderousse$ little $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but then to be able to instruct her #child# continued the #abbé#
she must have received an education herself i understood from $edmond_dantès$ that she was the #daughter# of a simple fisherman beautiful but uneducated
$mercédès$ might have been a queen #sir# if the crown were to be placed on the #head# of the loveliest and most intelligent
oh replied $m_caderousse$ did he know so little of his lovely betrothed $m_fernand_mondego$ #fortune# was already waxing great and she developed with his growing #fortune#
besides i believe between ourselves she did this in #order# to distract her #mind# that she might forget and she only filled her #head# in #order# to alleviate the weight on her #heart#
she learned #drawing# music #everything# but now her #position# in #life# is assured continued $m_caderousse$ no #doubt# #fortune# and #honor# have comforted her she is rich a #countess# and yet $m_caderousse$ paused
and yet what asked the #abbé# yet i am sure she is not happy said $m_caderousse$ what makes you believe this
why when i found myself utterly destitute i #thought# my old #friend# would perhaps assist me so i went to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who would not even receive me
i called on $m_fernand_mondego$ who sent me a hundred #franc# by his #valet# de chambre then you did not see either of them
no but #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ saw me how was that as i went away a purse fell at my #foot#
it contained five and twenty $louis_xviii$ i raised my #head# quickly and saw $mercédès$ who at once shut the blind and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
oh he never was a #friend# of mine i did not know him and i had #nothing# to ask of him
asked the #abbé# do you not know what became of him and the share he had in $edmond_dantès$ #misfortune#
no i only know that some #time# after $edmond_dantès$ arrest he married $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ de $madame_de_saint_méran$ and soon after left marseilles no #doubt# he has been as lucky as the #rest# no #doubt# he is as rich as $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ as high in station as $m_fernand_mondego$
i only as you see have remained poor wretched and forgotten you are mistaken my #friend# replied the #abbé#
god may seem sometimes to forget for a #time# while his #justice# reposes but there always comes a #moment# when he remembers
and behold a #proof# as he spoke the #abbé# took the #diamond# from his #pocket# and giving it to $m_caderousse$ said
here my #friend# take this #diamond# it is yours what for me only cried $m_caderousse$ ah #sir# do not jest with me
this #diamond# was to have been shared among his #friend# $edmond_dantès$ had #one# #friend# only and thus it cannot be divided
take the #diamond# then and sell it it is worth fifty thousand #franc# and i repeat my #wish# that this #sum# may suffice to release you from your wretchedness
oh #sir# said $m_caderousse$ putting out #one# #hand# timidly and with the #other# wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his #brow# oh #sir# do not make a jest of the #happiness# or #despair# of a #man#
i know what #happiness# and what #despair# are and i never make a jest of such #feeling#
in exchange he continued give me the red silk purse that $m_maximilian_morrel$ left on old $m_dantès$ chimney #piece# and which you tell me is still in your #hand#
$m_caderousse$ more and more astonished went toward a large oaken cupboard opened it and gave the #abbé# a long purse of faded red silk round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt
take it then but in exchange $m_caderousse$ who touched the #diamond# withdrew his #hand# the #abbé# smiled the #abbé# took it and in #return# gave $m_caderousse$ the #diamond#
oh you are a #man# of god #sir# cried $m_caderousse$ for no #one# knew that $edmond_dantès$ had given you this #diamond# and you might have kept it
which said the #abbé# to himself you would have done the #abbé# rose took his hat and gloves
well he said all you have told me is perfectly true then and i may believe it in every particular
see #sir# replied $m_caderousse$ in this #corner# is a crucifix in holy wood here on this shelf is my #wife# testament open this book and i #will# swear upon it with my #hand# on the crucifix
salvation my faith as a christian i have told #everything# to you as it occurred and as the recording angel #will# tell it to the ear of god at the #day# of the last judgment
i #will# swear to you by my soul tis well said the #abbé# convinced by his #manner# and #tone# that $m_caderousse$ spoke the #truth#
tis well and may this #money# profit you adieu i go far from #man# who thus so bitterly injure each #other#
the #abbé# with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic #thank# of $m_caderousse$ opened the #door# himself got out and mounted his #horse# once more saluted the innkeeper who kept uttering his loud farewells and then returned by the #road# he had travelled in coming
when $m_caderousse$ turned around he saw behind him $la_carconte$ paler and trembling more than ever is then all that i have heard really true she inquired
what that he has given the #diamond# to us only inquired $m_caderousse$ #half# bewildered with #joy# yes #nothing# more true
see here it is the #woman# gazed at it a #moment# and then said in a gloomy #voice# suppose it false
$m_caderousse$ started and turned pale false he muttered false why should that #man# give me a false #diamond#
to get your #secret# without paying for it you blockhead $m_caderousse$ remained for a #moment# aghast under the weight of such an #idea#
he said taking up his hat which he placed on the red handkerchief tied round his #head# we #will# soon find out
why the fair is on at beaucaire there are always jewellers from paris there and i #will# show it to them
#look# after the $house_of_peers$ #wife# and i shall be back in two #hour# and $m_caderousse$ left the $house_of_peers$ in haste and ran rapidly in the direction opposite to that which the #priest# had taken
oh in what #way# fifty thousand #franc# muttered $la_carconte$ when left alone it is a large #sum# of #money# but it is not a #fortune# volume two m m
the #day# after that in which the #scene# we have just described had taken #place# on the #road# between bellegarde and beaucaire a #man# of about thirty or two and thirty dressed in a bright blue frock coat nankeen trousers and a white waistcoat having the #appearance# and accent of an englishman presented himself before the mayor of marseilles
#chapter# the #prison# register #sir# said he i am chief clerk of the $house_of_peers$ of $thomson_french_of_rome$
we have a hundred thousand #franc# or thereabouts loaned on their securities and we are a little uneasy at reports that have reached us that the firm is on the brink of ruin
we are and have been these ten #year# connected with the $house_of_peers$ of $m_maximilian_morrel$ #son# of marseilles i have come therefore express from rome to ask you for information
#sir# replied the mayor i know very well that during the last four or five #year# #misfortune# has seemed to pursue $m_maximilian_morrel$
he has lost four or five #vessel# and suffered by three or four bankruptcies but it is not for me although i am a creditor myself to the amount of ten thousand #franc# to give any information as to the state of his finances
ask of me as mayor what is my #opinion# of $m_maximilian_morrel$ and i shall say that he is a #man# honorable to the last degree and who has up to this #time# fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality
this is all i can say #sir# if you #wish# to learn more address yourself to $m_de_boville$ the #inspector# of #prison#
he has i believe two hundred thousand #franc# in $m_maximilian_morrel$ #hand# and if there be any #ground# for apprehension as this is a greater amount than mine you #will# most probably find him better informed than myself
the englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy made his bow and went away proceeding with a characteristic british stride towards the #street# mentioned
$m_de_boville$ was in his private #room# and the englishman on perceiving him made a gesture of surprise which seemed to indicate that it was not the first #time# he had been in his #presence#
as to $m_de_boville$ he was in such a state of #despair# that it was evident all the faculties of his #mind# absorbed in the #thought# which occupied him at the #moment# did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past
the englishman with the coolness of his nation addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of marseilles
no rue de nouailles oh #sir# exclaimed $m_de_boville$ your #fear# are unfortunately but too well founded and you see before you a #man# in #despair#
i had two hundred thousand #franc# placed in the #hand# of $m_maximilian_morrel$ #son# these two hundred thousand #franc# were the dowry of my #daughter# who was to be married in a fortnight and these two hundred thousand #franc# were payable #half# on the th of this #month# and the #other# #half# on the th of next #month#
i had informed $m_maximilian_morrel$ of my #desire# to have these payments punctually and he has been here within the last #half# #hour# to tell me that if his ship the $pharaon$ did not come into port on the th he would be wholly unable to make this payment
but said the englishman this #look# very much like a suspension of payment it #look# more like bankruptcy
the englishman appeared to reflect a #moment# and then said from which it would appear #sir# that this credit inspires you with considerable apprehension
exclaimed $m_de_boville$ despairingly to tell you the #truth# i consider it lost well then i #will# buy it of you
you yes i but at a tremendous discount of #course# no for two hundred thousand #franc# our $house_of_peers$ added the englishman with a laugh does not do #thing# in that #way#
and the englishman drew from his #pocket# a bundle of bank #note# which might have been twice the #sum# $m_de_boville$ feared to lose
and you #will# pay ready #money# a ray of #joy# passed across $m_de_boville$ #countenance# yet he made an #effort# at self control and said
#sir# i ought to tell you that in all probability you #will# not realize six per cent of this #sum#
that no #affair# of mine replied the englishman that is the #affair# of the $house_of_peers$ of $thomson_french_of_rome$ in whose #name# i act
but all i know #sir# is that i am ready to #hand# you over this #sum# in exchange for your assignment of the debt
they have perhaps some motive to serve in hastening the ruin of a rival firm i only ask a brokerage
of #course# that is perfectly just cried $m_de_boville$ the commission is usually #one# and a #half# #will# you have two three
five per cent or even more whatever you say #sir# replied the englishman laughing i am like my $house_of_peers$ and do not do such #thing#
no the commission i ask is quite different #name# it #sir# i beg you are the #inspector# of #prison#
i have been so these fourteen #year# you keep the registers of entries and departures i do
to these registers there are added #note# relative to the #prisoner# there are special reports on every #prisoner#
i have since learned that he was confined in the château if and i should like to learn some particulars of his #death#
well #sir# i was educated at rome by a poor devil of an #abbé# who disappeared suddenly
what was his #name# the $abbé_faria$ oh i recollect him perfectly cried $m_de_boville$ he was crazy
so they said oh he was decidedly very possibly but what #sort# of madness was it
he pretended to know of an immense #treasure# and offered vast #sum# to the government if they would liberate him
poor devil and he is dead yes #sir# five or six #month# ago last february you have a good memory #sir# to recollect dates so well
may i ask what that was said the englishman with an #expression# of curiosity which a close observer would have been astonished at discovering in his phlegmatic #countenance#
i recollect this because the poor devil #death# was accompanied by a singular incident oh dear yes #sir#
the #abbé# dungeon was forty or fifty #foot# distant from that of #one# of $bonaparte$ emissaries #one# of those who had contributed the most to the #return# of the usurper in a very resolute and very dangerous #man#
i myself had occasion to see this #man# in or and we could only go into his dungeon with a file of #soldier#
indeed said the englishman yes replied $m_de_boville$ that #man# made a deep impression on me i shall never forget his #countenance#
and you say #sir# he interposed that the two dungeons were separated by a #distance# of fifty #foot# but it appears that this $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$
it appears #sir# that this $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ had procured tools or made them for they found a tunnel through which the #prisoner# held communication with #one# another
the englishman smiled imperceptibly this dangerous #man# #name# was $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ this tunnel was dug no #doubt# with an intention of escape
no #doubt# but unfortunately for the #prisoner# the $abbé_faria$ had an attack of catalepsy and died that must have cut short the projects of escape
for the dead #man# yes replied $m_de_boville$ but not for the survivor on the #contrary# this $m_dantès$ saw a #mean# of accelerating his escape
he no #doubt# #thought# that #prisoner# who died in the château if were interred in an ordinary burial #ground# and he conveyed the dead #man# into his own cell took his #place# in the sack in which they had sewed up the corpse and awaited the #moment# of interment
as i have already told you #sir# he was a very dangerous #man# and fortunately by his own act disembarrassed the government of the #fear# it had on his #account#
it was a bold #step# and #one# that showed some courage remarked the englishman
the château if has no cemetery and they simply throw the dead into the #sea# after fastening a thirty six pound cannon ball to their #foot#
how was that how do you not comprehend no well observed the englishman as if he were slow of comprehension
well they fastened a thirty six pound ball to his #foot# and threw him into the #sea# really exclaimed the englishman
yes #sir# continued the #inspector# of #prison# you may imagine the amazement of the fugitive when he found himself flung headlong over the #rock#
no #matter# replied $m_de_boville$ in supreme good humor at the certainty of recovering his two hundred thousand #franc# no #matter# i can fancy it
i should like to have seen his #face# at that #moment# that would have been difficult
so can i said the englishman and he laughed too but he laughed as the english do at the #end# of his teeth
and he shouted with laughter and so continued the englishman who first gained his composure he was drowned
unquestionably so that the #governor# got rid of the dangerous and the crazy #prisoner# at the same #time#
precisely but some official document was drawn up as to this #affair# i suppose inquired the englishman
yes yes the mortuary deposition you understand $m_dantès$ relations if he had any might have some #interest# in knowing if he were dead or alive
so that now if there were #anything# to inherit from him they may do so with easy conscience he is dead and no mistake about it
oh yes and they may have the #fact# attested whenever they please so be it said the englishman
but to #return# to these registers true this #story# has diverted our #attention# from them excuse me
excuse you for what for the #story# by no #mean# it really seems to me very curious yes indeed
so #sir# you #wish# to see all relating to the poor #abbé# who really was gentleness itself yes you #will# much oblige me
go into my #study# here and i #will# show it to you and they both entered $m_de_boville$ #study#
the #inspector# begged the englishman to #seat# himself in an armchair and placed before him the register and documents relative to the château if giving him all the #time# he desired for the examination while $m_de_boville$ seated himself in a #corner# and began to read his newspaper
the englishman easily found the entries relative to the $abbé_faria$ but it seemed that the history which the #inspector# had related interested him greatly for after having perused the first documents he turned over the leaves until he reached the deposition respecting $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$
#everything# was here arranged in perfect #order# each register had its number each file of #paper# its #place# there he found #everything# arranged in due #order# the accusation examination $m_maximilian_morrel$ petition $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ marginal #note#
he folded up the accusation quietly and put it as quietly in his #pocket# read the examination and saw that the #name# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was not mentioned in it perused too the application dated th april in which $m_maximilian_morrel$ by the deputy #procureur#
advice exaggerated with the best intentions for $napoleon$ was then on the throne the #service# $m_dantès$ had rendered to the imperial cause #service# which $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ certificates rendered indisputable
this petition to $napoleon$ kept back by $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had become under the second restoration a terrible weapon against him in the #hand# of the #king# attorney
he was no longer astonished when he searched on to find in the register this #note# placed in a bracket against his #name# $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$
then he saw through the whole #thing# an inveterate bonapartist took an active #part# in the #return# from the #island# of $elba$
to be kept in strict solitary confinement and to be closely watched and guarded beneath these #line# was written in another #hand#
he compared the writing in the bracket with the writing of the certificate placed beneath $m_maximilian_morrel$ petition and discovered that the #note# in the bracket was the same writing as the certificate that is to say was in $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ handwriting
as to the #note# which accompanied this the englishman understood that it might have been added by some #inspector# who had taken a momentary #interest# in $m_dantès$ situation but who had from the remarks we have quoted found it impossible to give any #effect# to the #interest# he had felt
as we have said the #inspector# from discretion and that he might not disturb the $abbé_faria$ pupil in his researches had seated himself in a #corner# and was reading le drapeau blanc
he did not see the englishman fold up and #place# in his #pocket# the accusation written by $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ under the arbor of la réserve and which had the postmark marseilles th february delivery clock m
but it must be said that if he had seen it he attached so little importance to this scrap of #paper# and so much importance to his two hundred thousand #franc# that he would not have opposed whatever the englishman might do however irregular it might be
see #note# above #nothing# can be done #thank# said the latter closing the register with a slam
give me a simple assignment of your debt acknowledge therein the receipt of the cash and i #will# #hand# you over the #money#
he rose gave his #seat# to $m_de_boville$ who took it without ceremony and quickly drew up the required assignment while the englishman counted out the bank #note# on the #other# #side# of the desk
the $house_of_peers$ of $m_maximilian_morrel$ #son# #anyone# who had quitted marseilles a few #year# previously well acquainted with the interior of $m_maximilian_morrel$ warehouse and had returned at this date would have found a great change
instead of that #air# of #life# of comfort and of #happiness# that permeates a flourishing and prosperous #business# establishment instead of merry #face# at the #window# busy clerks hurrying to and fro in the long corridors instead of the #court# filled with bales of goods re echoing with the #cry# and the jokes of porters #one# would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and gloom
i have all i want now it is for me to perform my #promise# #chapter# out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted corridor and the empty office but two remained
#one# was a young #man# of three or four and twenty who was in #love# with $m_maximilian_morrel$ #daughter# and had remained with him in #spite# of the #effort# of his #friend# to induce him to withdraw the #other# was an old #one# eyed cashier called $cocles$ or cock #eye# a nickname given him by the young #man# who used to throng this vast now almost deserted bee hive and which had so completely replaced his real #name# that he would not in all probability have replied to #anyone# who addressed him by it
$cocles$ remained in $m_maximilian_morrel$ #service# and a most singular change had taken #place# in his #position# he had at the same #time# risen to the rank of cashier and sunk to the rank of a #servant#
he was however the same $cocles$ good patient devoted but inflexible on the #subject# of arithmetic the only #point# on which he would have stood firm against the #world# even against $m_maximilian_morrel$ and strong in the multiplication #table# which he had at his #finger# #end# no #matter# what scheme or what trap was laid to catch him
in the midst of the disasters that befell the $house_of_peers$ $cocles$ was the only #one# unmoved but this did not arise from a want of affection on the #contrary# from a firm conviction
like the rats that #one# by #one# forsake the doomed ship even before the #vessel# weighs anchor so all the numerous clerks had by degrees deserted the office and the warehouse
#everything# was as we have said a #question# of arithmetic to $cocles$ and during twenty #year# he had always seen all payments made with such exactitude that it seemed as impossible to him that the $house_of_peers$ should stop payment as it would to a miller that the river that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow
#nothing# had as yet occurred to shake $cocles$ belief the last #month# payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude $cocles$ had detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash and the same #evening# he had brought them to $m_maximilian_morrel$ who with a melancholy #smile# threw them into an almost empty drawer saying
$cocles$ had seen them go without thinking of inquiring the cause of their departure #thank# $cocles$ you are the pearl of cashiers
$cocles$ went away perfectly happy for this eulogium of $m_maximilian_morrel$ himself the pearl of the honest #man# of marseilles flattered him more than a present of fifty crowns
in #order# to meet the payments then due he had collected all his resources and fearing lest the report of his distress should get bruited abroad at marseilles when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity he went to the beaucaire fair to sell his #wife# and #daughter# jewels and a portion of his plate
but since the #end# of the #month# $m_maximilian_morrel$ had passed many an anxious #hour# by this #mean# the #end# of the #month# was passed but his resources were now exhausted
credit owing to the reports afloat was no longer to be had and to meet the #one# hundred thousand #franc# due on the th of the present #month# and the #one# hundred thousand #franc# due on the th of the next #month# to $m_de_boville$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ had in reality no #hope# but the #return# of the $pharaon$ of whose departure he had learnt from a #vessel# which had weighed anchor at the same #time# and which had already arrived in harbor
but this #vessel# which like the $pharaon$ came from calcutta had been in for a fortnight while no intelligence had been received of the $pharaon$
such was the state of #affair# when the #day# after his interview with $m_de_boville$ the confidential clerk of the $house_of_peers$ of $thomson_french_of_rome$ presented himself at $m_maximilian_morrel$
$m_emmanuel$ received him this young #man# was alarmed by the #appearance# of every new #face# for every new #face# might be that of a new creditor come in anxiety to #question# the #head# of the $house_of_peers$
the young #man# wishing to spare his employer the pain of this interview questioned the new comer but the #stranger# declared that he had #nothing# to say to $m_emmanuel$ and that his #business# was with $m_maximilian_morrel$ in #person#
$m_emmanuel$ sighed and summoned $cocles$ cocles appeared and the young #man# bade him conduct the #stranger# to $m_maximilian_morrel$ #apartment#
$cocles$ went first and the #stranger# followed him on the #staircase# they met a beautiful #girl# of sixteen or seventeen who looked with anxiety at the #stranger#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ is in his #room# is he not $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_julie$ said the cashier yes i think so at least said the young #girl# hesitatingly
go and see $cocles$ and if my #father# is there announce this #gentleman# it #will# be useless to announce me $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ returned the englishman
$m_maximilian_morrel$ does not know my #name# this worthy #gentleman# has only to announce the confidential clerk of the $house_of_peers$ of $thomson_french_of_rome$ with whom your #father# does #business#
she entered the office where $m_emmanuel$ was while $cocles$ by the aid of a key he possessed opened a #door# in the #corner# of a landing #place# on the second #staircase# conducted the #stranger# into an antechamber opened a second #door# which he closed behind him and after having left the clerk of the $house_of_peers$ of $thomson_french_of_rome$ alone returned and signed to him that he could enter
the englishman entered and found $m_maximilian_morrel$ seated at a #table# turning over the formidable columns of his ledger which contained the list of his liabilities
at the #sight# of the #stranger# $m_maximilian_morrel$ closed the ledger arose and offered a #seat# to the #stranger# and when he had seen him seated resumed his own #chair#
fourteen #year# had changed the worthy merchant who in his thirty sixth #year# at the #opening# of this history was now in his fiftieth his #hair# had turned white #time# and sorrow had ploughed deep furrows on his #brow# and his #look# once so firm and penetrating was now irresolute and wandering as if he feared being forced to fix his #attention# on some particular #thought# or #person#
the young #girl# turned pale and continued to descend while the #stranger# and $cocles$ continued to mount the #staircase# the englishman looked at him with an #air# of curiosity evidently mingled with #interest#
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ said $m_maximilian_morrel$ whose uneasiness was increased by this examination you #wish# to speak to me yes $monsieur_cavalcanti$ you are aware from whom i come
the $house_of_peers$ of $thomson_french_of_rome$ at least so my cashier tells me he has told you rightly
the $house_of_peers$ of $thomson_french_of_rome$ had or #franc# to pay this #month# in france and knowing your strict punctuality have collected all the bills bearing your signature and charged me as they became due to present them and to employ the #money# otherwise
$m_maximilian_morrel$ sighed deeply and passed his #hand# over his #forehead# which was covered with perspiration so then #sir# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ you hold bills of mine
yes and for a considerable #sum# what is the amount asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ with a #voice# he strove to render firm
an assignment of #franc# to our $house_of_peers$ by $m_de_boville$ the #inspector# of #prison# to whom they are due
here is said the englishman taking a quantity of #paper# from his #pocket# you acknowledge of #course# that you owe this #sum# to him
yes he placed the #money# in my #hand# at four and a #half# per cent nearly five #year# ago
just so and now here are #franc# payable shortly they are all signed by you and assigned to our $house_of_peers$ by the holders
when are you to pay #half# the th of this #month# #half# the th of next
i recognize them said $m_maximilian_morrel$ whose #face# was suffused as he #thought# that for the first #time# in his #life# he would be unable to #honor# his own signature
no i have for the #end# of the #month# these bills which have been assigned to us by the $house_of_peers$ of pascal and the $house_of_peers$ of wild turner of marseilles amounting to nearly #franc# in all #franc#
is this all it is impossible to describe what $m_maximilian_morrel$ suffered during this enumeration two hundred and eighty seven thousand five hundred #franc#
#silence# conceal from you that while your probity and exactitude up to this #moment# are universally acknowledged yet the report is current in marseilles that you are not able to meet your liabilities
repeated he yes #sir# replied the englishman i #will# not continued he after a #moment# at this almost brutal speech $m_maximilian_morrel$ turned deathly pale
and it is now more than four and twenty #year# since i received the direction of this $house_of_peers$ from my #father# who had himself conducted it for five and thirty #year#
#sir# said he up to this #time# never has #anything# bearing the signature of $m_maximilian_morrel$ #son# been dishonored
i know that replied the englishman but as a #man# of #honor# should #answer# another tell me fairly shall you pay these with the same punctuality
$m_maximilian_morrel$ shuddered and looked at the #man# who spoke with more assurance than he had hitherto shown to #question# frankly put said he a straightforward #answer# should be given
yes i shall pay if as i #hope# my #vessel# arrives safely for its arrival #will# again procure me the credit which the numerous accidents of which i have been the victim have deprived me but if the $pharaon$ should be lost and this last resource be gone the poor #man#
#eye# filled with #tear# well said the #other# if this last resource fail you well returned $m_maximilian_morrel$
it is a cruel #thing# to be forced to say but already used to #misfortune# i must habituate myself to shame
i #fear# i shall be forced to suspend payment have you no #friend# who could assist you $m_maximilian_morrel$ smiled mournfully
in #business# #sir# said he #one# has no #friend# only correspondents it is true murmured the englishman then you have but #one# #hope#
but #one# the last the last so that if this fail i am ruined completely ruined
a young #man# who still adheres to my fallen #fortune# passes a #part# of his #time# in a belvedere at the top of the $house_of_peers$ in #hope# of being the first to announce good news to me he has informed me of the arrival of this ship
as i was on my #way# here a #vessel# was coming into port i know it #sir#
and it is not yours no she is a bordeaux #vessel# la gironde she comes from india also but she is not mine
perhaps she has spoken to the $pharaon$ and brings you some tidings of her shall i tell you plainly #one# #thing# #sir#
i dread almost as much to receive any tidings of my #vessel# as to remain in #doubt# uncertainty is still #hope#
then in a low #voice# $m_maximilian_morrel$ added this delay is not natural the $pharaon$ left calcutta the th of february she ought to have been here a #month# ago
what is that said the englishman what is the meaning of that #noise# oh my god cried $m_maximilian_morrel$ turning pale what is it
a loud #noise# was heard on the stairs of #people# moving hastily and #half# stifled sobs $m_maximilian_morrel$ rose and advanced to the #door# but his #strength# failed him and he sank into a #chair#
the two #man# remained opposite #one# another $m_maximilian_morrel$ trembling in every limb the #stranger# gazing at him with an #air# of profound #pity#
the #stranger# fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs and that the footsteps which were those of several #person# stopped at the #door#
the #noise# had ceased but it seemed that $m_maximilian_morrel$ expected #something# something had occasioned the #noise# and #something# must follow a key was inserted in the lock of the first #door# and the creaking of hinges was audible
there are only two #person# who have the key to that #door# murmured $m_maximilian_morrel$ $cocles$ and $mademoiselle_julie$ at this #instant# the second #door# opened and the young #girl# her #eye# bathed with #tear# appeared
$m_maximilian_morrel$ rose tremblingly supporting himself by the #arm# of the #chair# he would have spoken but his #voice# failed him
oh #father# said she clasping her #hand# forgive your #child# for being the bearer of evil tidings $m_maximilian_morrel$ again changed color
$mademoiselle_julie$ threw herself into his #arm# oh #father# father murmured she courage the $pharaon$ has gone down then said $m_maximilian_morrel$ in a hoarse #voice#
the young #girl# did not speak but she made an affirmative #sign# with her #head# as she lay on her #father# breast
and the crew asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ saved said the #girl# saved by the crew of the #vessel# that has just entered the harbor
$m_maximilian_morrel$ raised his two #hand# to heaven with an #expression# of resignation and sublime gratitude #thank# my god said he at least thou strikest but me alone
a #tear# moistened the #eye# of the phlegmatic englishman come in come in said $m_maximilian_morrel$ for i presume you are all at the #door#
scarcely had he uttered those #word# when #madame# $m_maximilian_morrel$ entered weeping bitterly $m_emmanuel$ followed her and in the antechamber were visible the rough #face# of seven or eight #half# naked #sailor#
at the #sight# of these #man# the englishman started and advanced a #step# then restrained himself and retired into the farthest and most obscure #corner# of the #apartment#
#madame# $m_maximilian_morrel$ sat down by her #husband# and took #one# of his #hand# in hers $mademoiselle_julie$ still lay with her #head# on his #shoulder# $m_emmanuel$ stood in the centre of the #chamber# and seemed to form the link between $m_maximilian_morrel$ #family# and the #sailor# at the #door#
how did this happen said $m_maximilian_morrel$ draw nearer $penelon$ said the young #man# and tell us all about it
good #day# $m_maximilian_morrel$ said he as if he had just quitted marseilles the previous #evening# and had just returned from aix or toulon
an old seaman bronzed by the tropical sun advanced twirling the remains of a hat between his #hand#
the #captain# $m_maximilian_morrel$ he has stayed behind sick at palma but please god it wont be much and you #will# see him in a few #day#
good #day# $penelon$ returned $m_maximilian_morrel$ who could not refrain from smiling through his #tear# where is the #captain# all alive and hearty
$penelon$ rolled his quid in his cheek placed his #hand# before his mouth turned his #head# and sent a long jet of tobacco juice into the antechamber advanced his #foot# balanced himself and began
we were somewhere between cape blanc and cape boyador sailing with a fair breeze south south west after a week calm when #captain# gaumard comes up to me
well now tell your #story# $penelon$ you see $m_maximilian_morrel$ said he i was at the helm
i should tell you and says $penelon$ what do you think of those clouds coming up over there i was just then looking at them myself
why i think that they are rising faster than they have any #business# to do and that they would not be so black if they didnt #mean#
what do i think #captain# mischief that my #opinion# too said the #captain# and i ll take precautions accordingly we are carrying too much canvas
avast there all #hand# take in the studding sails and stow the flying jib it was #time# the squall was on us and the #vessel# began to heel
ah said the #captain# we have still too much canvas set all #hand# lower the mainsail five #minute# after it was down and we sailed under mizzen topsails and top gallant sails
well $penelon$ said the #captain# what makes you shake your #head# why i says i still think you ve got too much on
i think you re #right# answered he we shall have a gale a gale more than that we shall have a tempest or i dont know what what
you could see the wind coming like the dust at montredon luckily the #captain# understood his #business# take in two reefs in the top sails cried the #captain#
let go the bowlin haul the brace lower the top gallant sails haul out the reef tackles on the yards
that was not enough for those latitudes said the englishman i should have taken four reefs in the topsails and furled the spanker
$penelon$ put his #hand# over his #eye# and then stared at the #man# who thus criticized the manœuvres of his #captain#
we did better than that #sir# said the old #sailor# respectfully we put the helm up to run before the tempest ten #minute# after we struck our top sails and scudded under bare poles
his firm sonorous and unexpected #voice# made #everyone# start the #vessel# was very old to risk that said the englishman
eh it was that that did the #business# after pitching heavily for twelve #hour# we sprung a leak $penelon$ said the #captain#
i think we are sinking give me the helm and go down into the hold i gave him the helm and descended there was already three #foot# of #water#
all #hand# to the pumps i shouted but it was too late and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in
ah said i after four #hour# #work# since we are sinking let us sink we can die but once
is that the example you set $penelon$ #cry# the #captain# very well wait a #minute# he went into his cabin and came back with a brace of #pistol#
i #will# blow the brains out of the first #man# who leaves the pump said he well done said the englishman
and during that #time# the wind had abated and the #sea# gone down but the #water# kept rising not much only two inches an #hour# but still it rose
two inches an #hour# does not seem much but in twelve #hour# that makes two #foot# and three we had before that makes five
there #nothing# gives you so much courage as good #reason# continued the #sailor# come said the #captain#
we have done all in our #power# and $m_maximilian_morrel$ #will# have #nothing# to reproach us with we have tried to save the ship let us now save ourselves
you see $m_maximilian_morrel$ a #sailor# is attached to his ship but still more to his #life# so we did not wait to be told twice the more so that the ship was sinking under us and seemed to say get along save yourselves
to the #boat# my lads as quick as you can now continued $penelon$ we soon launched the #boat# and all eight of us got into it
the #captain# descended last or rather he did not descend he would not quit the #vessel# so i took him round the waist and threw him into the #boat# and then i jumped after him
ten #minute# after she pitched forward then the #other# #way# spun round and round and then good bye to the $pharaon$
as for us we were three #day# without #anything# to eat or drink so that we began to think of #drawing# lots who should feed the #rest# when we saw la gironde we made signals of distress she perceived us made for us and took us all on #board#
there now $m_maximilian_morrel$ that the whole #truth# on the #honor# of a #sailor# is not it true you #fellow# there
it was #time# for just as i jumped the deck burst with a #noise# like the broadside of a #man# of war
a general murmur of approbation showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed their #misfortune# and sufferings well well said $m_maximilian_morrel$
i know there was no #one# in fault but destiny it was the #will# of god that this should happen blessed be his #name#
what wages are due to you oh dont let us talk of that $m_maximilian_morrel$ yes but we #will# talk of it
well then three #month# said $penelon$ $cocles$ pay two hundred #franc# to each of these good #fellow# said $m_maximilian_morrel$
i should have said give them besides two hundred #franc# over as a present but #time# are changed and the little #money# that remains to me is not my own so do not think me #mean# on this #account#
at another #time# added he $penelon$ turned to his #companion# and exchanged a few #word# with them
as for that $m_maximilian_morrel$ said he again turning his quid as for that as for what the #money#
well we all say that fifty #franc# #will# be enough for us at present and that we #will# wait for the #rest#
well #thank# my #friend# #thank# cried $m_maximilian_morrel$ gratefully take it take it and if you can find another employer enter his #service# you are free to do so
these last #word# produced a prodigious #effect# on the seaman $penelon$ nearly swallowed his quid fortunately he recovered what $m_maximilian_morrel$ said he in a low #voice#
i am not angry quite the #contrary# and i do not send you away but i have no more ships and therefore i do not want any #sailor#
you send us away you are then angry with us no no said $m_maximilian_morrel$ no more ships
returned $penelon$ well then you ll build some we ll wait for you i have no #money# to build ships with $penelon$ said the poor owner mournfully
so i cannot accept your kind offer no more #money# then you must not pay us we can scud like the $pharaon$ under bare poles
enough enough cried $m_maximilian_morrel$ almost overpowered leave me i pray you we shall meet again in a happier #time#
$m_emmanuel$ go with them and see that my #order# are executed at least we shall see each #other# again $m_maximilian_morrel$ asked $penelon$
yes i #hope# so at least now go he made a #sign# to $cocles$ who went first the seamen followed him and $m_emmanuel$ brought up the rear
now said the owner to his #wife# and #daughter# leave me i #wish# to speak with this #gentleman# m
and he glanced towards the clerk of $thomson_french_of_rome$ who had remained motionless in the #corner# during this #scene# in which he had taken no #part# except the few #word# we have mentioned
the two #woman# looked at this #person# whose #presence# they had entirely forgotten and retired but as she left the #apartment# $mademoiselle_julie$ gave the #stranger# a supplicating #glance# to which he replied by a #smile# that an indifferent spectator would have been surprised to see on his stern #feature#
the two #man# were left alone well #sir# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ sinking into a #chair# you have heard all and i have #nothing# further to tell you
i see returned the englishman that a fresh and unmerited #misfortune# has overwhelmed you and this only increases my #desire# to serve you
oh #sir# cried $m_maximilian_morrel$ let me see continued the #stranger# i am #one# of your largest creditors
your bills at least are the first that #will# fall due do you #wish# for #time# to pay
a delay would save my #honor# and consequently my #life# how long a delay do you #wish# for
$m_maximilian_morrel$ reflected two #month# said he i #will# give you three replied the #stranger# but asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ #will# the $house_of_peers$ of $thomson_french_of_rome$ consent
well renew these bills up to the th of september and on the th of september at eleven clock the #hand# of the clock pointed to eleven i shall come to receive the #money#
oh i take #everything# on myself #today# is the th of june yes i shall expect you returned $m_maximilian_morrel$
and i #will# pay you or i shall be dead these last #word# were uttered in so low a #tone# that the #stranger# could not hear them
the bills were renewed the old #one# destroyed and the poor ship owner found himself with three #month# before him to collect his resources
the englishman received his #thank# with the phlegm peculiar to his nation and $m_maximilian_morrel$ overwhelming him with grateful blessings conducted him to the #staircase#
the #stranger# met $mademoiselle_julie$ on the stairs she pretended to be descending but in reality she was waiting for him
oh #sir# said she clasping her #hand# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said the #stranger# #one# #day# you #will# receive a #letter# signed sinbad the #sailor#
do exactly what the #letter# bids you however strange it may appear yes #sir# returned $mademoiselle_julie$ do you #promise#
continue to be the good sweet #girl# you are at present and i have great #hope# that heaven #will# reward you by giving you $m_emmanuel$ for a #husband#
i swear to you i #will# it is well adieu $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_julie$ uttered a faint #cry# blushed like a rose and leaned against the baluster
in the #court# he found $penelon$ who with a rouleau of a hundred #franc# in either #hand# seemed unable to make up his #mind# to retain them
the #stranger# waved his #hand# and continued to descend come with me my #friend# said the englishman i #wish# to speak to you
the extension provided for by the agent of $thomson_french_of_rome$ at the #moment# when $m_maximilian_morrel$ expected it least was to the poor shipowner so decided a stroke of good #fortune# that he almost dared to believe that fate was at #length# grown weary of wasting her #spite# upon him
the same #day# he told his #wife# $m_emmanuel$ and his #daughter# all that had occurred and a ray of #hope# if not of tranquillity returned to the #family#
unfortunately however $m_maximilian_morrel$ had not only engagements with the $house_of_peers$ of $thomson_french_of_rome$ who had shown themselves so considerate towards him and as he had said in #business# he had correspondents and not #friend#
when he #thought# the #matter# over he could by no #mean# #account# for this generous conduct on the #part# of $thomson_french_of_rome$ towards him and could only attribute it to some such selfish argument as this
we had better help a #man# who owes us nearly #franc# and have those #franc# at the #end# of three #month# than hasten his ruin and get only six or eight per cent of our #money# back again
unfortunately whether through envy or stupidity all $m_maximilian_morrel$ correspondents did not take this view and some even came to a #contrary# decision
the bills signed by $m_maximilian_morrel$ were presented at his office with scrupulous exactitude and #thank# to the delay granted by the englishman were paid by $cocles$ with equal punctuality
it was $m_maximilian_morrel$ alone who remembered with alarm that if he had to repay on the th the #franc# of $m_de_boville$ and on the th the #franc# of bills for which as well as the debt due to the #inspector# of #prison# he had #time# granted he must be a ruined #man#
the #opinion# of all the commercial #man# was that under the reverses which had successively weighed down $m_maximilian_morrel$ it was impossible for him to remain solvent
great therefore was the #astonishment# when at the #end# of the #month# he cancelled all his obligations with his usual punctuality
still confidence was not restored to all #mind# and the general #opinion# was that the complete ruin of the unfortunate shipowner had been postponed only until the #end# of the #month#
#chapter# the fifth of september $cocles$ thus remained in his accustomed tranquillity the #month# passed and $m_maximilian_morrel$ made extraordinary #effort# to get in all his resources
formerly his #paper# at any date was taken with confidence and was even in request $m_maximilian_morrel$ now tried to negotiate bills at ninety #day# only and none of the banks would give him credit
fortunately $m_maximilian_morrel$ had some funds coming in on which he could rely and as they reached him he found himself in a condition to meet his engagements when the #end# of july came
the agent of $thomson_french_of_rome$ had not been again seen at marseilles the #day# after or two #day# after his #visit# to $m_maximilian_morrel$ he had disappeared and as in that city he had had no intercourse but with the mayor the #inspector# of #prison# and $m_maximilian_morrel$ his departure left no trace except in the memories of these three #person#
as to the #sailor# of the $pharaon$ they must have found snug berths elsewhere for they also had disappeared #captain# gaumard recovered from his illness had returned from palma
he delayed presenting himself at $m_maximilian_morrel$ but the owner hearing of his arrival went to see him the worthy shipowner knew from $penelon$ recital of the #captain# brave conduct during the storm and tried to console him
he brought him also the amount of his wages which #captain# gaumard had not dared to apply for as he descended the #staircase# $m_maximilian_morrel$ met $penelon$ who was going up
when he saw his employer the worthy tar seemed much embarrassed drew on #one# #side# into the #corner# of the landing #place# passed his quid from #one# cheek to the #other# stared stupidly with his great #eye# and only acknowledged the squeeze of the #hand# which $m_maximilian_morrel$ as usual gave him by a slight pressure in #return#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ attributed $penelon$ embarrassment to the elegance of his attire it was evident the good #fellow# had not gone to such an expense on his own #account# he was no #doubt# engaged on #board# some #other# #vessel# and thus his bashfulness arose from the #fact# of his not having if we may so express ourselves worn mourning for the $pharaon$ longer
perhaps he had come to tell #captain# gaumard of his good luck and to offer him employment from his new #master#
said $m_maximilian_morrel$ as he went away may your new #master# #love# you as i loved you and be more fortunate than i have been august rolled by in unceasing #effort# on the #part# of $m_maximilian_morrel$ to renew his credit or revive the old
on the th of august it was known at marseilles that he had left town in the mailcoach and then it was said that the bills would go to protest at the #end# of the #month# and that $m_maximilian_morrel$ had gone away and left his chief clerk $m_emmanuel$ and his cashier $cocles$ to meet the creditors
but #contrary# to all expectation when the st of august came the $house_of_peers$ opened as usual and $cocles$ appeared behind the grating of the counter examined all bills presented with the usual scrutiny and from first to last paid all with the usual precision
there came in moreover two drafts which $m_maximilian_morrel$ had fully anticipated and which $cocles$ paid as punctually as the bills which the shipowner had accepted
all this was incomprehensible and then with the tenacity peculiar to prophets of bad news the failure was put off until the #end# of september
on the st $m_maximilian_morrel$ returned he was awaited by his #family# with extreme anxiety for from this journey to paris they hoped great #thing#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ had #thought# of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who was now immensely rich and had lain under great obligations to $m_maximilian_morrel$ in former #day# since to him it was owing that $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ entered the #service# of the spanish #banker# with whom he had laid the foundations of his vast wealth
it was said at this #moment# that $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was worth from six to eight #million# of #franc# and had unlimited credit
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ then without taking a crown from his #pocket# could save $m_maximilian_morrel$ he had but to pass his #word# for a loan and $m_maximilian_morrel$ was saved
$m_maximilian_morrel$ had long #thought# of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ but had kept away from some instinctive motive and had delayed as long as possible availing himself of this last resource
$penelon$ had it would seem made good #use# of his #money# for he was newly clad worthy #fellow# and $m_maximilian_morrel$ was #right# for he returned home crushed by the humiliation of a refusal
he embraced his weeping #wife# and #daughter# pressed $m_emmanuel$ #hand# with friendly warmth and then going to his private #room# on the second #floor# had sent for $cocles$
yet on his arrival $m_maximilian_morrel$ did not utter a complaint or say #one# harsh #word# then said the two #woman# to $m_emmanuel$ we are indeed ruined
it was agreed in a brief council held among them that $mademoiselle_julie$ should write to her #brother# who was in garrison at nîmes to come to them as speedily as possible
the poor #woman# felt instinctively that they required all their #strength# to support the blow that impended besides $m_maximilian_morrel$ though hardly two and twenty had great influence over his #father#
at the #time# when he decided on his profession his #father# had no #desire# to choose for him but had consulted young $m_maximilian_morrel$ taste
he had at once declared for a military #life# and had in consequence studied hard passed brilliantly through the polytechnic school and left it as sub lieutenant of the rd of the #line#
he was a strong minded upright young #man# for a #year# he had held this rank and expected promotion on the first vacancy
in his regiment $m_maximilian_morrel$ was noted for his rigid observance not only of the obligations imposed on a #soldier# but also of the #duty# of a #man# and he thus gained the #name# of the stoic
we need hardly say that many of those who gave him this epithet repeated it because they had heard it and did not even know what it meant
this was the young #man# whom his #mother# and sister called to their aid to sustain them under the serious trial which they felt they would soon have to endure
they had not mistaken the gravity of this #event# for the #moment# after $m_maximilian_morrel$ had entered his private office with $cocles$ $mademoiselle_julie$ saw the latter leave it pale trembling and his #feature# betraying the utmost consternation
she would have questioned him as he passed by her but the worthy creature hastened down the #staircase# with unusual precipitation and only raised his #hand# to heaven and exclaimed
a #moment# afterwards $mademoiselle_julie$ saw him go upstairs carrying two or three heavy ledgers a portfolio and a bag of #money#
oh $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ what a dreadful #misfortune# who could ever have believed it $m_maximilian_morrel$ examined the ledgers opened the portfolio and counted the #money#
all his funds amounted to or #franc# his bills receivable up to the th to or which making the best of #everything# gave him #franc# to meet debts amounting to #franc#
he had not even the #mean# for making a possible settlement on #account# however when $m_maximilian_morrel$ went down to his #dinner# he appeared very calm
after #dinner# $m_maximilian_morrel$ usually went out and used to take his coffee at the club of the phocéens and read the semaphore this #day# he did not leave the $house_of_peers$ but returned to his office
this calmness was more alarming to the two #woman# than the deepest dejection would have been as to $cocles$ he seemed completely bewildered
for #part# of the #day# he went into the courtyard seated himself on a #stone# with his #head# bare and exposed to the blazing sun
the young #man# was too well acquainted with the #business# of the $house_of_peers$ not to feel that a great catastrophe hung over the $m_maximilian_morrel$ #family#
#night# came the two #woman# had watched hoping that when he left his #room# $m_maximilian_morrel$ would come to them but they heard him pass before their #door# and trying to conceal the #noise# of his footsteps
$m_emmanuel$ tried to comfort the #woman# but his eloquence faltered they listened he went into his sleeping #room# and fastened the #door# inside
#madame# $m_maximilian_morrel$ sent her #daughter# to #bed# and #half# an #hour# after $mademoiselle_julie$ had retired she rose took off her shoes and went stealthily along the passage to see through the keyhole what her #husband# was doing
in the passage she saw a retreating #shadow# it was $mademoiselle_julie$ who uneasy herself had anticipated her #mother# the young #lady# went towards #madame# $m_maximilian_morrel$
#madame# $m_maximilian_morrel$ looked again through the keyhole $m_maximilian_morrel$ was writing but #madame# $m_maximilian_morrel$ remarked what her #daughter# had not observed that her #husband# was writing on stamped #paper#
the terrible #idea# that he was writing his #will# flashed across her she shuddered and yet had not #strength# to utter a #word#
next #day# $m_maximilian_morrel$ seemed as calm as ever went into his office as usual came to his breakfast punctually and then after #dinner# he placed his #daughter# beside him took her #head# in his #arm# and held her for a long #time# against his bosom
in the #evening# $mademoiselle_julie$ told her #mother# that although he was apparently so calm she had noticed that her #father# #heart# beat violently
he is writing she said they had understood each #other# without speaking the next two #day# passed in much the same #way#
on the #evening# of the th of september $m_maximilian_morrel$ asked his #daughter# for the key of his #study# $mademoiselle_julie$ trembled at this request which seemed to her of bad omen
why did her #father# ask for this key which she always kept and which was only taken from her in childhood as a punishment
the young #girl# looked at $m_maximilian_morrel$ what have i done wrong #father# she said that you should take this key from me
#nothing# my dear replied the unhappy #man# the #tear# starting to his #eye# at this simple #question# #nothing# only i want it
$mademoiselle_julie$ made a pretence to feel for the key i must have left it in my #room# she said
do not give this key to your #father# said he and #tomorrow# #morning# if possible do not quit him for a #moment#
and she went out but instead of going to her #apartment# she hastened to consult $m_emmanuel$ she questioned $m_emmanuel$ but he knew #nothing# or would not say what he knew
during the #night# between the th and th of september #madame# $m_maximilian_morrel$ remained listening for every #sound# and until three clock in the #morning# she heard her #husband# pacing the #room# in great agitation
it was three clock when he threw himself on the #bed# the #mother# and #daughter# passed the #night# together they had expected $m_maximilian_morrel$ since the previous #evening#
at eight clock in the #morning# $m_maximilian_morrel$ entered their #chamber# he was calm but the agitation of the #night# was legible in his pale and careworn visage
they did not dare to ask him how he had slept $m_maximilian_morrel$ was kinder to his #wife# more affectionate to his #daughter# than he had ever been
$mademoiselle_julie$ mindful of $m_emmanuel$ request was following her #father# when he quitted the #room# but he said to her quickly
he could not cease gazing at and kissing the sweet #girl# remain with your #mother# dearest $mademoiselle_julie$ wished to accompany him
this was the first #time# $m_maximilian_morrel$ had ever so spoken but he said it in a #tone# of paternal kindness and $mademoiselle_julie$ did not dare to disobey
i #wish# you to do so said he she remained at the same #spot# standing mute and motionless an #instant# afterwards the #door# opened she felt two #arm# encircle her and a mouth pressed her #forehead#
she looked up and uttered an exclamation of #joy# $m_maximilian_morrel$ my dearest #brother# she cried at these #word# #madame# $m_maximilian_morrel$ rose and threw herself into her #son# #arm#
#mother# said the young #man# looking alternately at #madame# $m_maximilian_morrel$ and her #daughter# what has occurred what has happened your #letter# has frightened me and i have come hither with all speed
$mademoiselle_julie$ said #madame# $m_maximilian_morrel$ making a #sign# to the young #man# go and tell your #father# that $m_maximilian_morrel$ has just arrived
the young #lady# rushed out of the #apartment# but on the first #step# of the #staircase# she found a #man# holding a #letter# in his #hand#
are you not $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_julie$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ inquired the #man# with a strong italian accent yes #sir# replied $mademoiselle_julie$ with hesitation
what is your #pleasure# i do not know you read this #letter# he said handing it to her
$mademoiselle_julie$ hesitated it concerns the best #interest# of your #father# said the messenger the young #girl# hastily took the #letter# from him
no ask the porter for the key of the #room# on the fifth #floor# enter the #apartment# take from the #corner# of the mantelpiece a purse netted in red silk and give it to your #father#
she opened it quickly and read go this #moment# to the allées de meilhan enter the $house_of_peers$ it is important that he should receive it before eleven clock
you promised to obey me implicitly remember your oath sinbad the #sailor# the young #girl# uttered a joyful #cry# raised her #eye# looked round to #question# the messenger but he had disappeared
she cast her #eye# again over the #note# to peruse it a second #time# and saw there was a postscript she read
if you go accompanied by any #other# #person# or should #anyone# else go in your #place# the porter #will# reply that he does not know #anything# about it
it is important that you should fulfil this mission in #person# and alone this postscript decreased greatly the young #girl#
#happiness# was there #nothing# to #fear# was there not some snare laid for her her innocence had kept her in ignorance of the dangers that might assail a young #girl# of her #age#
but there is no need to know danger in #order# to #fear# it indeed it may be observed that it is usually unknown perils that inspire the greatest #terror#
$mademoiselle_julie$ hesitated and resolved to take counsel yet through a singular impulse it was neither to her #mother# nor her #brother# that she applied but to $m_emmanuel$
she hastened down and told him what had occurred on the #day# when the agent of $thomson_french_of_rome$ had come to her #father# related the #scene# on the #staircase# repeated the #promise# she had made and showed him the #letter#
you must go then $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said $m_emmanuel$ go there murmured $mademoiselle_julie$ yes i #will# accompany you
but did you not read that i must be alone said $mademoiselle_julie$ and you shall be alone replied the young #man#
i #will# await you at the #corner# of the rue du musée and if you are so long absent as to make me uneasy i #will# hasten to rejoin you and woe to him of whom you shall have cause to complain to me
then $m_emmanuel$ said the young #girl# with hesitation it is your #opinion# that i should obey this invitation
yes did not the messenger say your #father# safety depended upon it but what danger threatens him then $m_emmanuel$ she asked
$m_emmanuel$ hesitated a #moment# but his #desire# to make $mademoiselle_julie$ decide immediately made him reply listen he said #today# is the th of september is it not
yes #today# then at eleven clock your #father# has nearly three hundred thousand #franc# to pay yes we know that
well then continued $m_emmanuel$ we have not fifteen thousand #franc# in the $house_of_peers$ what #will# happen then
why if #today# before eleven clock your #father# has not found someone who #will# come to his aid he #will# be compelled at twelve clock to declare himself a bankrupt
oh come then come cried she hastening away with the young #man# during this #time# #madame# $m_maximilian_morrel$ had told her #son# #everything#
the young #man# knew quite well that after the succession of #misfortune# which had befallen his #father# great changes had taken #place# in the style of living and housekeeping but he did not know that #matter# had reached such a #point#
then rushing hastily out of the #apartment# he ran upstairs expecting to find his #father# in his #study# but he rapped there in vain
while he was yet at the #door# of the #study# he heard the bedroom #door# open turned and saw his #father#
instead of going direct to his #study# $m_maximilian_morrel$ had returned to his bedchamber which he was only this #moment# quitting
he was thunderstruck $m_maximilian_morrel$ uttered a #cry# of surprise at the #sight# of his #son# of whose arrival he was ignorant
he remained motionless on the #spot# pressing with his left #hand# #something# he had concealed under his coat $m_maximilian_morrel$ sprang down the #staircase# and threw his #arm# round his #father#
#father# he exclaimed turning pale as #death# what are you going to do with that brace of #pistol# under your coat
neck but suddenly he recoiled and placed his #right# #hand# on $m_maximilian_morrel$ breast oh this is what i feared said $m_maximilian_morrel$
#father# father in heaven #name# exclaimed the young #man# what are these weapons for $m_maximilian_morrel$ replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ looking fixedly at his #son# you are a #man# and a #man# of #honor#
come and i #will# explain to you and with a firm #step# $m_maximilian_morrel$ went up to his #study# while $m_maximilian_morrel$ followed him trembling as he went
$m_maximilian_morrel$ opened the #door# and closed it behind his #son# then crossing the anteroom went to his desk on which he placed the #pistol# and pointed with his #finger# to an open ledger
in this ledger was made out an exact balance sheet of his #affair# $m_maximilian_morrel$ had to pay within #half# an #hour# #franc#
all he possessed was #franc# read said $m_maximilian_morrel$ the young #man# was overwhelmed as he read $m_maximilian_morrel$ said not a #word#
what could he say what need he add to such a desperate #proof# in figures and have you done all that is possible #father# to meet this disastrous result
asked the young #man# after a #moment# pause i have replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ you have no #money# coming in on which you can rely
none you have exhausted every resource all and in #half# an #hour# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ in a gloomy #voice# our #name# is dishonored
#blood# washes out dishonor said $m_maximilian_morrel$ you are #right# #father# i understand you then extending his #hand# towards #one# of the #pistol# he said
there is #one# for you and #one# for me #thank# $m_maximilian_morrel$ caught his #hand# your #mother# your sister who #will# support them
a shudder ran through the young #man# frame #father# he said do you reflect that you are bidding me to live
yes i do so bid you answered $m_maximilian_morrel$ it is your #duty# you have a calm strong #mind# $m_maximilian_morrel$
i make no requests or commands i only ask you to examine my #position# as if it were your own and then judge for yourself
the young #man# reflected for a #moment# then an #expression# of sublime resignation appeared in his #eye# and with a slow and sad gesture he took off his two epaulets the insignia of his rank
be it so then my #father# he said extending his #hand# to $m_maximilian_morrel$ die in peace my #father# i #will# live
$m_maximilian_morrel$ was about to cast himself on his knees before his #son# but $m_maximilian_morrel$ caught him in his #arm# and those two noble #heart# were pressed against each #other# for a #moment#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ you are no ordinary #man# you know it is not my fault said $m_maximilian_morrel$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ smiled
i know #father# you are the most honorable #man# i have ever known good my #son# and now there is no more to be said go and rejoin your #mother# and sister
$m_maximilian_morrel$ took the #head# of his #son# between his two #hand# drew him forward and kissing his #forehead# several #time# said
oh yes yes i bless you in my own #name# and in the #name# of three generations of irreproachable #man# who say through me
my #father# said the young #man# bending his knee bless me the edifice which #misfortune# has destroyed providence may build up again
on seeing me die such a #death# the most inexorable #will# have #pity# on you to you perhaps they #will# accord the #time# they have refused to me
go to #work# labor young #man# struggle ardently and courageously live yourself your #mother# and sister with the most rigid economy so that from #day# to #day# the property of those whom i leave in your #hand# may augment and fructify
reflect how glorious a #day# it #will# be how grand how solemn that #day# of complete restoration on which you #will# say in this very office
my #father# died because he could not do what i have this #day# done but he died calmly and peaceably because in dying he knew what i should do
then do your best to keep our #name# free from dishonor my #father# my #father# cried the young #man# why should you not live
if i live all would be changed if i live #interest# would be converted into #doubt# #pity# into hostility if i live i am only a #man# who has broken his #word# failed in his engagements
in #fact# only a bankrupt if on the #contrary# i die remember $m_maximilian_morrel$ my corpse is that of an honest but unfortunate #man#
living you would feel shame at my #name# dead you may raise your #head# and say i am the #son# of him you killed because for the first #time# he has been compelled to break his #word#
living my best #friend# would avoid my $house_of_peers$ dead all marseilles #will# follow me in #tear# to my last home
the young #man# uttered a groan but appeared resigned and now said $m_maximilian_morrel$ leave me alone and endeavor to keep your #mother# and sister away
a last but final #hope# was concealed by the young #man# in the #effect# of this interview and therefore he had suggested it
#will# you not see my sister once more asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ shook his #head# i saw her this #morning# and bade her adieu
have you no particular commands to leave with me my #father# inquired $m_maximilian_morrel$ in a faltering #voice# yes my #son# and a sacred command
say it my #father# the $house_of_peers$ of $thomson_french_of_rome$ is the only #one# who from humanity or it may be selfishness
its agent who #will# in ten #minute# present himself to receive the amount of a bill of #franc# i #will# not say granted but offered me three #month#
it is not for me to read #man# #heart# has had any #pity# for me let this $house_of_peers$ be the first repaid my #son# and respect this #man#
#father# i #will# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ and now once more adieu said $m_maximilian_morrel$ go leave me i would be alone
you #will# find my #will# in the secretaire in my bedroom the young #man# remained standing and motionless having but the force of #will# and not the #power# of execution
suppose i were a #soldier# like you and ordered to carry a certain redoubt and you knew i must be killed in the assault would you not say to me as you said just now go #father#
hear me $m_maximilian_morrel$ said his #father# for you are dishonored by delay and #death# is preferable to shame
yes yes said the young #man# yes and once again embracing his #father# with convulsive pressure he said
when his #son# had left him $m_maximilian_morrel$ remained an #instant# standing with his #eye# fixed on the #door# then putting forth his #arm# he pulled the bell
be it so my #father# and he rushed out of the #study# after a #moment# interval $cocles$ appeared it was no longer the same #man# the fearful revelations of the three last #day# had crushed him
this #thought# the $house_of_peers$ of $m_maximilian_morrel$ is about to stop payment bent him to the #earth# more than twenty #year# would otherwise have done
my worthy $cocles$ said $m_maximilian_morrel$ in a #tone# impossible to describe do you remain in the antechamber when the #gentleman# who came three #month# ago the agent of $thomson_french_of_rome$ arrives announce his arrival to me
$cocles$ made no reply he made a #sign# with his #head# went into the anteroom and seated himself $m_maximilian_morrel$ fell back in his #chair# his #eye# fixed on the clock there were seven #minute# left that was all
the #hand# moved on with incredible rapidity he seemed to see its motion what passed in the #mind# of this #man# at the supreme #moment# of his agony cannot be told in #word#
he was still comparatively young he was surrounded by the loving #care# of a devoted #family# but he had convinced himself by a #course# of reasoning illogical perhaps yet certainly plausible that he must separate himself from all he held dear in the #world# even #life# itself
to form the slightest #idea# of his #feeling# #one# must have seen his #face# with its #expression# of enforced resignation and its #tear# moistened #eye# raised to heaven
the #minute# #hand# moved on the #pistol# were loaded he stretched forth his #hand# took #one# up and murmured his #daughter# #name#
then he laid it down seized his pen and wrote a few #word# it seemed to him as if he had not taken a sufficient farewell of his beloved #daughter#
he took up the deadly weapon again his #lip# parted and his #eye# fixed on the clock and then shuddered at the click of the trigger as he cocked the #pistol#
at this #moment# of mortal anguish the cold sweat came forth upon his #brow# a pang stronger than #death# clutched at his #heart# strings
then he turned again to the clock counting #time# now not by #minute# but by seconds he heard the #door# of the #staircase# creak on its hinges
the clock gave its warning to strike eleven the #door# of his #study# opened $m_maximilian_morrel$ did not #turn# round he expected these #word# of $cocles$
the agent of $thomson_french_of_rome$ he placed the muzzle of the #pistol# between his teeth suddenly he heard a #cry#
it was his #daughter# #voice# he turned and saw $mademoiselle_julie$ the #pistol# fell from his #hand# my #father# cried the young #girl# out of breath and #half# dead with #joy# saved you are saved
and she threw herself into his #arm# holding in her extended #hand# a red netted silk purse saved my #child#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ took the purse and started as he did so for a vague remembrance reminded him that it once belonged to himself
at #one# #end# was the receipted bill for the #franc# and at the #other# was a #diamond# as large as a hazel nut with these #word# on a small slip of parchment $mademoiselle_julie$ dowry
said $m_maximilian_morrel$ what do you #mean# yes saved saved see see said the young #girl# $m_maximilian_morrel$ passed his #hand# over his #brow# it seemed to him a #dream#
at this #moment# the clock struck eleven he felt as if each stroke of the hammer fell upon his #heart#
in a $house_of_peers$ in the allées de meilhan no on the #corner# of a mantelpiece in a small #room# on the fifth #floor#
explain my #child# he said explain my #child# he said explain where did you find this purse but cried $m_maximilian_morrel$
this purse is not yours $mademoiselle_julie$ handed to her #father# the #letter# she had received in the #morning# and did you go alone
he was to have waited for me at the #corner# of the rue du musée but strange to say he was not there when i returned
asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ after he had read it $m_emmanuel$ accompanied me #father# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ exclaimed a #voice# on the stairs
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ it is his #voice# said $mademoiselle_julie$ at this #moment# $m_emmanuel$ entered his #countenance# full of animation and #joy#
the $pharaon$ he cried the $pharaon$ what what the $pharaon$ are you mad $m_emmanuel$ you know the #vessel# is lost
$m_maximilian_morrel$ fell back in his #chair# his #strength# was failing him his understanding weakened by such #event# refused to comprehend such incredible unheard of fabulous #fact#
the $pharaon$ #sir# they signal the $pharaon$ the $pharaon$ is entering the harbor but his #son# came in
#father# cried $m_maximilian_morrel$ how could you say the $pharaon$ was lost the lookout has signalled her and they say she is now coming into port
my dear #friend# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ if this be so it must be a miracle of heaven impossible impossible
but what was real and not less incredible was the purse he held in his #hand# the acceptance receipted the splendid #diamond#
come dear #one# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ rising from his #seat# let us go and see and heaven have #pity# upon us if it be false intelligence
they all went out and on the stairs met #madame# $m_maximilian_morrel$ who had been afraid to go up into the #study#
ah #sir# exclaimed $cocles$ what can it #mean# the $pharaon$ in a #moment# they were at the canebière
there was a crowd on the pier all the crowd gave #way# before $m_maximilian_morrel$ the $pharaon$ the $pharaon$ said every #voice#
and wonderful to see in front of the tower of saint jean was a ship bearing on her stern these #word# printed in white #letter#
the $pharaon$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ #son# of marseilles she was the exact duplicate of the #other# $pharaon$ and loaded as that had been with cochineal and indigo
she cast anchor clued up sails and on the deck was #captain# gaumard giving #order# and good old $penelon$ making signals to $m_maximilian_morrel$
to #doubt# any longer was impossible there was the evidence of the senses and ten thousand #person# who came to corroborate the testimony
as $m_maximilian_morrel$ and his #son# embraced on the pier #head# in the #presence# and amid the applause of the whole city witnessing this #event# a #man# with his #face# #half# covered by a black beard and who concealed behind the sentry #box# watched the #scene# with delight uttered these #word# in a low #tone#
be happy noble #heart# be blessed for all the good thou hast done and wilt do hereafter and let my gratitude remain in obscurity like your good deeds m
and with a #smile# expressive of supreme content he left his hiding #place# and without being observed descended #one# of the flights of #step# provided for debarkation and hailing three #time# shouted $jacopo_manfredi$ jacopo $jacopo_manfredi$
then a launch came to shore took him on #board# and conveyed him to a yacht splendidly fitted up on whose deck he sprung with the activity of a #sailor# thence he once again looked towards $m_maximilian_morrel$ who weeping with #joy# was shaking #hand# most cordially with all the crowd around him and thanking with a #look# the unknown benefactor whom he seemed to be seeking in the skies
and now said the unknown farewell kindness humanity and gratitude farewell to all the #feeling# that expand the #heart# i have been heaven substitute to recompense the good
at these #word# he gave a signal and as if only awaiting this signal the yacht instantly put out to #sea#
sinbad the #sailor# towards the beginning of the #year# two young #man# belonging to the first society of paris the viscount $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and the #baron# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay were at florence
they had agreed to see the carnival at rome that #year# and that $m_franz_de_quesnel$ who for the last three or four #year# had inhabited italy should act as cicerone to $m_albert_de_morcerf$
as it is no inconsiderable #affair# to spend the carnival at rome especially when you have no great #desire# to sleep on the piazza del popolo or the campo vaccino they wrote to $signor_pastrini$ the proprietor of the hôtel de londres piazza di spagna to reserve comfortable #apartment# for them
$signor_pastrini$ replied that he had only two #room# and a parlor on the third #floor# which he offered at the low charge of a $louis_xviii$ per diem
they accepted his offer but wishing to make the best #use# of the #time# that was left $m_albert_de_morcerf$ started for naples
as for $m_franz_de_quesnel$ he remained at florence and after having passed a few #day# in exploring the paradise of the cascine and spending two or three #evening# at the #house# of the florentine nobility he took a fancy into his #head# having already visited corsica the cradle of $bonaparte$ to #visit# $elba$ the waiting #place# of $napoleon$
#one# #evening# he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the #iron# ring that secured it to the dock at leghorn wrapped himself in his coat and lay down and said to the crew to the #island# of $elba$
now the god of vengeance yields to me his #power# to punish the wicked #chapter# italy the #boat# shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next #morning# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ disembarked at porto ferrajo
he traversed the #island# after having followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left and re embarked for marciana
the sport was bad $m_franz_de_quesnel$ only succeeded in killing a few partridges and like every unsuccessful sportsman he returned to the #boat# very much out of temper
two #hour# after he again landed at pianosa where he was assured that red partridges abounded ah if your #excellency# chose said the #captain# you might have capital sport
where do you see that #island# continued the #captain# pointing to a conical pile rising from the indigo #sea#
well what is this #island# the #island# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ but i have no permission to shoot over this #island#
your #excellency# does not require a permit for the #island# is uninhabited ah indeed said the young #man#
it is very natural this #island# is a mass of #rock# and does not contain an acre of land capable of cultivation
a desert #island# in the midst of the mediterranean must be a curiosity to whom does this #island# belong
to tuscany what game shall i find there thousands of wild goats who live upon the #stone# i suppose said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ with an incredulous #smile#
no but by browsing the shrubs and #tree# that grow out of the crevices of the #rock# where can i sleep
on shore in the grottos or on #board# in your cloak besides if your #excellency# pleases we can leave as soon as you like
we can sail as well by #night# as by #day# and if the wind drops we can #use# our oars
as $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had sufficient #time# and his #apartment# at rome were not yet available he accepted the proposition upon his #answer# in the affirmative the #sailor# exchanged a few #word# together in a low #tone#
well asked he what now is there any difficulty in the #way# no replied the #captain# but we must warn your #excellency# that the #island# is an infected port
$m_de_monte_cristo$ although uninhabited yet serves occasionally as a refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from corsica sardinia and africa and if it becomes known that we have been there we shall have to perform quarantine for six #day# on our #return# to leghorn
what do you #mean# the deuce that puts a different #face# on the #matter# six #day#
why that as long as the almighty took to make the #world# too long a wait too long but who #will# say your #excellency# has been to $m_de_monte_cristo$
oh i shall not cried $m_franz_de_quesnel$ nor i nor i chorused the #sailor# then steer for $m_de_monte_cristo$
the #captain# gave his #order# the helm was put up and the #boat# was soon sailing in the direction of the #island#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ waited until all was in #order# and when the sail was filled and the four #sailor# had taken their #place# three forward and #one# at the helm
you tell me $m_de_monte_cristo$ serves as a refuge for pirates who are it seems to me a very different kind of game from the goats
he resumed the #conversation# $gaetano$ said he to the #captain# yes your #excellency# and it is true
i knew there were smugglers but i #thought# that since the capture of algiers and the destruction of the regency pirates existed only in the romances of cooper and #captain# marryat
your #excellency# is mistaken there are pirates like the #bandit# who were believed to have been exterminated by pope leo xii
has not your #excellency# heard that the french chargé affaires was robbed six #month# ago within five hundred paces of velletri
and who yet every #day# rob #traveller# at the #gate# of rome oh yes i heard that
well then if like us your #excellency# lived at leghorn you would hear from #time# to #time# that a little merchant #vessel# or an english yacht that was expected at bastia at porto ferrajo or at civita vecchia has not arrived no #one# knows what has become of it but doubtless it has struck on a #rock# and foundered
now this #rock# it has met has been a long and narrow #boat# manned by six or eight #man# who have surprised and plundered it some dark and stormy #night# near some desert and gloomy #island# as #bandit# plunder a #carriage# in the recesses of a forest
but asked $m_franz_de_quesnel$ who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom of the #boat# why do not those who have been plundered complain to the french sardinian or tuscan governments
because in the first #place# they transfer from the #vessel# to their own #boat# whatever they think worth taking then they bind the crew #hand# and #foot# they attach to #everyone#
why said $gaetano$ with a #smile# yes why neck a four and twenty pound ball a large hole is chopped in the #vessel# bottom and then they leave her
at the #end# of ten #minute# the #vessel# begins to roll heavily and settle down first #one# gun goes under then the #other#
then they lift and sink again and both go under at once all at once there a #noise# like a cannon that the #air# blowing up the deck
soon the #water# rushes out of the scupper holes like a whale spouting the #vessel# gives a last groan spins round and round and disappears forming a vast whirlpool in the ocean and then all is over so that in five #minute# #nothing# but the #eye# of god can see the #vessel# where she lies at the bottom of the #sea#
do you understand now said the #captain# why no complaints are made to the government and why the #vessel# never reaches port
it is probable that if $gaetano$ had related this previous to proposing the expedition $m_franz_de_quesnel$ would have hesitated but now that they had started he #thought# it would be cowardly to draw back
he was #one# of those #man# who do not rashly #court# danger but if danger presents itself combat it with the most unalterable coolness
calm and resolute he treated any peril as he would an adversary in a duel calculated its probable method of approach retreated if at all as a #point# of strategy and not from cowardice was quick to see an #opening# for attack and won victory at a single thrust
i have sailed two #month# in the archipelago and yet i never saw even the #shadow# of a #bandit# or a pirate
i did not tell your #excellency# this to deter you from your project replied $gaetano$ but you questioned me and i have answered that all
bah said he i have travelled through sicily and calabria yes and your #conversation# is most interesting and
the wind blew strongly the #boat# made six or seven knots an #hour# and they were rapidly reaching the #end# of their voyage
as they drew near the #island# seemed to lift from the #sea# and the #air# was so clear that they could already distinguish the #rock# heaped on #one# another like cannon balls in an arsenal with green bushes and #tree# growing in the crevices
as for the #sailor# although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing and on which a few fishing #boat# with their white sails were alone visible
they were within fifteen miles of $m_de_monte_cristo$ when the sun began to set behind corsica whose mountains appeared against the sky showing their rugged peaks in bold relief this mass of #rock# like the giant adamastor rose dead ahead a formidable barrier and intercepting the #light# that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in #shadow#
little by little the #shadow# rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the expiring #day# at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain where it paused an #instant# like the fiery crest of a volcano then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base and the #island# now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker #half# an #hour# after the #night# was quite dark
fortunately the mariners were used to these latitudes and knew every #rock# in the tuscan archipelago for in the midst of this obscurity
corsica had long since disappeared and $m_de_monte_cristo$ itself was invisible but the #sailor# seemed like the lynx to see in the dark and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation
an #hour# had passed since the sun had set when $m_franz_de_quesnel$ fancied he saw at a #quarter# of a mile to the left a dark mass but he could not precisely make out what it was and fearing to excite the mirth of the #sailor# by mistaking a floating cloud for land he remained silent suddenly a great #light# appeared on the strand land might resemble a cloud but the #fire# was not a meteor
as i #wish# to enjoy it as long as possible steer for $m_de_monte_cristo$ $m_franz_de_quesnel$ was not without uneasiness
what is this #light# asked he hush said the #captain# it is a #fire# but you told me the #island# was uninhabited
i said there were no fixed habitations on it but i said also that it served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers
it is for that #reason# i have given #order# to pass the #island# for as you see the #fire# is behind us
and for pirates and for pirates returned $gaetano$ repeating $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #word# but this #fire# continued $m_franz_de_quesnel$
it seems to me rather reassuring than otherwise #man# who did not #wish# to be seen would not #light# a #fire#
if you can guess the #position# of the #island# in the #darkness# you #will# see that the #fire# cannot be seen from the #side# or from pianosa but only from the #sea#
oh that goes for #nothing# said $gaetano$ you think then this #fire# indicates the #presence# of unpleasant neighbors
that is what we must find out returned $gaetano$ fixing his #eye# on this terrestrial star how can you find out
$gaetano$ consulted with his #companion# and after five #minute# discussion a manœuvre was executed which caused the #vessel# to tack about they returned the #way# they had come and in a few #minute# the #fire# disappeared hidden by an elevation of the land
the pilot again changed the #course# of the #boat# which rapidly approached the #island# and was soon within fifty paces of it
you shall see $gaetano$ lowered the sail and the #boat# came to #rest# all this was done in #silence# and from the #moment# that their #course# was changed not a #word# was spoken
$gaetano$ who had proposed the expedition had taken all the responsibility on himself the four #sailor# fixed their #eye# on him while they got out their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away which #thank# to the #darkness# would not be difficult
as for $m_franz_de_quesnel$ he examined his #arm# with the utmost coolness he had two double barrelled guns and a rifle he loaded them looked at the priming and waited quietly
during this #time# the #captain# had thrown off his vest and shirt and secured his trousers round his waist his #foot# were naked so he had no shoes and stockings to take off after these preparations he placed his #finger# on his #lip# and lowering himself noiselessly into the #sea# swam towards the shore with such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest #sound# he could only be traced by the phosphorescent #line# in his wake
#everyone# on #board# remained motionless for #half# an #hour# when the same luminous track was again observed and the swimmer was soon on #board#
this track soon disappeared it was evident that he had touched the shore well exclaimed $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and the #sailor# in unison
they are spanish smugglers said he they have with them two corsican #bandit# and what are these corsican #bandit# doing here with spanish smugglers
alas returned the #captain# with an accent of the most profound #pity# we ought always to help #one# another
very often the #bandit# are hard pressed by gendarmes or carbineers well they see a #vessel# and good #fellow# like us on #board# they come and demand hospitality of us you cant refuse help to a poor hunted devil we receive them and for greater security we stand out to #sea#
this costs us #nothing# and saves the #life# or at least the #liberty# of a #fellow# creature who on the first occasion #return# the #service# by pointing out some safe #spot# where we can land our goods without interruption
ah said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ then you are a smuggler occasionally $gaetano$ your #excellency# we must live somehow returned the #other# smiling impenetrably
then you know the #man# who are now on $m_de_monte_cristo$ oh yes we #sailor# are like freemasons and recognize each #other# by #sign#
and do you think we have #nothing# to #fear# if we land #nothing# at all smugglers are not thieves
but these two corsican #bandit# said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ calculating the #chance# of peril it is not their fault that they are #bandit# but that of the authorities
because they are pursued for having made a stiff as if it was not in a corsican #nature# to revenge himself
how so what do you #mean# by having made a stiff having assassinated a #man# said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ continuing his investigation
i #mean# that they have killed an #enemy# which is a very different #thing# returned the #captain# well said the young #man# let us demand hospitality of these smugglers and #bandit#
do you think they #will# grant it without #doubt# how many are they four and the two #bandit# make six
just our number so that if they prove troublesome we shall be able to hold them in check so for the last #time# steer to $m_de_monte_cristo$
by all #mean# be as wise as nestor and as prudent as ulysses i do more than permit i exhort you
yes but your #excellency# #will# permit us to take all due precautions #silence# then said $gaetano$
he was alone in the #darkness# with #sailor# whom he did not know and who had no #reason# to be devoted to him who knew that he had several thousand #franc# in his belt and who had often examined his weapons which
#everyone# obeyed for a #man# who like $m_franz_de_quesnel$ viewed his #position# in its true #light# it was a grave #one# were very beautiful if not with envy at least with curiosity
on the #other# #hand# he was about to land without any #other# escort than these #man# on an #island# which had indeed a very religious #name# but which did not seem to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ likely to afford him much hospitality #thank# to the smugglers and #bandit#
the history of the scuttled #vessel# which had appeared improbable during the #day# seemed very probable at #night# placed as he was between two possible sources of danger he kept his #eye# on the crew and his gun in his #hand#
through the #darkness# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ whose #eye# were now more accustomed to it could see the looming shore along which the #boat# was sailing and then as they rounded a rocky #point# he saw the #fire# more brilliant than ever and about it five or six #person# seated
the #sailor# had again hoisted sail and the #vessel# was once more cleaving the waves the blaze illumined the #sea# for a hundred paces around
$gaetano$ skirted the #light# carefully keeping the #boat# in the #shadow# then when they were opposite the #fire# he steered to the centre of the circle singing a fishing song of which his #companion# sung the chorus
at the first #word# of the song the #man# seated round the #fire# arose and approached the landing #place# their #eye# fixed on the #boat# evidently seeking to know who the new comers were and what were their intentions
they soon appeared satisfied and returned with the exception of #one# who remained at the shore to their #fire# at which the carcass of a goat was roasting
when the #boat# was within twenty paces of the shore the #man# on the beach who carried a carbine presented #arm# after the #manner# of a sentinel and cried
who comes there in sardinian $m_franz_de_quesnel$ coolly cocked both barrels $gaetano$ then exchanged a few #word# with this #man# which the #traveller# did not understand but which evidently concerned him
#will# your #excellency# give your #name# or remain incognito asked the #captain# my #name# must #rest# unknown replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ merely say i am a frenchman travelling for #pleasure#
as soon as $gaetano$ had transmitted this #answer# the sentinel gave an #order# to #one# of the #man# seated round the #fire# who rose and disappeared among the #rock#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ with his disembarkment the #sailor# with their sails the smugglers with their goat but in the midst of all this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each #other#
the #man# who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite #side# to that by which he had left he made a #sign# with his #head# to the sentinel who turning to the #boat# said accommodi
not a #word# was spoken #everyone# seemed occupied the italian accommodi is untranslatable it #mean# at once come enter you are welcome make yourself at home you are the #master#
it is like that turkish phrase of molière that so astonished the bourgeois #gentleman# by the number of #thing# implied in its utterance
the #sailor# did not wait for a second invitation four strokes of the oar brought them to land $gaetano$ sprang to shore exchanged a few #word# with the sentinel then his comrades disembarked and lastly came $m_franz_de_quesnel$
#one# of his guns was swung over his #shoulder# $gaetano$ had the #other# and a #sailor# held his rifle his dress #half# artist #half# dandy did not excite any suspicion and consequently no disquietude
the #boat# was moored to the shore and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable bivouac but doubtless the #spot# they chose did not suit the smuggler who filled the post of sentinel for he cried out
not that #way# if you please $gaetano$ faltered an excuse and advanced to the opposite #side# while two #sailor# kindled torches at the #fire# to #light# them on their #way#
they advanced about thirty paces and then stopped at a small esplanade surrounded with #rock# in which #seat# had been cut not unlike sentry #box#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ lowered a torch and saw by the mass of cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this retreat which was doubtless #one# of the halting #place# of the wandering visitors of $m_de_monte_cristo$
as for his suspicions once on terra firma once that he had seen the indifferent if not friendly #appearance# of his hosts his anxiety had quite disappeared or rather at #sight# of the goat had turned to appetite
he mentioned this to $gaetano$ who replied that #nothing# could be more easy than to prepare a supper when they had in their #boat# bread wine #half# a dozen partridges and a good #fire# to roast them by
besides added he if the smell of their roast meat tempts you i #will# go and offer them two of our birds for a slice
around in the crevices of the #rock# grew a few dwarf oaks and thick bushes of myrtles
you are a born diplomat returned $m_franz_de_quesnel$ go and try meanwhile the #sailor# had collected dried sticks and branches with which they made a #fire#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ waited impatiently inhaling the aroma of the roasted meat when the #captain# returned with a mysterious #air# well said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #anything# new do they refuse
on the #contrary# returned $gaetano$ the chief who was told you were a young frenchman invites you to sup with him
well observed $m_franz_de_quesnel$ this chief is very polite and i see no objection the more so as i bring my share of the supper
he has plenty and to spare for supper but he makes #one# condition and rather a peculiar #one# before he #will# receive you at his $house_of_peers$
oh it is not that his $house_of_peers$ has he built #one# here then no but he has a very comfortable #one# all the same so they say
you know this chief then i have heard talk of him favorably or otherwise
both the deuce and what is this condition that you are blindfolded and do not take off the bandage until he himself bids you
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ looked at $gaetano$ to see if possible what he #thought# of this proposal ah replied he guessing $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #thought#
i know this is a serious #matter# what should you do in my #place# i who have #nothing# to lose i should go
you would accept yes were it only out of curiosity there is #something# very peculiar about this chief then
listen said $gaetano$ lowering his #voice# i do not know if what they say is true he stopped to see if #anyone# was near
what do they say that this chief inhabits a cavern to which the pitti palace is #nothing#
cama the pilot of the saint ferdinand went in once and he came back amazed vowing that such #treasure# were only to be heard of in fairy tales
what nonsense said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ reseating himself it is no nonsense it is quite true do you know observed $m_franz_de_quesnel$ that with such #story# you make me think of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ baba s
enchanted cavern i tell you what i have been told then you advise me to accept
oh i dont say that your #excellency# #will# do as you please i should be sorry to advise you in the #matter#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ pondered the #matter# for a few #moment# concluded that a #man# so rich could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he had and seeing only the prospect of a good supper accepted
he turned towards the #sailor# who during this dialogue had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the #air# of a #man# proud of his office and asked him how these #man# had landed as no #vessel# of any kind was visible
$gaetano$ departed with the reply $m_franz_de_quesnel$ was prudent and wished to learn all he possibly could concerning his host
never #mind# that returned the #sailor# i know their #vessel# is it a very beautiful #vessel# i would not #wish# for a better to sail round the #world#
of what burden is she about a hundred tons but she is built to stand any weather she is what the english call a yacht
where was she built i know not but my own #opinion# is she is a genoese
and how did a leader of smugglers continued $m_franz_de_quesnel$ venture to build a #vessel# designed for such a #purpose# at genoa
i did not say that the owner was a smuggler replied the #sailor# no but $gaetano$ did i #thought#
$gaetano$ had only seen the #vessel# from a #distance# he had not then spoken to #anyone# and if this #person# be not a smuggler who is he
a wealthy signor who travels for his #pleasure# come #thought# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ he is still more mysterious since the two #account# do not agree
what is his #name# if you ask him he says sinbad the #sailor# but i #doubt# if it be his real #name#
sinbad the #sailor# yes and where does he reside on the #sea# what #country# does he come from
i do not know have you ever seen him sometimes what #sort# of a #man# is he
your #excellency# #will# judge for yourself where #will# he receive me no #doubt# in the subterranean palace
have you never had the curiosity when you have landed and found this #island# deserted to seek for this enchanted palace
oh yes more than once but always in vain we examined the grotto all over but we never could find the slightest trace of any #opening# they say that the #door# is not opened by a key but a magic #word#
$gaetano$ told you of decidedly muttered $m_franz_de_quesnel$ this is an arabian #night# adventure
his #excellency# waits for you said a #voice# which he recognized as that of the sentinel he was accompanied by two of
the yacht crew $m_franz_de_quesnel$ drew his handkerchief from his #pocket# and presented it to the #man# who had spoken to him
without uttering a #word# they bandaged his #eye# with a #care# that showed their apprehensions of his committing some indiscretion afterwards he was made to #promise# that he would not make the least attempt to raise the bandage
he promised then his two guides took his #arm# and he went on guided by them and preceded by the sentinel
after going about thirty paces he smelt the appetizing odor of the kid that was roasting and knew thus that he was passing the bivouac they then led him on about fifty paces farther evidently advancing towards that #part# of the shore where they would not allow $gaetano$ to go
presently by a change in the atmosphere he knew that they were entering a cave after going on for a few seconds more he heard a crackling and it seemed to him as though the atmosphere again changed and became balmy and perfumed
a refusal he could now comprehend at #length# his #foot# touched on a thick and soft carpet and his guides let go their hold of him
there was a #moment# #silence# and then a #voice# in excellent french although with a foreign accent said welcome #sir# i beg you #will# remove your bandage
it may be supposed then $m_franz_de_quesnel$ did not wait for a repetition of this permission but took off the handkerchief and found himself in the #presence# of a #man# from thirty eight to forty #year# of #age# dressed in a tunisian #costume# that is to say a red cap with a long blue silk tassel a vest of black cloth embroidered with #gold# pantaloons of deep red large and full gaiters of the same color embroidered with #gold# like the vest and yellow slippers he had a splendid cashmere round his waist and a small sharp and crooked cangiar was passed through his girdle
although of a paleness that was almost livid this #man# had a remarkably handsome #face# his #eye# were penetrating and sparkling his nose quite straight and projecting direct from the #brow# was of the pure greek type while his teeth as white as pearls were set off to admiration by the black moustache that encircled them
his pallor was so peculiar that it seemed to pertain to #one# who had been long entombed and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue of #life#
he was not particularly tall but extremely well made and like the #man# of the south had small #hand# and #foot#
but what astonished $m_franz_de_quesnel$ who had treated $gaetano$ description as a fable was the splendor of the #apartment# in which he found himself
in a recess was a kind of divan surmounted with a stand of arabian swords in silver scabbards and the handles resplendent with gems from the ceiling hung a lamp of venetian #glass# of beautiful shape and color while the #foot# rested on a turkey carpet in which they sunk to the instep tapestry hung before the #door# by which $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had entered and also in front of another #door# leading into a second #apartment# which seemed to be brilliantly illuminated
the host gave $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #time# to recover from his surprise and moreover returned #look# for #look# not even taking his #eye# off him
the entire #chamber# was lined with crimson brocade worked with flowers of #gold# #sir# he said after a pause
a thousand excuses for the precaution taken in your introduction hither but as during the greater portion of the #year# this #island# is deserted if the #secret# of this abode were discovered i should doubtless find on my #return# my temporary retirement in a state of great disorder which would be exceedingly annoying not for the loss it occasioned me but because i should not have the certainty i now possess of separating myself from all the #rest# of mankind at #pleasure#
let me now endeavor to make you forget this temporary unpleasantness and offer you what no #doubt# you did not expect to find here
that is to say a tolerable supper and pretty comfortable #bed# ma foi my dear #sir# replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ make no apologies
i have always observed that they bandage #people# #eye# who penetrate enchanted palaces for instance those of raoul in the huguenots and really i have #nothing# to complain of for what i see makes me think of the wonders of the arabian #night#
i may say with lucullus if i could have anticipated the #honor# of your #visit# i would have prepared for it
but such as is my hermitage it is at your disposal such as is my supper it is yours to share if you #will#
at this #moment# the tapestry moved aside and a nubian black as ebony and dressed in a plain white tunic made a #sign# to his #master# that all was prepared in the dining #room#
i do not know if you are of my #opinion# but i think #nothing# is more annoying than to remain two or three #hour# together without knowing by #name# or appellation how to address #one# another
alas $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ is the supper ready now said the unknown to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ pray observe that i too much respect the #law# of hospitality to ask your #name# or title
i only request you to give me #one# by which i may have the #pleasure# of addressing you as for myself that i may put you at your ease i tell you that i am generally called
and i replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #will# tell you as i only require his wonderful lamp to make me precisely like aladdin that i see no #reason# why at this #moment# i should not be called aladdin
that #will# keep us from going away from the east whither i am tempted to think i have been conveyed by some good genius
you heard our repast announced #will# you now take the trouble to enter the dining #room# your humble #servant# going first to show the #way#
sinbad the #sailor# well then signor aladdin replied the singular amphitryon at these #word# moving aside the tapestry sinbad preceded his #guest#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ now looked upon another #scene# of enchantment the #table# was splendidly covered and once convinced of this important #point# he cast his #eye# around him
the dining #room# was scarcely less striking than the #room# he had just left it was entirely of marble with antique bas reliefs of priceless value and at the four #corner# of this #apartment# which was oblong were four magnificent statues having baskets in their #hand#
these baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit there were sicily pine apples pomegranates from malaga oranges from the balearic isles peaches from france and dates from tunis
the supper consisted of a roast pheasant garnished with corsican blackbirds a boar ham with jelly a #quarter# of a kid with tartar sauce a glorious turbot and a gigantic lobster
between these large dishes were smaller #one# containing various dainties the dishes were of silver and the plates of japanese china
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ rubbed his #eye# in #order# to assure himself that this was not a #dream# $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ alone was present to wait at #table# and acquitted himself so admirably that the #guest# complimented his host thereupon
yes replied he while he did the #honor# of the supper with much ease and grace yes he is a poor devil who is much devoted to me and does all he can to prove it
he remembers that i saved his #life# and as he has a regard for his #head# he feels some gratitude towards me for having kept it on his #shoulder#
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ approached his #master# took his #hand# and kissed it would it be impertinent signor sinbad said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ to ask you the particulars of this kindness
it seems the #fellow# had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the bey of tunis than etiquette permits to #one# of his color and he was condemned by the bey to have his tongue cut out and his #hand# and #head# cut off the tongue the first #day# the #hand# the second and the #head# the third
i always had a #desire# to have a mute in my #service# so learning the #day# his tongue was cut out i went to the bey and proposed to give him for $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ a splendid double barreled gun which i knew he was very desirous of having
oh they are simple enough replied the host he hesitated a #moment# he was so very desirous to complete the poor devil punishment
but when i added to the gun an english cutlass with which i had shivered his highness yataghan to #piece# the bey yielded and agreed to forgive the #hand# and #head# but on condition that the poor #fellow# never again set #foot# in tunis
this was a useless clause in the bargain for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the shores of africa he runs down below and can only be induced to appear again when we are out of #sight# of that #quarter# of the globe
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ remained a #moment# silent and pensive hardly knowing what to think of the #half# kindness #half# cruelty with which his host related the brief narrative
and like the celebrated #sailor# whose #name# you have assumed he said by #way# of changing the #conversation# you pass your #life# in travelling
i made a vow at a #time# when i little #thought# i should ever be able to accomplish it said the unknown with a singular #smile#
yes and i made some #other# also which i #hope# i may fulfil in due season
although sinbad pronounced these #word# with much calmness his #eye# gave forth gleams of extraordinary ferocity you have suffered a great deal #sir# said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ inquiringly
sinbad started and looked fixedly at him as he replied what makes you suppose so #everything# answered $m_franz_de_quesnel$ your #voice# your #look# your pallid complexion and even the #life# you lead
i am pleased with #one# #place# and stay there i get tired of it and leave it i am free as a bird and have wings like #one# my attendants obey my slightest #wish#
i i live the happiest #life# possible the real #life# of a pasha i am #king# of all creation sometimes i amuse myself by delivering some #bandit# or criminal from the bonds of the #law#
then i have my mode of dispensing #justice# silent and sure without respite or appeal which condemns or pardons and which no #one# sees
ah if you had tasted my #life# you would not #desire# any #other# and would never #return# to the #world# unless you had some great project to accomplish there
the unknown fixed on the young #man# #one# of those #look# which penetrate into the depth of the #heart# and #thought#
because replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ you seem to me like a #man# who persecuted by society has a fearful #account# to settle with it
revenge for instance observed $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and why revenge he asked ah responded sinbad laughing with his singular laugh which displayed his white and sharp teeth
i am a #sort# of philosopher and #one# #day# perhaps i shall go to paris to rival $monsieur_cavalcanti$ appert and the #man# in the little blue cloak
you have not guessed rightly such as you see me and #will# that be the first #time# you ever took that journey
yes it #will# i must seem to you by no #mean# curious but i assure you that it is not my fault
i have delayed it so long it #will# happen #one# #day# or the #other# and do you propose to make this journey very shortly
i should like to be there at the #time# you come and i #will# endeavor to repay you as far as lies in my #power# for your liberal hospitality displayed to me at $m_de_monte_cristo$
i do not know it depends on #circumstance# which depend on certain arrangements i should avail myself of your offer with #pleasure# replied the host
the supper appeared to have been supplied solely for $m_franz_de_quesnel$ for the unknown scarcely touched #one# or two dishes of the splendid banquet to which his #guest# did ample #justice#
then $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ brought on the dessert or rather took the baskets from the #hand# of the statues and placed them on the #table#
but unfortunately if i go there it #will# be in all probability incognito between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a silver cover
he raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish paste #something# like preserved angelica but which was perfectly unknown to him
he replaced the lid as ignorant of what the cup contained as he was before he had looked at it and then casting his #eye# towards his host he saw him #smile# at his disappointment
the #care# with which $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ placed this cup on the #table# roused $m_franz_de_quesnel$ curiosity you cannot guess said he
what there is in that small vase can you no i really cannot well then that green preserve is #nothing# less than the ambrosia which hebe served at the #table# of jupiter
this ambrosia no #doubt# in passing through mortal #hand# has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed a human #name# in vulgar phrase what may you term this composition for which to tell the #truth# i do not feel any particular #desire#
cried sinbad we frequently pass so near to #happiness# without seeing without regarding it or if we do see and regard it yet without recognizing it
but replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ ah thus it is that our material origin is revealed are you a #man# for the substantials and is #gold# your god
taste this and the mines of peru guzerat and golconda are opened to you are you a #man# of imagination a poet
the fields of infinite space open to you you advance free in #heart# free in #mind# into the boundless realms of unfettered reverie
taste this and the boundaries of possibility disappear are you ambitious and do you seek after the greatnesses of the #earth#
taste this and in an #hour# you #will# be a #king# not a #king# of a petty kingdom hidden in some #corner# of europe like france spain or england but #king# of the #world# #king# of the universe #king# of creation without bowing at the #foot# of satan you #will# be #king# and #master# of all the kingdoms of the #earth#
is it not tempting what i offer you and is it not an easy #thing# since it is only to do thus
at these #word# he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so lauded took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat raised it to his #lip# and swallowed it slowly with his #eye# #half# shut and his #head# bent backwards
#look# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite sweetmeat but when he had finished he inquired what then is this precious stuff
did you ever hear he replied of the old #man# of the mountain who attempted to assassinate philippe auguste
well you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by the mountain whence he derived his picturesque #name#
of #course# i have in this valley were magnificent #garden# planted by hassen ben sabah and in these #garden# isolated pavilions
into these pavilions he admitted the elect and there says marco polo gave them to eat a certain herb which transported them to paradise in the midst of ever blooming shrubs ever ripe fruit and ever lovely virgins
what these happy #person# took for reality was but a #dream# but it was a #dream# so soft so voluptuous so enthralling that they sold themselves #body# and soul to him who gave it to them and obedient to his #order# as to those of a deity struck down the designated victim died in torture without a murmur believing that the #death# they underwent was but a quick transition to that #life# of delights of which the holy herb
now before you had given them a slight foretaste then cried $m_franz_de_quesnel$ it is hashish i know that by #name# at least
the purest and most unadulterated hashish of alexandria the hashish of abou gor the celebrated maker the only #man# the #man# to whom there should be built a palace inscribed with these #word#
that is it precisely signor aladdin it is hashish a grateful #world# to the dealer in #happiness#
do you know said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ i have a very great inclination to judge for myself of the #truth# or exaggeration of your eulogies
judge for yourself signor aladdin judge but do not confine yourself to #one# trial like #everything# else we must habituate the senses to a fresh impression gentle or violent sad or joyous
there is a struggle in #nature# against this divine substance in #nature# which is not made for #joy# and clings to pain
#nature# subdued must yield in the combat the #dream# must succeed to reality and then the #dream# reigns supreme then the #dream# becomes #life# and #life# becomes the #dream#
it is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the #joy# of the assumed existence that you would #desire# to live no longer but to #dream# thus forever
when you #return# to this mundane sphere from your visionary #world# you would seem to leave a neapolitan spring for a lapland winter to quit paradise for #earth#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous preparation about as much in quantity as his host had eaten and lift it to his mouth
but what changes occur heaven for hell taste the hashish #guest# of mine taste the hashish diable he said after having swallowed the divine preserve
i do not know if the result #will# be as agreeable as you describe but the #thing# does not appear to me as palatable as you say
tell me the first #time# you tasted oysters tea porter truffles and sundry #other# dainties which you now adore did you like them
because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of the substances it flavors could you comprehend how the romans stuffed their pheasants with assafœtida and the chinese eat swallows nests
well it is the same with hashish only eat for a week and #nothing# in the #world# #will# seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor which now appears to you flat and distasteful
eh no let us now go into the adjoining #chamber# which is your #apartment# and $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ #will# bring us coffee and pipes
they both arose and while he who called himself sinbad and whom we have occasionally named so that we might like his #guest# have some title by which to distinguish him
gave some #order# to the #servant# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ entered still another #apartment# it was simply yet richly furnished it was round and a large divan completely encircled it
divan #wall# ceiling #floor# were all covered with magnificent skins as soft and downy as the richest carpets there were heavy maned lion skins from atlas striped tiger skins from bengal
panther skins from the cape spotted beautifully like those that appeared to dante bear skins from siberia fox skins from norway and so on and all these skins were strewn in profusion #one# on the #other# so that it seemed like walking over the most mossy turf or reclining on the most luxurious #bed#
both laid themselves down on the divan chibouques with jasmine tubes and amber mouthpieces were within reach and all prepared so that there was no need to smoke the same pipe twice
there was a #moment# #silence# during which sinbad gave himself up to #thought# that seemed to occupy him incessantly even in the midst of his #conversation# and $m_franz_de_quesnel$ abandoned himself to that mute reverie into which we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco which seems to remove with its fume all the troubles of the #mind# and to give the smoker in exchange all the visions of the soul
each of them took #one# which $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ brought in the coffee
how do you take it inquired the unknown in the french or turkish style strong or weak sugar or none cool or boiling
as you please it is ready in all #way# i #will# take it in the turkish style replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$
and you are #right# said his host it shows you have a tendency for an oriental #life# ah those orientals they are the only #man# who know how to live
as for me he added with #one# of those singular #smile# which did not escape the young #man# when i have completed my #affair# in paris i shall go and die in the east and should you #wish# to see me again you must seek me at cairo bagdad or ispahan
wings springing out at my #shoulder# and with those wings i could make a tour of the #world# in four and twenty #hour#
ma foi said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ it would be the easiest #thing# in the #world# for i feel eagle
well unfurl your wings and fly into superhuman regions #fear# #nothing# there is a watch over you and if your wings like those of icarus melt before the sun we are here to ease your fall
he then said #something# in arabic to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ who made a #sign# of obedience and withdrew but not to any #distance#
ah yes the hashish is beginning its #work# as to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ a strange transformation had taken #place# in him
all the bodily fatigue of the #day# all the preoccupation of #mind# which the #event# of the #evening# had brought on disappeared as they do at the first approach of sleep when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of the coming of slumber
his #body# seemed to acquire an airy lightness his perception brightened in a remarkable #manner# his senses seemed to redouble their #power# the horizon continued to expand but it was not the gloomy horizon of vague alarms and which he had seen before he slept but a blue transparent unbounded horizon with all the blue of the ocean all the spangles of the sun all the perfumes of the summer breeze then in the midst of the songs of his #sailor# songs so clear and sonorous that they would have made a divine harmony had their #note# been taken down he saw the #island# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ no longer as a threatening #rock# in the midst of the waves but as an oasis in the desert then as his #boat# drew nearer the songs became louder for an enchanting and mysterious harmony rose to heaven as if some loreley had decreed to attract a soul thither or amphion the enchanter intended there to build a city
at #length# the #boat# touched the shore but without #effort# without shock as #lip# touch #lip# and he entered the grotto amidst continued strains of most delicious melody
he descended or rather seemed to descend several #step# inhaling the fresh and balmy #air# like that which may be supposed to reign around the grotto of circe formed from such perfumes as set the #mind# a dreaming and such #fire# as burn the very senses and he saw again all he had seen before his sleep from sinbad his singular host to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ the mute attendant then all seemed to fade away and become confused before his #eye# like the last #shadow# of the magic lantern before it is extinguished and he was again in the #chamber# of statues lighted only by #one# of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the #night# over the sleep of #pleasure#
they were the same statues rich in form in attraction and poesy with #eye# of fascination #smile# of #love# and bright and flowing #hair#
then among them glided like a pure ray like a christian angel in the midst of olympus #one# of those chaste figures those calm #shadow# those soft visions which seemed to veil its virgin #brow# before these marble wantons
then the three statues advanced towards him with #look# of #love# and approached the couch on which he was reposing their #foot# hidden in their long white tunics their throats bare #hair# flowing like waves and assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist but which saints withstood and #look# inflexible and ardent like those with which the serpent charms the bird and then he gave #way# before #look# that held him in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss
it seemed to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ that he closed his #eye# and in a last #look# about him saw the vision of modesty completely veiled and then followed a #dream# of passion like that promised by the prophet to the elect
#lip# of #stone# turned to flame breasts of ice became like heated lava so that to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ yielding for the first #time# to the sway of the drug #love# was a sorrow and voluptuousness a torture as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty #lip# and he was held in cool serpent like embraces
the more he strove against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall and at #length# weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul he gave #way# and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble goddesses and the enchantment of his marvellous #dream#
they were phryne cleopatra messalina those three celebrated courtesans #chapter# the waking when $m_franz_de_quesnel$ returned to himself he seemed still to be in a #dream#
he stretched forth his #hand# and touched #stone# he rose to his #seat# and found himself lying on his bournous in a #bed# of dry heather very soft and odoriferous
the vision had fled and as if the statues had been but #shadow# from the tomb they had vanished at his waking
he advanced several paces towards the #point# whence the #light# came and to all the excitement of his #dream# succeeded the calmness of reality
he found that he was in a grotto went towards the #opening# and through a kind of fanlight saw a blue #sea# and an azure sky
the #air# and #water# were shining in the beams of the #morning# sun on the shore the #sailor# were sitting chatting and laughing and at ten yards from them the #boat# was at anchor undulating gracefully on the #water#
there for some #time# he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his #brow# and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach that left against the #rock# a lace of foam as white as silver
he was for some #time# without reflection or #thought# for the divine charm which is in the #thing# of #nature# specially after a fantastic #dream# then gradually this view of the outer #world# so calm so pure so grand reminded him of the illusiveness of his vision and once more awakened memory
he recalled his arrival on the #island# his presentation to a smuggler chief a subterranean palace full of splendor an excellent supper and a spoonful of hashish
it seemed however even in the very #face# of open #day# that at least a #year# had elapsed since all these #thing# had passed so deep was the impression made in his #mind# by the #dream# and so strong a hold had it taken of his imagination
thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the #sailor# seated on a #rock# or undulating in the #vessel# #one# of the #shadow# which had shared his #dream# with #look# and kisses
otherwise his #head# was perfectly clear and his #body# refreshed he was free from the slightest headache on the #contrary# he felt a certain degree of lightness a faculty for absorbing the pure #air# and enjoying the bright sunshine more vividly than ever
he went gayly up to the #sailor# who rose as soon as they perceived him and the patron accosting him said
the signor sinbad has left his compliments for your #excellency# and #desire# us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave in #person# but he trusts you #will# excuse him as very important #business# calls him to malaga
he #thought# himself in a sepulchre into which a ray of sunlight in #pity# scarcely penetrated so then $gaetano$ said $m_franz_de_quesnel$
this is then all reality there exists a #man# who has received me in this #island# entertained me #right# royally and has departed while i was asleep
he exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all her sails spread and if you #will# #use# your #glass# you #will# in all probability recognize your host in the midst of his crew
so saying $gaetano$ pointed in a direction in which a small #vessel# was making sail towards the southern #point# of corsica
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ adjusted his telescope and directed it towards the yacht $gaetano$ was not mistaken at the stern the mysterious #stranger# was standing up looking towards the shore and holding a spy #glass# in his #hand#
he was attired as he had been on the previous #evening# and waved his #pocket# handkerchief to his #guest# in token of adieu
after a second a slight cloud of smoke was seen at the stern of the #vessel# which rose gracefully as it expanded in the #air# and then $m_franz_de_quesnel$ heard a slight report
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as an exchange of signals there do you hear observed $gaetano$
the young #man# took his carbine and fired it in the #air# but without any #idea# that the #noise# could be heard at the #distance# which separated the yacht from the shore
he is bidding you adieu what are your #excellency# #order# inquired $gaetano$ in the first #place# #light# me a torch
ah yes i understand replied the patron to find the entrance to the enchanted #apartment# with much #pleasure# your #excellency# if it would amuse you and i #will# get you the torch you ask for
but i too have had the #idea# you have and two or three #time# the same fancy has come over me but i have always given it up
giovanni #light# a torch he added and give it to his #excellency# giovanni obeyed $m_franz_de_quesnel$ took the lamp and entered the subterranean grotto followed by $gaetano$
he recognized the #place# where he had awaked by the #bed# of heather that was there but it was in vain that he carried his torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto
he saw #nothing# unless that by traces of smoke #other# had before him attempted the same #thing# and like him in vain
yet he did not leave a #foot# of this granite #wall# as impenetrable as futurity without strict scrutiny he did not see a fissure without introducing the blade of his hunting sword into it or a projecting #point# on which he did not lean and press in the #hope# it would give #way#
all was vain and he lost two #hour# in his attempts which were at last utterly useless at the #end# of this #time# he gave up his search and $gaetano$ smiled
when $m_franz_de_quesnel$ appeared again on the shore the yacht only seemed like a small white speck on the horizon he looked again through his #glass# but even then he could not distinguish #anything#
he took his fowling #piece# and began to hunt over the #island# with the #air# of a #man# who is fulfilling a #duty# rather than enjoying a #pleasure# and at the #end# of a #quarter# of an #hour# he had killed a goat and two kids
these animals though wild and agile as chamois were too much like domestic goats and $m_franz_de_quesnel$ could not consider them as game
$gaetano$ reminded him that he had come for the #purpose# of shooting goats which he had utterly forgotten moreover #other# #idea# much more enthralling occupied his #mind#
since the #evening# before he had really been the hero of #one# of the tales of the thousand and #one# #night# and he was irresistibly attracted towards the grotto
then in #spite# of the failure of his first search he began a second after having told $gaetano$ to roast #one# of the two kids
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ was sitting on the #spot# where he was on the previous #evening# when his mysterious host had invited him to supper and he saw the little yacht now like a #sea# gull on the wave continuing her flight towards corsica
the second #visit# was a long #one# and when he returned the kid was roasted and the repast ready why he remarked to $gaetano$
you told me that signor sinbad was going to malaga while it seems he is in the direction of porto vecchio
dont you remember said the patron i told you that among the crew there were two corsican brigands
ah he is #one# who #fear# neither god nor satan they say and would at any #time# run fifty leagues out of his #course# to do a poor devil a #service#
but such #service# as these might involve him with the authorities of the #country# in which he practices this kind of philanthropy said $m_franz_de_quesnel$
true and he is going to land them added $m_franz_de_quesnel$ precisely so replied $gaetano$ and what #care# he for that replied $gaetano$ with a laugh or any authorities
why in the first #place# his yacht is not a ship but a bird and he would beat any frigate three knots in every nine and if he were to throw himself on the coast why is he not certain of finding #friend# everywhere
it was perfectly clear that the signor sinbad $m_franz_de_quesnel$ host had the #honor# of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and #bandit# along the whole coast of the mediterranean and so enjoyed exceptional privileges
he #smile# at them let them try to pursue him as to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ he had no longer any inducement to remain at $m_de_monte_cristo$
he had lost all #hope# of detecting the #secret# of the grotto he consequently despatched his breakfast and his #boat# being ready he hastened on #board# and they were soon under #way#
at the #moment# the #boat# began her #course# they lost #sight# of the yacht as it disappeared in the gulf of porto vecchio
with it was effaced the last trace of the preceding #night# and then supper sinbad hashish statues all became a #dream# for $m_franz_de_quesnel$
the #boat# sailed on all #day# and all #night# and next #morning# when the sun rose they had lost #sight# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
when $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had once again set #foot# on shore he forgot for the #moment# at least the #event# which had just passed while he finished his #affair# of #pleasure# at florence and then #thought# of #nothing#
but how he should rejoin his #companion# who was awaiting him at rome he set out and on the saturday #evening# reached the #place# de la douane by the mail coach
an #apartment# as we have said had been retained beforehand and thus he had but to go to $signor_pastrini$ hotel
but this was not so easy a #matter# for the #street# were thronged with #people# and rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which precedes all great #event# and at rome there are four great #event# in every #year# the carnival holy week corpus christi and the feast of st peter
all the #rest# of the #year# the city is in that state of dull apathy between #life# and #death# which renders it similar to a kind of station between this #world# and the next a sublime #spot# a resting #place# full of poetry and character and at which $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had already halted five or six #time# and at each #time# found it more marvellous and striking
at last he made his #way# through the mob which was continually increasing and getting more and more turbulent and reached the hotel
on his first inquiry he was told with the impertinence peculiar to hired hackney coachmen and innkeepers with their #house# full that there was no #room# for him at the hôtel de londres
this #plan# succeeded and $signor_pastrini$ himself ran to him excusing himself for having made his #excellency# wait scolding the waiters taking the candlestick from the porter who was ready to pounce on the #traveller# and was about to lead him to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ when $m_albert_de_morcerf$ himself appeared
then he sent his card to $signor_pastrini$ and asked for $m_albert_de_morcerf$ the #apartment# consisted of two small #room# and a parlor
the #rest# of the #floor# was hired by a very rich #gentleman# who was supposed to be a sicilian or maltese but the host was unable to decide to which of the two nations the #traveller# belonged
the two #room# looked on to the #street# a #fact# which $signor_pastrini$ commented upon as an inappreciable advantage very good $signor_pastrini$ said $m_franz_de_quesnel$
but we must have some supper instantly and a #carriage# for #tomorrow# and the following #day# as to supper replied the landlord
you shall be served immediately but as for the #carriage# what as to the #carriage# exclaimed $m_albert_de_morcerf$ come come $signor_pastrini$ no joking we must have a #carriage#
#sir# replied the host we #will# do all in our #power# to procure you #one# this is all i can say
and when shall we know inquired $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #tomorrow# #morning# answered the innkeeper oh the deuce then we shall pay the more that all i see plainly enough
aaron #one# pays twenty five lire for common #day# and thirty or thirty five lire a #day# more for sundays and feast #day# add five lire a #day# more for extras that #will# make forty and there an #end# of it
at drake or i am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a #carriage#
then they must put #horse# to mine it is a little worse for the journey but that no #matter#
there are no #horse# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ looked at $m_franz_de_quesnel$ like a #man# who hears a reply he does not understand
do you understand that my dear $m_franz_de_quesnel$ no #horse# he said but cant we have post #horse# they have been all hired this fortnight and there are none left but those absolutely requisite for posting
i say that when a #thing# completely surpasses my comprehension i am accustomed not to dwell on that #thing# but to pass to another
what are we to say to this asked $m_franz_de_quesnel$ is supper ready $signor_pastrini$ yes your #excellency#
be easy my dear #boy# they #will# come in due season it is only a #question# of how much shall be charged for them
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ then with that delighted philosophy which believes that #nothing# is impossible to a full purse or well lined pocketbook supped went to #bed# slept soundly and dreamed he was racing all over rome at carnival #time# in a coach with six #horse#
well then let us sup but the #carriage# and #horse# said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #chapter# roman #bandit#
the next #morning# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ woke first and instantly rang the bell the #sound# had not yet died away when $signor_pastrini$ himself entered
well #excellency# said the landlord triumphantly and without waiting for $m_franz_de_quesnel$ to #question# him i feared #yesterday# when i would not #promise# you #anything# that you were too late
there is not a single #carriage# to be had that is for the three last #day# yes returned $m_franz_de_quesnel$ for the very three #day# it is most needed
what is the #matter# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ entering no #carriage# to be had just so returned $m_franz_de_quesnel$
that is to say #excellency# replied $signor_pastrini$ who was desirous of keeping up the dignity of the capital of the christian #world# in the #eye# of his #guest# that there are no #carriage# to be had from sunday to tuesday #evening# but from now till sunday you can have fifty if you please
you have guessed it well your eternal city is a nice #sort# of #place#
ah that is #something# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #today# is thursday and who knows what may arrive between this and sunday ten or twelve thousand #traveller# #will# arrive replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ which #will# make it still more difficult
my #friend# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ let us enjoy the present without gloomy forebodings for the future at least we can have a #window#
exclaimed $signor_pastrini$ utterly impossible there was only #one# left on the fifth #floor# of the doria palace and that has been let to a russian prince for twenty sequins a #day#
where in the corso ah a #window# the two young #man# looked at each #other# with an #air# of stupefaction
well said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ do you know what is the best #thing# we can do it is to pass the carnival at venice there we are sure of obtaining gondolas if we cannot have #carriage#
ah the devil no cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i came to rome to see the carnival and i #will# though i see it on stilts
bravo an excellent #idea# we #will# disguise ourselves as monster pulchinellos or shepherds of the landes and we shall have complete success
do your #excellency# still #wish# for a #carriage# from now to sunday #morning# parbleu said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
do you think we are going to run about on #foot# in the #street# of rome like lawyers clerks
i hasten to comply with your #excellency# #wish# only i tell you beforehand the #carriage# #will# cost you six piastres a #day#
i warn you that as i have been four #time# before at rome i know the prices of all the #carriage# we #will# give you twelve piastres for #today# #tomorrow# and the #day# after and then you #will# make a good profit
and as i am not a millionaire like the #gentleman# in the next #apartment# said $m_franz_de_quesnel$
but #excellency# said $signor_pastrini$ still striving to gain his #point# now go returned $m_franz_de_quesnel$ or i shall go myself and bargain with your affettatore who is mine also
he is an old #friend# of mine who has plundered me pretty well already and in the #hope# of making more out of me he #will# take a less price than the #one# i offer you you #will# lose the preference and that #will# be your fault
do not give yourselves the trouble #excellency# returned $signor_pastrini$ with the #smile# peculiar to the italian speculator when he confesses defeat
i #will# do all i can and i #hope# you #will# be satisfied and now we understand each #other#
when do you #wish# the #carriage# to be here in an #hour# in an #hour# it #will# be at the #door#
an #hour# after the vehicle was at the #door# it was a hack conveyance which was elevated to the rank of a private #carriage# in #honor# of the occasion but in #spite# of its humble exterior the young #man# would have #thought# themselves happy to have secured it for the last three #day# of the carnival
#excellency# cried the cicerone seeing $m_franz_de_quesnel$ approach the #window# shall i bring the #carriage# nearer to the palace
accustomed as $m_franz_de_quesnel$ was to the italian phraseology his first impulse was to #look# round him but these #word# were addressed to him
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ was the #excellency# the vehicle was the #carriage# and the hôtel de londres was the palace the genius for laudation characteristic of the race was in that phrase
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ descended the #carriage# approached the palace their #excellency# stretched their legs along the #seat# the cicerone sprang into the #seat# behind
where do your #excellency# #wish# to go asked he to saint peter first and then to the colosseum returned $m_albert_de_morcerf$
but $m_albert_de_morcerf$ did not know that it takes a #day# to see saint peter and a #month# to #study# it the #day# was passed at saint peter alone
suddenly the daylight began to fade away $m_franz_de_quesnel$ took out his watch it was #half# past four they returned to the hotel at the #door# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ ordered the coachman to be ready at eight
when we show a #friend# a city #one# has already visited we feel the same pride as when we #point# out a #woman# whose lover we have been
he was to leave the city by the porta del popolo skirt the outer #wall# and re enter by the porta san giovanni thus they would behold the colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the capitol the forum the arch of septimus severus the temple of antoninus and faustina and the via sacra
he wished to show $m_albert_de_morcerf$ the colosseum by moonlight as he had shown him saint peter by daylight they sat down to #dinner#
$signor_pastrini$ had promised them a banquet he gave them a tolerable repast at the #end# of the #dinner# he entered in #person#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ #thought# that he came to hear his #dinner# praised and began accordingly but at the first #word# he was interrupted
#excellency# said $signor_pastrini$ i am delighted to have your approbation but it was not for that i came
no and your #excellency# #will# do well not to think of that any longer at rome #thing# can or cannot be done when you are told #anything# cannot be done there is an #end# of it
did you come to tell us you have procured a #carriage# asked $m_albert_de_morcerf$ lighting his cigar
it is much more convenient at paris when #anything# cannot be done you pay double and it is done directly
that is what all the french say returned $signor_pastrini$ somewhat piqued for that #reason# i do not understand why they travel
but said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ emitting a volume of smoke and balancing his #chair# on its hind legs only madmen or blockheads like us ever do travel
#man# in their senses do not quit their hotel in the $rue_du_helder$ their walk on the boulevard de gand and the café de paris
it is of #course# understood that $m_albert_de_morcerf$ resided in the aforesaid #street# appeared every #day# on the fashionable walk and dined frequently at the only restaurant where you can really dine that is if you are on good terms with its waiters
$signor_pastrini$ remained silent a short #time# it was evident that he was musing over this #answer# which did not seem very clear
but said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ in his #turn# interrupting his host meditations you had some motive for coming here may i beg to know what it was
ah yes you have ordered your #carriage# at eight clock precisely i have you intend visiting il colosseo
you have told your coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo to drive round the #wall# and re enter by the porta san giovanni
you #mean# the colosseum it is the same #thing# these are my #word# exactly well this route is impossible
impossible very dangerous to say the least dangerous and why on #account# of the famous $luigi_vampa$
pray who may this famous $luigi_vampa$ be inquired $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he may be very famous at rome but i can assure you he is quite unknown at paris
what do you not know him i have not that #honor# you have never heard his #name#
never well then he is a #bandit# compared to whom the decesaris and the gasparones were mere #child#
i forewarn you $signor_pastrini$ that i shall not believe #one# #word# of what you are going to tell us having told you this begin
now then $m_albert_de_morcerf$ cried $m_franz_de_quesnel$ here is a #bandit# for you at last once upon a #time#
well go on $signor_pastrini$ turned toward $m_franz_de_quesnel$ who seemed to him the more reasonable of the two we must do him
#excellency# said he gravely addressing $m_franz_de_quesnel$ if you #look# upon me as a liar it is useless for me to say #anything# it was for your #interest# i
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ does not say you are a liar $signor_pastrini$ said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ but that he #will# not believe what you are going to tell us but i #will# believe all you say so proceed
#justice# he had had a great many frenchmen in his $house_of_peers$ but had never been able to comprehend them
you are more susceptible than cassandra who was a prophetess and yet no #one# believed her while you at least are sure of the credence of #half# your audience
but if your #excellency# #doubt# my veracity $signor_pastrini$ returned $m_franz_de_quesnel$ come sit down and tell us all about this signor $luigi_vampa$
i had told your #excellency# he is the most famous #bandit# we have had since the #day# of mastrilla
well what has this #bandit# to do with the #order# i have given the coachman to leave the city by the porta del popolo and to re enter by the porta san giovanni
this replied $signor_pastrini$ that you #will# go out by #one# but i very much #doubt# your returning by the #other#
why asked $m_franz_de_quesnel$ because after nightfall you are not safe fifty yards from the #gate#
on your #honor# is that true cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #count# returned $signor_pastrini$ hurt at $m_albert_de_morcerf$ repeated #doubt# of the #truth# of his assertions
i do not say this to you but to your #companion# who knows rome and knows too that these #thing# are not to be laughed at
my dear #fellow# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ turning to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ here is an admirable adventure we #will# fill our #carriage# with #pistol# blunderbusses and double barrelled guns
we bring him back to rome and present him to his holiness the pope who asks how he can repay so great a #service# then we merely ask for a #carriage# and a pair of #horse# and we see the carnival in the #carriage# and doubtless the roman #people# #will# crown us at the capitol and proclaim us like curtius and horatius $cocles$ the preservers of their #country#
$luigi_vampa$ comes to take us and we take him whilst $m_albert_de_morcerf$ proposed this scheme $signor_pastrini$ #face# assumed an #expression# impossible to describe
and pray asked $m_franz_de_quesnel$ where are these #pistol# blunderbusses and #other# deadly weapons with which you intend filling the #carriage#
not out of my armory for at terracina i was plundered even of my hunting knife and you i shared the same fate at aquapendente
do you know $signor_pastrini$ said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ lighting a second cigar at the first that this practice is very convenient for #bandit# and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own
doubtless $signor_pastrini$ found this pleasantry compromising for he only answered #half# the #question# and then he spoke to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ as the only #one# likely to listen with #attention#
your #excellency# knows that it is not customary to defend yourself when attacked by #bandit#
what cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$ whose courage revolted at the #idea# of being plundered tamely not make any resistance no for it would be useless
what could you do against a dozen #bandit# who spring out of some pit ruin or aqueduct and level their #piece# at you
eh parbleu they should kill me the innkeeper turned to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ with an #air# that seemed to say
let him die of corneille only when horace made that #answer# the safety of rome was concerned but as for us it is only to gratify a whim and it would be ridiculous to risk our #life# for so foolish a motive
your #friend# is decidedly mad my dear $m_albert_de_morcerf$ returned $m_franz_de_quesnel$ your #answer# is sublime and worthy the $m_albert_de_morcerf$ poured himself out a #glass# of lacryma christi which he sipped at intervals muttering some unintelligible #word#
well $signor_pastrini$ said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ now that my #companion# is quieted and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are tell me who is this $luigi_vampa$
is he a shepherd or a nobleman young or old tall or short describe him in #order# that if we meet him by #chance# like jean sbogar or lara we may recognize him
you could not apply to #anyone# better able to inform you on all these #point# for i knew him when he was a #child# and #one# #day# that i fell into his #hand# going from ferentino to alatri he fortunately for me recollected me and set me free not only without ransom but made me a present of a very splendid watch and related his history to me
$signor_pastrini$ drew from his fob a magnificent bréguet bearing the #name# of its maker of parisian manufacture and a #count# coronet
let us see the watch said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ here it is said he peste returned $m_albert_de_morcerf$
i compliment you on it i have its #fellow# he took his watch from his waistcoat #pocket# and it cost me #franc#
let us hear the history said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ motioning $signor_pastrini$ to #seat# himself your #excellency# permit it asked the host
the host sat down after having made each of them a respectful bow which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning $luigi_vampa$
you tell me said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ at the #moment# $signor_pastrini$ was about to open his mouth that you knew $luigi_vampa$ when he was a #child#
$pardieu$ cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$ you are not a preacher to remain standing he is still a young #man# then
a young #man# he is only two and twenty he #will# gain himself a reputation what do you think of that $m_albert_de_morcerf$ at two and twenty to be thus famous
yes and at his #age# alexander $cæsar_borgia$ and $napoleon$ who have all made some #noise# in the #world# were quite behind him
so continued $m_franz_de_quesnel$ the hero of this history is only two and twenty scarcely so much
is he tall or short of the middle height about the same stature as his #excellency# returned the host pointing to $m_albert_de_morcerf$
#thank# for the comparison said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with a bow go on $signor_pastrini$ continued $m_franz_de_quesnel$ smiling at his #friend# susceptibility
he was a shepherd #boy# attached to the farm of the #count# of san felice situated between palestrina and the lake of gabri he was born at pampinara and entered the #count# #service# when he was five #year# old his #father# was also a shepherd who owned a small flock and lived by the wool and the milk which he sold at rome
to what class of society does he belong when quite a #child# the little $luigi_vampa$ displayed a most extraordinary precocity
#one# #day# when he was seven #year# old he came to the curate of palestrina and asked to be taught to read it was somewhat difficult for he could not quit his flock but the good curate went every #day# to say mass at a little hamlet too poor to pay a #priest# and which having no #other# #name# was called borgo he told $luigi_vampa$ that he might meet him on his #return# and that then he would give him a lesson warning him that it would be short and that he must profit as much as possible by it
every #day# $luigi_vampa$ led his flock to graze on the #road# that leads from palestrina to borgo every #day# at nine clock in the #morning# the #priest# and the #boy# sat down on a bank by the wayside and the little shepherd took his lesson out of the #priest#
the #child# accepted joyfully breviary at the #end# of three #month# he had learned to read this was not enough he must now learn to write
the #priest# had a writing teacher at rome make three alphabets #one# large #one# middling and #one# small and pointed out to him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the #letter# on a slate and thus learn to write
the same #evening# when the flock was safe at the farm the little $luigi_vampa$ hastened to the smith at palestrina took a large nail heated and sharpened it and formed a #sort# of stylus
the next #morning# he gathered an armful of #piece# of slate and began at the #end# of three #month# he had learned to write
this demanded new #effort# but #nothing# compared to the first at the #end# of a week he wrote as well with this pen as with the stylus
the curate related the incident to the #count# of san felice who sent for the little shepherd made him read and write before him ordered his attendant to let him eat with the domestics and to give him two piastres a #month#
the curate astonished at his quickness and intelligence made him a present of pens #paper# and a penknife with this $luigi_vampa$ purchased books and pencils
he applied his imitative #power# to #everything# and like giotto when young he drew on his slate sheep #house# and #tree#
then with his knife he began to carve all #sort# of objects in wood it was thus that pinelli the famous sculptor had commenced
a #girl# of six or seven that is a little younger than $luigi_vampa$ tended sheep on a farm near palestrina she was an orphan born at valmontone and was named $teresa$
the two #child# met sat down near each #other# let their flocks mingle together played laughed and conversed together
in the #evening# they separated the #count# of san felice flock from those of #baron# cervetri and the #child# returned to their respective farms promising to meet the next #morning#
the next #day# they kept their #word# and thus they grew up together $luigi_vampa$ was twelve and $teresa$ eleven and yet their natural disposition revealed itself
beside his taste for the fine arts which $luigi_vampa$ had carried as far as he could in his solitude he was given to alternating fits of sadness and enthusiasm was often angry and capricious and always sarcastic
none of the lads of pampinara palestrina or valmontone had been able to gain any influence over him or even to become his #companion#
$teresa$ alone ruled by a #look# a #word# a gesture this impetuous character which yielded beneath the #hand# of a #woman# and which beneath the #hand# of a #man# might have broken but could never have been bended
his disposition always inclined to exact concessions rather than to make them kept him aloof from all friendships $teresa$ was lively and gay but coquettish to excess
the two piastres that $luigi_vampa$ received every #month# from the #count# of san felice steward and the price of all the little carvings in wood he sold at rome were expended in ear rings necklaces and #gold# hairpins
the two #child# grew up together passing all their #time# with each #other# and giving themselves up to the wild #idea# of their different characters
thus in all their #dream# their #wish# and their #conversation# $luigi_vampa$ saw himself the #captain# of a #vessel# general of an army or #governor# of a province
so that #thank# to her #friend# generosity $teresa$ was the most beautiful and the best attired peasant near rome $teresa$ saw herself rich superbly attired and attended by a train of liveried domestics
then when they had thus passed the #day# in building castles in the #air# they separated their flocks and descended from the elevation of their #dream# to the reality of their humble #position#
#one# #day# the young shepherd told the #count# steward that he had seen a wolf come out of the sabine mountains and prowl around his flock
this gun had an excellent barrel made at brescia and carrying a ball with the precision of an english rifle but #one# #day# the #count# broke the stock and had then cast the gun aside
this however was #nothing# to a sculptor like $luigi_vampa$ he examined the broken stock calculated what change it would require to adapt the gun to his #shoulder# and made a fresh stock so beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres had he chosen to sell it
the steward gave him a gun this was what $luigi_vampa$ longed for but #nothing# could be farther from his #thought#
in every #country# where independence has taken the #place# of #liberty# the first #desire# of a manly #heart# is to possess a weapon which at once renders him capable of defence or attack and by rendering its owner terrible often makes him feared
from this #moment# $luigi_vampa$ devoted all his leisure #time# to perfecting himself in the #use# of his precious weapon he purchased powder and ball and #everything# served him for a mark
for a long #time# a gun had been the young #man# greatest ambition the trunk of some old and moss grown olive #tree#
that grew on the sabine mountains the fox as he quitted his #earth# on some marauding excursion the eagle that soared above their #head# and thus he soon became so expert that $teresa$ overcame the #terror# she at first felt at the report and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased with as much accuracy as if he placed it by #hand#
#one# #evening# a wolf emerged from a pine wood near which they were usually stationed but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten yards ere he was dead
proud of this exploit $luigi_vampa$ took the dead animal on his #shoulder# and carried him to the farm these exploits had gained $luigi_vampa$ considerable reputation
he was spoken of as the most adroit the strongest and the most courageous contadino for ten leagues around and although $teresa$ was universally allowed to be the most beautiful #girl# of the sabines no #one# had ever spoken to her of #love# because it was known that she was beloved by $luigi_vampa$
and yet the two young #people# had never declared their affection they had grown together like two #tree# whose roots are mingled whose branches intertwined and whose intermingled perfume rises to the heavens
the #man# of superior abilities always finds admirers go where he #will# only their #wish# to see each #other# had become a necessity and they would have preferred #death# to a #day#
about this #time# a band of brigands that had established itself in the lepini mountains began to be much spoken of
separation $teresa$ was sixteen and $luigi_vampa$ seventeen the brigands have never been really extirpated from the neighborhood of rome
sometimes a chief is wanted but when a chief presents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers
the celebrated cucumetto pursued in the abruzzo driven out of the kingdom of naples where he had carried on a regular war had crossed the garigliano like manfred and had taken refuge on the banks of the amasine between sonnino and juperno
he strove to collect a band of followers and followed the footsteps of decesaris and gasparone whom he hoped to surpass
many young #man# of palestrina frascati and pampinara had disappeared their disappearance at first caused much disquietude but it was soon known that they had joined cucumetto
after some #time# cucumetto became the object of universal #attention# the most extraordinary traits of ferocious daring and brutality were related of him
the #bandit# #law# are positive a young #girl# belongs first to him who carries her off then the #rest# draw lots for her and she is abandoned to their brutality until #death# relieves her sufferings
when their parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom a messenger is sent to negotiate the #prisoner# is hostage for the security of the messenger should the ransom be refused the #prisoner# is irrevocably lost
#one# #day# he carried off a young #girl# the #daughter# of a surveyor of frosinone the young #girl# lover was in cucumetto troop his #name# was $carlini$
when she recognized her lover the poor #girl# extended her #arm# to him and believed herself safe but $carlini$ felt his #heart# sink for he
however as he was a favorite with cucumetto as he had for three #year# faithfully served him and as he had saved his #life# by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down he hoped the chief would have #pity# on him
he took cucumetto #one# #side# while the young #girl# seated at the #foot# of a huge pine that stood in the centre of the forest made a veil of her picturesque #head# dress to hide her #face# from the lascivious gaze of the #bandit#
there he told the chief all his affection for the #prisoner# their #promise# of mutual fidelity and how every #night# since he had been near they had met in some neighboring ruins
it so happened that #night# that cucumetto had sent $carlini$ to a village so that he had been unable to go to the #place# of meeting
but too well knew the fate that awaited her cucumetto had been there however by accident as he said and had carried the maiden off
$carlini$ besought his chief to make an exception in $rita$ favor as her #father# was rich and could pay a large ransom
cucumetto seemed to yield to his #friend# entreaties and bade him find a shepherd to send to $rita$ #father# at frosinone
$carlini$ flew joyfully to $rita$ telling her she was saved and bidding her write to her #father# to inform him what had occurred and that her ransom was fixed at three hundred piastres
twelve #hour# delay was all that was granted that is until nine the next #morning# the #instant# the #letter# was written $carlini$ seized it and hastened to the plain to find a messenger
the natural messengers of the #bandit# are the shepherds who live between the city and the mountains between civilized and savage #life#
he found a young shepherd watching his flock the #boy# undertook the commission promising to be in frosinone in less than an #hour#
he found the troop in the glade supping off the provisions exacted as contributions from the peasants but his #eye# vainly sought $rita$ and cucumetto among them
$carlini$ returned anxious to see his mistress and announce the joyful intelligence he inquired where they were and was answered by a burst of laughter
#one# of the #bandit# rose and offered him a #glass# filled with orvietto saying to the health of the brave cucumetto and the fair $rita$
at this #moment# $carlini$ heard a #woman# #cry# he divined the #truth# seized the #glass# broke it across the #face# of him who presented it and rushed towards the #spot# whence the #cry# came
a cold perspiration burst from every pore and his #hair# stood on #end# he repeated his #question# after a hundred yards he turned the #corner# of the thicket he found $rita$ senseless in the #arm# of cucumetto
at the #sight# of $carlini$ cucumetto rose a #pistol# in each #hand# the two brigands looked at each #other# for a #moment#
a terrible battle between the two #man# seemed imminent but by degrees $carlini$ #feature# relaxed his #hand# which had grasped #one# of the #pistol# in his belt fell to his #side#
the #one# with a #smile# of lasciviousness on his #lip# the #other# with the pallor of #death# on his #brow# $rita$ lay between them
the moon lighted the group well said cucumetto have you executed your commission yes #captain# returned $carlini$
it is well in the meantime we #will# have a merry #night# this young #girl# is charming and does credit to your taste
at nine clock #tomorrow# $rita$ #father# #will# be here with the #money# now as i am not egotistical we #will# #return# to our comrades and draw lots for her
you have determined then to abandon her to the common #law# said $carlini$ why should an exception be made in her favor
i #thought# that my entreaties what #right# have you any more than the #rest# to ask for an exception
it is true but never #mind# continued cucumetto laughing sooner or later your #turn# #will# come
$carlini$ teeth clenched convulsively now then said cucumetto advancing towards the #other# #bandit# are you coming
cucumetto departed without losing #sight# of $carlini$ for doubtless he feared lest he should strike him unawares but #nothing# betrayed a hostile design on $carlini$ #part#
cucumetto fancied for a #moment# the young #man# was about to take her in his #arm# and fly but this mattered little to him now $rita$ had been his and as for the #money# three hundred piastres distributed among the band was so small a #sum# that he cared little about it
he continued to follow the path to the glade but to his great surprise $carlini$ arrived almost as soon as himself
i follow you he was standing his #arm# folded near $rita$ who was still insensible let us draw lots let us draw lots
cried all the brigands when they saw the chief their demand was fair and the chief inclined his #head# in #sign# of acquiescence
the #eye# of all shone fiercely as they made their demand and the red #light# of the #fire# made them #look# like demons
the #name# of all including $carlini$ were placed in a hat and the youngest of the band drew forth a ticket the ticket bore the #name# of diavolaccio
he was the #man# who had proposed to $carlini$ the health of their chief and to whom $carlini$ replied by breaking the #glass# across his #face#
a large wound extending from the temple to the mouth was bleeding profusely diavolaccio seeing himself thus favored by #fortune# burst into a loud laugh
just now $carlini$ would not drink your health when i proposed it to him propose mine to him and let us see if he #will# be more condescending to you than to me
#everyone# expected an explosion on $carlini$ #part# but to their great surprise he took a #glass# in #one# #hand# and a flask in the #other# and filling it
#captain# said he your health diavolaccio said he calmly and he drank it off without his #hand# trembling in the least
then sitting down by the #fire# my supper said he my expedition has given me an appetite
well done $carlini$ cried the brigands that is acting like a good #fellow# and they all formed a circle round the #fire# while diavolaccio disappeared
$carlini$ ate and drank as if #nothing# had happened the #bandit# looked on with #astonishment# at this singular conduct until they heard footsteps
they turned round and saw diavolaccio bearing the young #girl# in his #arm# her #head# hung back and her long #hair# swept the #ground#
as they entered the circle the #bandit# could perceive by the firelight the unearthly pallor of the young #girl# and of diavolaccio
this apparition was so strange and so solemn that #everyone# rose with the exception of $carlini$ who remained seated and ate and drank calmly
diavolaccio advanced amidst the most profound #silence# and laid $rita$ at the #captain# #foot# then #everyone# could understand the cause of the unearthly pallor in the young #girl# and the #bandit#
a knife was plunged up to the hilt in $rita$ left breast #everyone# looked at $carlini$ the sheath at his belt was empty
ah ah said the chief i now understand why $carlini$ stayed behind all savage #nature# appreciate a desperate deed
no #other# of the #bandit# would perhaps have done the same but they all understood what $carlini$ had done
now then cried $carlini$ rising in his #turn# and approaching the corpse his #hand# on the butt of #one# of his #pistol#
does #anyone# dispute the #possession# of this #woman# with me no returned the chief she is thine
cucumetto placed his sentinels for the #night# and the #bandit# wrapped themselves in their cloaks and lay down before the #fire#
$carlini$ raised her in his #arm# and carried her out of the circle of firelight at midnight the sentinel gave the alarm and in an #instant# all were on the alert
it was $rita$ #father# who brought his #daughter# ransom in #person# here said he to cucumetto here are three hundred piastres give me back my #child#
but the chief without taking the #money# made a #sign# to him to follow the old #man# obeyed they both advanced beneath the #tree# through whose branches streamed the moonlight
cucumetto stopped at last and pointed to two #person# grouped at the #foot# of a #tree# there said he
demand thy #child# of $carlini$ he #will# tell thee what has become of her and he returned to his #companion#
the old #man# remained motionless he felt that some great and unforeseen #misfortune# hung over his #head# at #length# he advanced toward the group the meaning of which he could not comprehend
as he approached $carlini$ raised his #head# and the forms of two #person# became visible to the old #man# #eye#
a #woman# lay on the #ground# her #head# resting on the knees of a #man# who was seated by her as he raised his #head# the #woman#
#face# became visible the old #man# recognized his #child# and $carlini$ recognized the old #man# i expected thee said the #bandit# to $rita$ #father#
wretch returned the old #man# what hast thou done and he gazed with #terror# on $rita$ pale and bloody a knife buried in her bosom
a ray of moonlight poured through the #tree# and lighted up the #face# of the dead cucumetto had violated thy #daughter# said the #bandit#
i loved her therefore i slew her for she would have served as the sport of the whole band
if i have done wrongly avenge her and withdrawing the knife from the wound in $rita$ bosom he held it out to the old #man# with #one# #hand# while with the #other# he tore open his vest
the old #man# spoke not and grew pale as #death# now continued $carlini$ thou hast done well returned the old #man# in a hoarse #voice# embrace me my #son#
$carlini$ threw himself sobbing like a #child# into the #arm# of his mistress #father# these were the first #tear# the #man# of #blood# had ever wept
$carlini$ fetched two pickaxes and the #father# and the lover began to dig at the #foot# of a huge oak beneath which the young #girl# was to repose
when the grave was formed the #father# embraced her first and then the lover afterwards #one# taking the #head# the #other# the #foot# they placed her in the grave
now said the old #man# aid me to bury my #child# then they knelt on each #side# of the grave and said the prayers of the dead
then when they had finished they cast the #earth# over the corpse until the grave was filled then extending his #hand# the old #man# said
i #thank# you my #son# and now leave me alone yet replied $carlini$ leave me i command you
$carlini$ obeyed rejoined his comrades folded himself in his cloak and soon appeared to sleep as soundly as the #rest#
it had been resolved the #night# before to change their encampment an #hour# before daybreak cucumetto aroused his #man# and gave the #word# to march
but $carlini$ would not quit the forest without knowing what had become of $rita$ #father# he went toward the #place# where he had left him
he then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the dead #body# of the #one# and the tomb of the #other#
but he was unable to complete this oath for two #day# afterwards in an encounter with the roman carbineers $carlini$ was killed
there was some surprise however that as he was with his #face# to the #enemy# he should have received a ball between his #shoulder#
that #astonishment# ceased when #one# of the brigands remarked to his comrades that cucumetto was stationed ten paces in $carlini$ rear when he fell
on the #morning# of the departure from the forest of frosinone he had followed $carlini$ in the #darkness# and heard this oath of vengeance and like a wise #man# anticipated it
he found the old #man# suspended from #one# of the branches of the oak which shaded his #daughter# grave they told ten #other# #story# of this #bandit# chief each more singular than the #other#
thus from fondi to perusia #everyone# trembles at the #name# of cucumetto these narratives were frequently the theme of #conversation# between $luigi_vampa$ and $teresa$
the young #girl# trembled very much at hearing the #story# but $luigi_vampa$ reassured her with a #smile# tapping the butt of his good fowling #piece# which threw its ball so well and if that did not restore her courage he pointed to a crow perched on some dead branch took aim touched the trigger and the bird fell dead at the #foot# of the #tree#
#time# passed on and the two young #people# had agreed to be married when $luigi_vampa$ should be twenty and $teresa$ nineteen #year# of #age#
#one# #day# when they were talking over their #plan# for the future they heard two or three reports of firearms and then suddenly a #man# came out of the wood near which the two young #person# used to graze their flocks and hurried towards them
they were both orphans and had only their employers leave to ask which had been already sought and obtained when he came within hearing he exclaimed
they knew full well that this fugitive must be a #bandit# but there is an innate sympathy between the roman brigand and the roman peasant and the latter is always ready to aid the former
$luigi_vampa$ without saying a #word# hastened to the #stone# that closed up the entrance to their grotto drew it away made a #sign# to the fugitive to take refuge there in a retreat unknown to #everyone# closed the #stone# upon him and then went and resumed his #seat# by $teresa$
instantly afterwards four carbineers on horseback appeared on the edge of the wood three of them appeared to be looking for the fugitive while the fourth dragged a brigand #prisoner# by the neck
i am pursued can you conceal me the three carbineers looked about carefully on every #side# saw the young peasants and galloping up began to #question# them
they had seen no #one# that is very annoying said the brigadier for the #man# we are looking for is the chief
and as his #head# is valued at a thousand roman crowns there would have been five hundred for you if you had helped us to catch him
cucumetto cried $luigi_vampa$ and $teresa$ at the same #moment# yes replied the brigadier the two young #person# exchanged #look#
five hundred roman crowns are three thousand lire and three thousand lire are a #fortune# for two poor orphans who are going to be married
the brigadier had a #moment# #hope# yes it is very annoying said $luigi_vampa$ but we have not seen him
then the carbineers scoured the #country# in different directions but in vain then after a #time# they disappeared $luigi_vampa$ then removed the #stone# and cucumetto came out
through the crevices in the granite he had seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers and guessed the #subject# of their parley
he had read in the #countenance# of $luigi_vampa$ and $teresa$ their steadfast resolution not to surrender him and he drew from his #pocket# a purse full of #gold# which he offered to them
but $luigi_vampa$ raised his #head# proudly as to $teresa$ her #eye# sparkled when she #thought# of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of #gold#
cucumetto was a cunning fiend and had assumed the form of a brigand instead of a serpent and this #look# from $teresa$ showed to him that she was a worthy #daughter# of eve and he returned to the forest pausing several #time# on his #way# under the pretext of saluting his protectors
several #day# elapsed and they neither saw nor heard of cucumetto the #time# of the carnival was at #hand#
the #count# of san felice announced a grand masked ball to which all that were distinguished in rome were invited $teresa$ had a great #desire# to see this ball
$luigi_vampa$ asked permission of his protector the steward that she and he might be present amongst the #servant# of the $house_of_peers$
this was granted the ball was given by the #count# for the particular #pleasure# of his #daughter# $carmela$ whom he adored
on the #evening# of the ball $teresa$ was attired in her best her most brilliant ornaments in her #hair# and gayest #glass# beads she was in the #costume# of the #woman# of frascati
$carmela$ was precisely the #age# and figure of $teresa$ and $teresa$ was as handsome as $carmela$ $luigi_vampa$ wore the very picturesque garb of the roman peasant at holiday #time#
the festa was magnificent not only was the villa brilliantly illuminated but thousands of colored lanterns were suspended from the #tree# in the #garden# and very soon the palace overflowed to the terraces and the terraces to the #garden# walks
at each cross path was an orchestra and #table# spread with refreshments the #guest# stopped formed quadrilles and danced in any #part# of the #ground# they pleased
they both mingled as they had leave to do with the #servant# and peasants $carmela$ was attired like a #woman# of sonnino
her cap was embroidered with pearls the pins in her #hair# were of #gold# and #diamond# her girdle was of turkey silk with large embroidered flowers her bodice and skirt were of cashmere her apron of indian muslin and the buttons of her corset were of jewels
two of her #companion# were dressed the #one# as a #woman# of nettuno and the #other# as a #woman# of la riccia
four young #man# of the richest and noblest #family# of rome accompanied them with that italian freedom which has not its parallel in any #other# #country# in the #world#
they were attired as peasants of albano velletri civita castellana and sora we need hardly add that these peasant #costume# like those of the young #woman# were brilliant with #gold# and jewels
$carmela$ looked all around her but not #one# of the #guest# had a #costume# similar to her own or those of her #companion#
$carmela$ wished to form a quadrille but there was #one# #lady# wanting the #count# of san felice pointed out $teresa$ who was hanging on $luigi_vampa$ #arm# in a group of peasants
#will# you allow me #father# said $carmela$ certainly replied the #count# are we not in carnival #time#
$carmela$ turned towards the young #man# who was talking with her and saying a few #word# to him pointed with her #finger# to $teresa$
the young #man# looked bowed in obedience and then went to $teresa$ and invited her to dance in a quadrille directed by the #count# #daughter#
$luigi_vampa$ slowly relinquished $teresa$ #arm# which he had held beneath his own and $teresa$ accompanied by her elegant cavalier took her appointed #place# with much agitation in the aristocratic quadrille
certainly in the #eye# of an artist the exact and strict #costume# of $teresa$ had a very different character from that of $carmela$ and her #companion# and $teresa$ was frivolous and coquettish and thus the embroidery and muslins the cashmere waist girdles all dazzled her and the reflection of sapphires and #diamond# almost turned her giddy brain
$teresa$ felt a flush pass over her #face# she looked at $luigi_vampa$ who could not refuse his assent $luigi_vampa$ felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his #mind#
he followed with his #eye# each movement of $teresa$ and her cavalier when their #hand# touched he felt as though he should swoon every pulse beat with violence and it seemed as though a bell were ringing in his ears
when they spoke although $teresa$ listened timidly and with downcast #eye# to the #conversation# of her cavalier as $luigi_vampa$ could read in the ardent #look# of the good looking young #man# that his language was that of praise it seemed as if the whole #world# was turning round with him and all the #voice# of hell were whispering in his ears #idea# of murder and assassination
then fearing that his paroxysm might get the better of him he clutched with #one# #hand# the branch of a #tree# against which he was leaning and with the #other# convulsively grasped the dagger with a carved handle which was in his belt and which unwittingly he drew from the scabbard from #time# to #time#
it was like an acute pain which gnawed at his #heart# and then thrilled through his whole #body# $luigi_vampa$ was jealous
he felt that influenced by her ambitions and coquettish disposition $teresa$ might escape him the young peasant #girl# at first timid and scared soon recovered herself
we have said that $teresa$ was handsome but this is not all $teresa$ was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more potent than our affected and studied elegancies
she had almost all the #honor# of the quadrille and if she were envious of the #count# of san felice #daughter# we #will# not undertake to say that $carmela$ was not jealous of her
and with overpowering compliments her handsome cavalier led her back to the #place# whence he had taken her and where $luigi_vampa$ awaited her
twice or thrice during the dance the young #girl# had glanced at $luigi_vampa$ and each #time# she saw that he was pale and that his #feature# were agitated once even the blade of his knife #half# drawn from its sheath had dazzled her #eye# with its sinister glare
the quadrille had been most perfect and it was evident there was a great demand for a repetition $carmela$ alone objecting to it but the #count# of san felice besought his #daughter# so earnestly that she acceded
#one# of the cavaliers then hastened to invite $teresa$ without whom it was impossible for the quadrille to be formed but the young #girl# had disappeared
the #truth# was that $luigi_vampa$ had not felt the #strength# to support another such trial and #half# by persuasion and #half# by force he had removed $teresa$ toward another #part# of the #garden#
$teresa$ had yielded in #spite# of herself but when she looked at the agitated #countenance# of the young #man# she understood by his #silence# and trembling #voice# that #something# strange was passing within him
she herself was not exempt from internal #emotion# and without having done #anything# wrong yet fully comprehended that $luigi_vampa$ was #right# in reproaching her
thus it was almost tremblingly that she resumed her lover #arm# why she did not know but yet she did not the less feel that these reproaches were merited
however to $teresa$ great #astonishment# $luigi_vampa$ remained mute and not a #word# escaped his #lip# the #rest# of the #evening#
when the chill of the #night# had driven away the #guest# from the #garden# and the #gate# of the villa were closed on them for the festa in #door# he took $teresa$ quite away and as he left her at her home he said
i #thought# replied the young #girl# with all the frankness of her #nature# that i would give #half# my #life# for a #costume# such as she wore
$teresa$ what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the young #countess# of san felice
and what said your cavalier to you he said it only depended on myself to have it and i had only #one# #word# to say
he was #right# said $luigi_vampa$ do you #desire# it as ardently as you say yes
the young #girl# much astonished raised her #head# to #look# at him but his #face# was so gloomy and terrible that her #word# froze to her #lip#
$teresa$ followed him with her #eye# into the #darkness# as long as she could and when he had quite disappeared she went into the $house_of_peers$ with a sigh
that #night# a memorable #event# occurred due no #doubt# to the imprudence of some #servant# who had neglected to extinguish the #light#
well then you shall have it as $luigi_vampa$ spoke thus he left her the villa of san felice took #fire# in the #room# adjoining the very #apartment# of the lovely $carmela$
awakened in the #night# by the #light# of the flames she sprang out of #bed# wrapped herself in a dressing gown and attempted to escape by the #door# but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already a prey to the flames
she then returned to her #room# calling for help as loudly as she could when suddenly her #window# which was twenty #foot# from the #ground# was opened a young peasant jumped into the #chamber# seized her in his #arm# and with superhuman skill and #strength# conveyed her to the turf of the grass plot where she fainted
an entire wing of the villa was burnt down but what of that as long as $carmela$ was safe and uninjured
her preserver was everywhere sought for but he did not appear he was inquired after but no #one# had seen him
when she recovered her #father# was by her #side# all the #servant# surrounded her offering her assistance $carmela$ was greatly troubled that she had not recognized him
as the #count# was immensely rich excepting the danger $carmela$ had run and the marvellous #manner# in which she had escaped made that appear to him rather a favor of providence than a real #misfortune# the loss occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle
the next #day# at the usual #hour# the two young peasants were on the borders of the forest $luigi_vampa$ arrived first
the young #girl# was very pensive but seeing $luigi_vampa$ so cheerful she on her #part# assumed a smiling #air# which was natural to her when she was not excited or in a passion
he came toward $teresa$ in high spirits and seemed to have completely forgotten the #event# of the previous #evening# $luigi_vampa$ took her #arm# beneath his own and led her to the #door# of the grotto
then he paused the young #girl# perceiving that there was #something# extraordinary looked at him steadfastly $teresa$ said $luigi_vampa$
#yesterday# #evening# you told me you would give all the #world# to have a #costume# similar to that of the #count# #daughter#
yes replied $teresa$ with #astonishment# but i was mad to utter such a #wish#
and i replied very well you shall have it yes replied the young #girl# whose #astonishment# increased at every #word# uttered by $luigi_vampa$
but of #course# your reply was only to please me i have promised no more than i have given you $teresa$ said $luigi_vampa$ proudly
at these #word# he drew away the #stone# and showed $teresa$ the grotto lighted up by two wax #light# which burnt on each #side# of a splendid mirror on a rustic #table# made by $luigi_vampa$ were spread out the pearl necklace and the #diamond# pins and on a #chair# at the #side# was laid the #rest# of the #costume#
$teresa$ uttered a #cry# of #joy# and without inquiring whence this attire came or even thanking $luigi_vampa$ darted into the grotto transformed into a dressing #room#
$luigi_vampa$ pushed the #stone# behind her for on the crest of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward palestrina he saw a #traveller# on horseback stopping a #moment# as if uncertain of his #road# and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is peculiar to distant objects in southern climes
go into the grotto and dress yourself when he saw $luigi_vampa$ he put his #horse# into a gallop and advanced toward him
the #traveller# who was going from palestrina to tivoli had mistaken his #way# the young #man# directed him but as at a #distance# of a #quarter# of a mile the #road# again divided into three #way# and on reaching these the #traveller# might again stray from his route he begged $luigi_vampa$ to be his guide
$luigi_vampa$ threw his cloak on the #ground# placed his carbine on his #shoulder# and freed from his heavy covering preceded the #traveller# with the rapid #step# of a mountaineer which a #horse# can scarcely keep up with
on arriving there with an #air# as majestic as that of an emperor he stretched his #hand# towards that #one# of the #road# which the #traveller# was to follow
$luigi_vampa$ was not mistaken in ten #minute# $luigi_vampa$ and the #traveller# reached the cross #road# that is your #road# #excellency# and now you cannot again mistake
and here is your recompense said the #traveller# offering the young herdsman some small #piece# of #money#
#thank# you said $luigi_vampa$ #drawing# back his #hand# i render a #service# i do not sell it
well replied the #traveller# who seemed used to this difference between the servility of a #man# of the cities and the pride of the mountaineer
if you refuse wages you #will# perhaps accept a gift ah yes that is another #thing#
then said the #traveller# take these two venetian sequins and give them to your bride to make herself a pair of earrings
and then do you take this poniard said the young herdsman you #will# not find #one# better carved between albano and civita castellana
i accept it answered the #traveller# but then the obligation #will# be on my #side# for this poniard is worth more than two sequins
for a dealer perhaps but for me who engraved it myself it is hardly worth a piastre
what is your #name# inquired the #traveller# $luigi_vampa$ replied the shepherd with the same #air# as he would have replied alexander #king# of macedon
and yours i said the #traveller# am called sinbad the #sailor# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay started with surprise
sinbad the #sailor# he said yes replied the narrator that was the #name# which the #traveller# gave to $luigi_vampa$ as his own
inquired $m_albert_de_morcerf$ it is a very pretty #name# and the adventures of the #gentleman# of that #name# amused me very much in my youth i must confess
the #name# of sinbad the #sailor# as may well be supposed awakened in him a #world# of recollections as had the #name# of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ on the previous #evening#
well and what may you have to say against this #name# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ said no more proceed said he to the host
$luigi_vampa$ put the two sequins haughtily into his #pocket# and slowly returned by the #way# he had gone as he came within two or three hundred paces of the grotto he #thought# he heard a #cry#
he listened to know whence this #sound# could proceed a #moment# afterwards he #thought# he heard his own #name# pronounced distinctly
he bounded like a chamois cocking his carbine as he went and in a #moment# reached the summit of a hill opposite to that on which he had perceived the #traveller#
the #cry# proceeded from the grotto three #cry# for help came more distinctly to his ear he cast his #eye# around him and saw a #man# carrying off $teresa$ as nessus the centaur carried deianira
this #man# who was hastening towards the wood was already three #quarter# of the #way# on the #road# from the grotto to the forest
$luigi_vampa$ measured the #distance# the #man# was at least two hundred paces in advance of him and there was not a #chance# of overtaking him
the young shepherd stopped as if his #foot# had been rooted to the #ground# then he put the butt of his carbine to his #shoulder# took aim at the ravisher followed him for a second in his track and then fired
the ravisher stopped suddenly his knees bent under him and he fell with $teresa$ in his #arm# the young #girl# rose instantly but the #man# lay on the #earth# struggling in the agonies of #death#
$luigi_vampa$ then rushed towards $teresa$ for at ten paces from the dying #man# her legs had failed her and she had dropped on her knees so that the young #man# feared that the ball that had brought down his #enemy# had also wounded his betrothed
fortunately she was unscathed and it was fright alone that had overcome $teresa$ when $luigi_vampa$ had assured himself that she was safe and unharmed he turned towards the wounded #man#
he had just expired with clenched #hand# his mouth in a spasm of agony and his #hair# on #end# in the sweat of #death#
from the #day# on which the #bandit# had been saved by the two young peasants he had been enamoured of $teresa$ and had sworn she should be his
from that #time# he had watched them and profiting by the #moment# when her lover had left her alone had carried her off and believed he at #length# had her in his #power# when the ball directed by the unerring skill of the young herdsman had pierced his #heart#
$luigi_vampa$ gazed on him for a #moment# without betraying the slightest #emotion# while on the #contrary# $teresa$ shuddering in every limb dared not approach the slain ruffian but by degrees and threw a hesitating #glance# at the dead #body# over the #shoulder# of her lover
his #eye# remained open and menacing $luigi_vampa$ approached the corpse and recognized cucumetto suddenly $luigi_vampa$ turned toward his mistress
ah said he good good you are dressed it is now my #turn# to dress myself $teresa$ was clothed from #head# to #foot# in the garb of the #count# of san felice #daughter#
if a second #traveller# had passed he would have seen a strange #thing# a shepherdess watching her flock clad in a cashmere grown with ear rings and necklace of pearls #diamond# pins and buttons of sapphires emeralds and rubies
he would no #doubt# have believed that he had returned to the #time# of florian and would have declared on reaching paris that he had met an alpine shepherdess seated at the #foot# of the sabine hill
$luigi_vampa$ took cucumetto #body# in his #arm# and conveyed it to the grotto while in her #turn# $teresa$ remained outside
at the #end# of a #quarter# of an #hour# $luigi_vampa$ quitted the grotto his #costume# was no less elegant than that of $teresa$
he wore a vest of garnet colored velvet with buttons of cut #gold# a silk waistcoat covered with embroidery a roman scarf tied round his neck a cartridge #box# worked with #gold# and red and green silk sky blue velvet breeches fastened above the knee with #diamond# buckles garters of deerskin worked with a thousand arabesques and a hat whereon hung ribbons of all colors two watches hung from his girdle and a splendid poniard was in his belt
$teresa$ uttered a #cry# of admiration $luigi_vampa$ in this attire resembled a painting by léopold robert or schnetz he had assumed the entire #costume# of cucumetto
the young #man# saw the #effect# produced on his betrothed and a #smile# of pride passed over his #lip#
now he said to $teresa$ are you ready to share my #fortune# whatever it may be oh yes exclaimed the young #girl# enthusiastically
and follow me wherever i go to the #world# #end# then take my #arm# and let us on we have no #time# to lose
the young #girl# did so without questioning her lover as to where he was conducting her for he appeared to her at this #moment# as handsome proud and powerful as a god
we need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known to $luigi_vampa$ he therefore went forward without a #moment# hesitation although there was no beaten track but he knew his path by looking at the #tree# and bushes and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an #hour# and a #half#
they went towards the forest and soon entered it at the #end# of this #time# they had reached the thickest #part# of the forest
$luigi_vampa$ took this wild #road# which enclosed between two ridges and shadowed by the tufted umbrage of the pines seemed but for the difficulties of its descent that path to avernus of which virgil speaks
$teresa$ had become alarmed at the wild and deserted #look# of the plain around her and pressed closely against her guide not uttering a syllable but as she saw him advance with even #step# and composed #countenance# she endeavored to repress her #emotion#
a torrent whose #bed# was dry led into a deep gorge suddenly about ten paces from them a #man# advanced from behind a #tree# and aimed at $luigi_vampa$
what then said $luigi_vampa$ raising his #hand# with a gesture of disdain while $teresa$ no longer able to restrain her alarm clung closely to him
not another #step# he said or you are a dead #man# do wolves rend each #other#
who are you inquired the sentinel i am $luigi_vampa$ shepherd of the san felice farm
what do you want i would speak with your #companion# who are in the glade at rocca bianca
$luigi_vampa$ smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the #part# of the #bandit# went before $teresa$ and continued to advance with the same firm and easy #step# as before
follow me then said the sentinel or as you know your #way# go first at the #end# of ten #minute# the #bandit# made them a #sign# to stop
the two young #person# obeyed then the #bandit# thrice imitated the #cry# of a crow a croak answered this signal
$luigi_vampa$ and $teresa$ again set forward as they went on $teresa$ clung tremblingly to her lover at the #sight# of weapons and the glistening of carbines through the #tree#
the retreat of rocca bianca was at the top of a small mountain which no #doubt# in former #day# had been a volcano an extinct volcano before the #day# when remus and romulus had deserted alba to come and found the city of rome
good said the sentry you may now go on $teresa$ and $luigi_vampa$ reached the summit and all at once found themselves in the #presence# of twenty #bandit#
here is a young #man# who seeks and #wish# to speak to you said the sentinel what has he to say
inquired the young #man# who was in command in the chief absence i #wish# to say that i am tired of a shepherd #life# was $luigi_vampa$ reply
ah i understand said the lieutenant and you seek admittance into our ranks welcome cried several #bandit# from ferrusino pampinara and anagni who had recognized $luigi_vampa$
yes but i came to ask #something# more than to be your #companion# and what may that be
inquired the #bandit# with #astonishment# i come to ask to be your #captain# said the young #man#
the #bandit# shouted with laughter and what have you done to aspire to this #honor# demanded the lieutenant
i have killed your chief cucumetto whose dress i now wear and i set #fire# to the villa san felice to procure a wedding dress for my betrothed
an #hour# afterwards $luigi_vampa$ was chosen #captain# vice cucumetto deceased well my dear $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ turning towards his #friend#
what think you of citizen $luigi_vampa$ i say he is a myth replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and never had an existence
and what may a myth be inquired $signor_pastrini$ the explanation would be too long my dear landlord replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$
and you say that signor $luigi_vampa$ exercises his profession at this #moment# in the environs of rome and with a boldness of which no #bandit# before him ever gave an example
why you see he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the plains the fishermen of the tiber and the smugglers of the coast
they seek for him in the mountains and he is on the #water# they follow him on the #water# and he is on the open #sea# then they pursue him and he has suddenly taken refuge in the #island# at giglio giannutri or $m_de_monte_cristo$ and when they hunt for him there he reappears suddenly at albano tivoli or la riccia
then the #police# have vainly tried to lay #hand# on him and how does he behave towards #traveller#
it depends on the #distance# he may be from the city whether he gives eight #hour# twelve #hour# or a #day# wherein to pay their ransom and when that #time# has elapsed he allows another #hour# grace
at the sixtieth #minute# of this #hour# if the #money# is not forthcoming he blows out the #prisoner# brains with a #pistol# shot or plants his dagger in his #heart# and that settles the #account#
alas his #plan# is very simple well $m_albert_de_morcerf$ inquired $m_franz_de_quesnel$ of his #companion# are you still disposed to go to the colosseum by the outer #wall#
quite so said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ if the #way# be picturesque the clock struck nine as the #door# opened and a coachman appeared
#excellency# said he the coach is ready well then said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ let us to the colosseum
by the porta del popolo or by the #street# your #excellency# by the #street# morbleu by the #street# cried $m_franz_de_quesnel$
ah my dear #fellow# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ rising and lighting his third cigar really i #thought# you had more courage
the colosseum $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had so managed his route that during the ride to the colosseum they passed not a single ancient ruin so that no preliminary impression interfered to mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to admire
the #road# selected was a continuation of the via sistina then by cutting off the #right# angle of the #street# in which stands santa maria maggiore and proceeding by the via urbana and san pietro in vincoli the #traveller# would find themselves directly opposite the colosseum
this itinerary possessed another great advantage that of leaving $m_franz_de_quesnel$ at full #liberty# to indulge his deep reverie upon the #subject# of $signor_pastrini$ #story# in which his mysterious host of $m_de_monte_cristo$ was so strangely mixed up
seated with folded #arm# in a #corner# of the #carriage# he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so lately listened to and to ask himself an interminable number of #question# touching its various #circumstance# without however arriving at a satisfactory reply to any of them
#one# #fact# more than the #rest# brought his #friend# sinbad the #sailor# back to his recollection and that was the mysterious #sort# of intimacy that seemed to exist between the brigands and the #sailor# and $signor_pastrini$ #account# of $luigi_vampa$ having found refuge on #board# the #vessel# of smugglers and fishermen reminded $m_franz_de_quesnel$ of the two corsican #bandit# he had found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht which had even deviated from its #course# and touched at porto vecchio for the sole #purpose# of landing them
the very #name# assumed by his host of $m_de_monte_cristo$ and again repeated by the landlord of the hôtel de londres abundantly proved to him that his #island# #friend# was playing his philanthropic #part# on the shores of piombino civita vecchia ostia and gaëta as on those of corsica tuscany and spain and further $m_franz_de_quesnel$ bethought him of having heard his singular entertainer speak both of tunis and palermo proving thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended
but however the #mind# of the young #man# might be absorbed in these reflections they were at once dispersed at the #sight# of the dark frowning ruins of the stupendous colosseum through the various #opening# of which the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly gleam from the #eye# of the wandering dead
the #carriage# stopped near the meta sudans the #door# was opened and the young #man# eagerly alighting found themselves opposite a cicerone who appeared to have sprung up from the #ground# so unexpected was his #appearance#
the usual guide from the hotel having followed them they had paid two conductors nor is it possible at rome to avoid this abundant supply of guides besides the ordinary cicerone who seizes upon you directly you set #foot# in your hotel and never quits you while you remain in the city there is also a special cicerone belonging to each monument nay almost to each #part# of a monument
it may therefore be easily imagined there is no scarcity of guides at the colosseum that wonder of all #age# which martial thus eulogizes
let memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids and the wonders of babylon be talked of no more among us all must bow to the superiority of the gigantic labor of the cæsars and the many #voice# of fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable monument
as for $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and $m_franz_de_quesnel$ they essayed not to escape from their ciceronian tyrants and indeed it would have been so much the more difficult to break their bondage as the guides alone are permitted to #visit# these monuments with torches in their #hand#
thus then the young #man# made no attempt at resistance but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves into the #care# and custody of their conductors
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the colosseum while his less favored #companion# trod for the first #time# in his #life# the classic #ground# forming the monument of flavius vespasian and to his credit be it spoken his #mind# even amid the glib loquacity of the guides was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he saw and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be formed save by such as have visited them and more especially by moonlight at which #time# the vast proportions of the building appear twice as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to #light# the horizon with a glow equal to the soft twilight of a western clime
scarcely therefore had the reflective $m_franz_de_quesnel$ walked a hundred #step# beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin when abandoning $m_albert_de_morcerf$ to the guides who would by no #mean# yield their prescriptive #right# of carrying their victims through the routine regularly laid down and as regularly followed by them but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal beginning as a #matter# of #course# with the lions den the hall of the gladiators and finishing with $cæsar_borgia$ podium to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was surrounded $m_franz_de_quesnel$ ascended a #half# dilapidated #staircase# and leaving them to follow their monotonous round seated himself at the #foot# of a column and immediately opposite a large aperture which permitted him to enjoy a full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ had remained for nearly a #quarter# of an #hour# perfectly hidden by the #shadow# of the vast column at whose base he had found a resting #place# and from whence his #eye# followed the motions of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and his guides who holding torches in their #hand# had emerged from a vomitorium at the opposite extremity of the colosseum and then again disappeared down the #step# conducting to the #seat# reserved for the vestal virgins resembling as they glided along some restless shades following the flickering glare of so many ignes fatui
all at once his ear caught a #sound# resembling that of a #stone# rolling down the #staircase# opposite the #one# by which he had himself ascended
there was #nothing# remarkable in the #circumstance# of a fragment of granite giving #way# and falling heavily below but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave #way# beneath the pressure of a #foot# and also that someone who endeavored as much as possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard was approaching the #spot# where he sat
conjecture soon became certainty for the figure of a #man# was distinctly visible to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ gradually emerging from the #staircase# opposite upon which the moon was at that #moment# pouring a full tide of silvery brightness
the #stranger# thus presenting himself was probably a #person# who like $m_franz_de_quesnel$ preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own #thought# to the frivolous gabble of the guides
and his #appearance# had #nothing# extraordinary in it but the hesitation with which he proceeded stopping and listening with anxious #attention# at every #step# he took convinced $m_franz_de_quesnel$ that he expected the arrival of some #person#
so saying the two young #man# went down the #staircase# and got into the #carriage# #chapter# by a #sort# of instinctive impulse $m_franz_de_quesnel$ withdrew as much as possible behind his pillar
about ten #foot# from the #spot# where he and the #stranger# were the roof had given #way# leaving a large round #opening# through which might be seen the blue vault of heaven thickly studded with stars
around this #opening# which had possibly for #age# permitted a free entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile grew a quantity of creeping plants whose delicate green branches stood out in bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament while large masses of thick strong fibrous shoots forced their #way# through the chasm and hung floating to and fro like so many waving strings
the #person# whose mysterious arrival had attracted the #attention# of $m_franz_de_quesnel$ stood in a kind of #half# #light# that rendered it impossible to distinguish his #feature# although his dress was easily made out
he wore a large brown mantle #one# fold of which thrown over his left #shoulder# served likewise to mask the lower #part# of his #countenance# while the upper #part# was completely hidden by his broad brimmed hat
the lower #part# of his dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon which entering through the broken ceiling shed their refulgent beams on #foot# cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather over which descended fashionably cut trousers of black cloth
from the imperfect #mean# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had of judging he could only come to #one# conclusion that the #person# whom he was thus watching certainly belonged to no inferior station of #life#
some few #minute# had elapsed and the #stranger# began to show manifest #sign# of impatience when a slight #noise# was heard outside the aperture in the roof and almost immediately a dark #shadow# seemed to obstruct the flood of #light# that had entered it and the figure of a #man# was clearly seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him then as his #eye# caught #sight# of him in the mantle he grasped a floating mass of thickly matted boughs and glided down by their help to within three or four #foot# of the #ground# and then leaped lightly on his #foot#
the #man# who had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the transtevere #costume# i beg your #excellency#
but i dont think i many #minute# after my #time# ten clock has just struck by the clock of saint john lateran
pardon for keeping you waiting said the #man# in the roman dialect say not a #word# about being late replied the #stranger# in purest tuscan
but even if you had caused me to wait a little while i should have felt quite sure that the delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours
i came here direct from the castle of st angelo and i had an immense deal of trouble before i could get a #chance# to speak to $beppo$
tis i who am too soon your #excellency# is perfectly #right# in so thinking said the #man#
oh $beppo$ is employed in the #prison# and i give him so much a #year# to let me know what is going on within his holiness castle
and who is $beppo$ indeed you are a provident #person# i see why you see no #one# knows what may happen
perhaps some of these #day# i may be entrapped like poor $peppino$ and may be very glad to have some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net and so help me out of #prison#
that two executions of considerable #interest# #will# take #place# the #day# after #tomorrow# at two clock as is customary at rome at the commencement of all great festivals
#one# of the culprits #will# be mazzolato he is an atrocious villain who murdered the #priest# who brought him up and deserves not the smallest #pity#
briefly what did you learn the #other# sufferer is sentenced to be decapitato and he your #excellency# is poor $peppino$
the #fact# is that you have inspired not only the pontifical government but also the neighboring states with such extreme #fear# that they are glad of all opportunity of making an example
but $peppino$ did not even belong to my band he was merely a poor shepherd whose only #crime# consisted in furnishing us with provisions
but mark the distinction with which he is treated instead of being knocked on the #head# as you would be if once they caught hold of you he is simply sentenced to be guillotined by which #mean# too the amusements of the #day# are diversified and there is a spectacle to please every spectator
which makes him your accomplice to all intents and #purpose# without reckoning the wholly unexpected #one# i am preparing to surprise them with
my good #friend# said the #man# in the cloak excuse me for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild or extravagant act
perhaps i am but #one# #thing# i have resolved on and that is to stop at #nothing# to restore a poor devil to #liberty# who has got into this scrape solely from having served me
i should hate and despise myself as a coward did i desert the brave #fellow# in his present extremity
to surround the scaffold with twenty of my best #man# who at a signal from me #will# rush forward directly $peppino$ is brought for execution and by the assistance of their stilettos drive back the guard and carry off the #prisoner#
and what do you #mean# to do that seems to me as hazardous as uncertain and convinces me that my scheme is far better than yours
i #will# so advantageously bestow piastres that the #person# receiving them shall obtain a respite till next #year# for $peppino$ and during that #year# another skilfully placed piastres #will# afford him the #mean# of escaping from his #prison#
and what is your #excellency# project just this and do you feel sure of succeeding $pardieu$
exclaimed the #man# in the cloak suddenly expressing himself in french what did your #excellency# say inquired the #other#
i said my good #fellow# that i would do more single handed by the #mean# of #gold# than you and all your troop could #effect# with stilettos #pistol# carbines and blunderbusses included
leave me then to act and have no #fear# for the result at least there can be no harm in myself and party being in readiness in #case# your #excellency# should fail
take what precautions you please if it is any satisfaction to you to do so but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve i seek
none whatever remember the execution is fixed for the #day# after #tomorrow# and that you have but #one# #day# to #work# in
and what of that is not a #day# divided into twenty four #hour# each #hour# into sixty #minute# and every #minute# sub divided into sixty seconds
now in seconds very many #thing# can be done and how shall i know whether your #excellency# has succeeded or not
i have engaged the three lower #window# at the café rospoli should i have obtained the requisite pardon for $peppino$ the two outside #window# #will# be hung with yellow damasks and the centre with white having a large cross in red marked on it
oh that is very easily arranged and whom #will# you employ to carry the reprieve to the #officer# directing the execution
his dress #will# procure him the #mean# of approaching the scaffold itself and he #will# deliver the official #order# to the #officer# who in his #turn# #will# #hand# it to the executioner in the meantime it #will# be as well to acquaint $peppino$ with what we have determined on if it be only to prevent his dying of #fear# or losing his senses because in either #case# a very useless expense #will# have been incurred
send #one# of your #man# disguised as a penitent friar and i #will# give it to him your #excellency# said the #man# you are fully persuaded of my entire devotion to you are you not
nay i flatter myself that there can be no #doubt# of it replied the cavalier in the cloak
well then only fulfil your #promise# of rescuing $peppino$ and henceforward you shall receive not only devotion but the most absolute obedience from myself and those under me that #one# human being can render to another
have a #care# how far you pledge yourself my good #friend# for i may remind you of your #promise# at some perhaps not very distant period when i in my #turn# may require your aid and influence
let that #day# come sooner or later your #excellency# #will# find me what i have found you in this my heavy trouble and if from the #other# #end# of the #world# you but write me #word# to do such or such a #thing# you may regard it as done for done it shall be on the #word# and faith of
hush interrupted the #stranger# i hear a #noise# tis some #traveller# who are visiting the colosseum by torchlight
twere better we should not be seen together those guides are #nothing# but spies and might possibly recognize you and however i may be honored by your friendship my worthy #friend# if once the extent of our intimacy were known i am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit would suffer thereby
well then if you obtain the reprieve the middle #window# at the café rospoli #will# be hung with white damask bearing a red cross
and then my good #fellow# #use# your daggers in any #way# you please and i further #promise# you to be there as a spectator of your prowess
and if you fail then all three #window# #will# have yellow draperies and then
saying these #word# the transteverin disappeared down the #staircase# while his #companion# muffling his #feature# more closely than before in the folds of his mantle passed almost close to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and descended to the arena by an outward flight of #step#
the next #minute# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ heard himself called by $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who made the lofty building re echo with the #sound# of his #friend# #name#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ however did not obey the summons till he had satisfied himself that the two #man# whose #conversation# he had overheard were at a sufficient #distance# to prevent his encountering them in his descent
in ten #minute# after the #stranger# had departed $m_franz_de_quesnel$ was on the #road# to the piazza di spagna listening with studied indifference to the learned dissertation delivered by $m_albert_de_morcerf$ after the #manner# of pliny and calpurnius touching the #iron# pointed nets used to prevent the ferocious beasts from springing on the spectators
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ let him proceed without interruption and in #fact# did not hear what was said he longed to be alone and free to ponder over all that had occurred
#one# of the two #man# whose mysterious meeting in the colosseum he had so unintentionally witnessed was an entire #stranger# to him but not so the #other# and though $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had been unable to distinguish his #feature# from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the #shadow# the #tone# of his #voice# had made too powerful an impression on him the first #time# he had heard them for him ever again to forget them hear them when or where he might
it was more especially when this #man# was speaking in a #manner# #half# jesting #half# bitter that $m_franz_de_quesnel$ ear recalled most vividly the deep sonorous yet well pitched #voice# that had addressed him in the grotto of $m_de_monte_cristo$ and which he heard for the second #time# amid the #darkness# and ruined grandeur of the colosseum
and the more he #thought# the more entire was his conviction that the #person# who wore the mantle was no #other# than his former host and entertainer
we understand each #other# perfectly then adieu your #excellency# depend upon me as firmly as i do upon you sinbad the #sailor#
under any #other# #circumstance# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ would have found it impossible to resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage and with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance but in the present instance the confidential #nature# of the #conversation# he had overheard made him with propriety judge that his #appearance# at such a #time# would be #anything# but agreeable
as we have seen therefore he permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition but fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance should #chance# afford him another opportunity
in vain did $m_franz_de_quesnel$ endeavor to forget the many perplexing #thought# which assailed him in vain did he #court# the refreshment of sleep
slumber refused to #visit# his eyelids and the #night# was passed in feverish contemplation of the chain of #circumstance# tending to prove the identity of the mysterious visitant to the colosseum with the inhabitant of the grotto of $m_de_monte_cristo$ and the more he #thought# the firmer grew his #opinion# on the #subject#
worn out at #length# he fell asleep at daybreak and did not awake till late like a genuine frenchman $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had employed his #time# in arranging for the #evening#
diversion he had sent to engage a #box# at the teatro argentina and $m_franz_de_quesnel$ having a number of #letter# to write relinquished the #carriage# to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ for the whole of the #day#
at five clock $m_albert_de_morcerf$ returned delighted with his #day# #work# he had been occupied in leaving his #letter# of introduction and had received in #return# more invitations to balls and routs than it would be possible for him to accept besides this he had seen as he called it all the remarkable #sight# at rome
neither had he neglected to ascertain the #name# of the #piece# to be played that #night# at the teatro argentina and also what performers appeared in it
yes in a single #day# he had accomplished what his more serious minded #companion# would have taken weeks to #effect# the opera of parisina was announced for representation and the principal actors were coselli moriani and la specchia
the young #man# therefore had #reason# to consider themselves fortunate in having the opportunity of hearing #one# of the best #work# by the composer of lucia di lammermoor supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of italy
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ had never been able to endure the italian theatres with their orchestras from which it is impossible to see and the absence of balconies or open #box# all these defects pressed hard on a #man# who had had his stall at the bouffes and had shared a lower #box# at the opera
still in #spite# of this $m_albert_de_morcerf$ displayed his most dazzling and effective #costume# each #time# he visited the theatres but alas his elegant toilet was wholly thrown away and #one# of the most worthy representatives of parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he had nearly overrun italy without meeting with a single adventure
sometimes $m_albert_de_morcerf$ would affect to make a joke of his want of success but internally he was deeply wounded and his self #love# immensely piqued to think that $m_albert_de_morcerf$ the most admired and most sought after of any young #person# of his #day# should thus be passed over and merely have his labor for his pains
and the #thing# was so much the more annoying as according to the characteristic modesty of a frenchman $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in italy to carry all before him and that upon his #return# he should astonish the parisian #world# with the recital of his numerous #love# #affair#
none of those interesting adventures fell in his #way# the lovely genoese florentines and neapolitans were all faithful if not to their #husband# at least to their lovers and #thought# not of changing even for the splendid #appearance# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and all he gained was the painful conviction that the #lady# of italy have this advantage over those of france that they are faithful even in their infidelity
yet he could not restrain a #hope# that in italy as elsewhere there might be an exception to the general rule
alas poor $m_albert_de_morcerf$ albert besides being an elegant well looking young #man# was also possessed of considerable talent and ability moreover he was
a viscount a recently created #one# certainly but in the present #day# it is not necessary to go as far back as noah in tracing a descent and a genealogical #tree# is equally estimated whether dated from or merely but to crown all these advantages $m_albert_de_morcerf$ commanded an income of livres a more than sufficient #sum# to render him a personage of considerable importance in paris
it was therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling observation
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ however hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences during the carnival knowing full well that among the different states and kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated rome is the #spot# where even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their #life# and deign to mingle in the follies of this #time# of #liberty# and relaxation
the carnival was to commence on the morrow therefore $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had not an #instant# to lose in setting forth the programme of his #hope# expectations and claims to notice
with this design he had engaged a #box# in the most conspicuous #part# of the theatre and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most rich and elaborate toilet
the #box# taken by $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was in the first circle although each of the three tiers of #box# is deemed equally aristocratic and is for this #reason# generally styled the nobility #box# and although the #box# engaged for the two #friend# was sufficiently capacious to contain at least a dozen #person# it had cost less than would be paid at some of the french theatres for #one# admitting merely four occupants
another motive had influenced $m_albert_de_morcerf$ selection of his #seat# who knew but that thus advantageously placed he might not in #truth# attract the notice of some fair roman and an introduction might ensue that would procure him the offer of a #seat# in a #carriage# or a #place# in a princely balcony from which he might behold the gayeties of the carnival
totally disregarding the #business# of the stage he leaned from his #box# and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of each pretty #woman# aided by a powerful opera #glass# but alas this attempt to attract notice wholly failed not even curiosity had been excited and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures into whose good graces he was desirous of stealing were all so much engrossed with themselves their lovers or their own #thought# that they had not so much as noticed him or the manipulation of his #glass#
the #truth# was that the anticipated #pleasure# of the carnival with the holy week that was to succeed it so filled every fair breast as to prevent the least #attention# being bestowed even on the #business# of the stage
the actors made their entries and exits unobserved or unthought of at certain conventional #moment# the spectators would suddenly cease their #conversation# or rouse themselves from their musings to listen to some brilliant #effort# of moriani a well executed recitative by coselli or to join in loud applause at the wonderful #power# of la specchia but that momentary excitement over they quickly relapsed into their former state of preoccupation or interesting #conversation#
towards the close of the first act the #door# of a #box# which had been hitherto vacant was opened a #lady# entered to whom $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had been introduced in paris where indeed he had imagined she still was
the quick #eye# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ caught the involuntary start with which his #friend# beheld the new arrival and turning to him he said hastily
these united considerations made $m_albert_de_morcerf$ more lively and anxious to please than he had hitherto been do you know the #woman# who has just entered that #box#
yes what do you think of her oh she is perfectly lovely what a complexion and such magnificent #hair#
is she french no a venetian and her #name# is #countess# ah i know her by #name#
exclaimed $m_albert_de_morcerf$ she is said to possess as much wit and cleverness as beauty i was to have been presented to her when i met her at #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ ball
my dear #fellow# are you really on such good terms with her as to venture to take me to her #box#
why i have only had the #honor# of being in her society and conversing with her three or four #time# in my #life# but you know that even such an acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask
at that #instant# the #countess# perceived $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and graciously waved her #hand# to him to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the #head#
shall i assist you in repairing your negligence asked $m_franz_de_quesnel$ upon my #word# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ you seem to be on excellent terms with the beautiful #countess#
but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our countrymen to commit the most egregious blunders i
#mean# that of judging the habits and customs of italy and spain by our parisian notions believe me #nothing# is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among #person# by the familiar terms they seem upon there is a similarity of #feeling# at this #instant# between ourselves and the #countess# #nothing# more
you are mistaken in thinking so returned $m_franz_de_quesnel$ calmly is there indeed my good #fellow# pray tell me is it sympathy of #heart#
no of taste continued $m_franz_de_quesnel$ gravely and in what #manner# has this congeniality of #mind# been evinced by the #countess# visiting the colosseum as we did last #night# by moonlight and nearly alone
you were with her then i was and what did you say to her oh we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin is a glorious monument
you must have been a very entertaining #companion# alone or all but alone with a beautiful #woman# in such a #place# of sentiment as the colosseum and yet to find #nothing# better to talk about than the dead
upon my #word# cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$ all i can say is if ever i should get such a #chance# the living should be my theme m
and you #will# probably find your theme ill chosen but said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ breaking in upon his discourse never #mind# the past let us only remember the present
are you not going to keep your #promise# of introducing me to the fair #subject# of our remarks certainly directly the curtain falls on the stage
what a confounded long #time# this first act lasts i believe on my soul that they never #mean# to finish it
oh yes they #will# only listen to that charming finale how exquisitely coselli sings his #part# but what an awkward inelegant #fellow# he is
well then what do you say to la specchia did you ever see #anything# more perfect than her acting
why you know my dear #fellow# when #one# has been accustomed to malibran and sontag such singers as these dont make the same impression on you they perhaps do on #other#
at least you must admire moriani style and execution i never fancied #man# of his dark ponderous #appearance# singing with a #voice# like a #woman#
my good #friend# said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ turning to him while $m_albert_de_morcerf$ continued to #point# his #glass# at every #box# in the theatre
the curtain at #length# fell on the performances to the infinite satisfaction of the viscount of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who seized his hat rapidly passed his #finger# through his #hair# arranged his cravat and wristbands and signified to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ that he was waiting for him to lead the #way#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ who had mutely interrogated the #countess# and received from her a gracious #smile# in token that he would be welcome sought not to retard the gratification of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ eager impatience but began at once the tour of the $house_of_peers$ closely followed by $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who availed himself of the few #minute# required to reach the opposite #side# of the theatre to settle the height and smoothness of his collar and to arrange the lappets of his coat
you seem determined not to approve you are really too difficult to please this important task was just completed as they arrived at the #countess# #box#
at the knock the #door# was immediately opened and the young #man# who was seated beside the #countess# in obedience to the italian custom instantly rose and surrendered his #place# to the #stranger# who in #turn# would be expected to retire upon the arrival of #other# visitors
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ presented $m_albert_de_morcerf$ as #one# of the most distinguished young #man# of the #day# both as regarded his #position# in society and extraordinary talents nor did he say more than the #truth# for in paris and the circle in which the viscount moved he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ added that his #companion# deeply grieved at having been prevented the #honor# of being presented to the #countess# during her sojourn in paris was most anxious to make up for it and had requested him $m_franz_de_quesnel$ to remedy the past #misfortune# by conducting him to her #box# and concluded by asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do so
the #countess# in reply bowed gracefully to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and extended her #hand# with cordial kindness to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ then inviting $m_albert_de_morcerf$ to take the vacant #seat# beside her she recommended $m_franz_de_quesnel$ to take the next best if he wished to view the ballet and pointed to the #one# behind her own #chair#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon paris and parisian #matter# speaking to the #countess# of the various #person# they both knew there
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ perceived how completely he was in his element and unwilling to interfere with the #pleasure# he so evidently felt took up $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #glass# and began in his #turn# to survey the audience
sitting alone in the front of a #box# immediately opposite but situated on the third row was a #woman# of exquisite beauty dressed in a greek #costume# which evidently from the ease and grace with which she wore it was her national attire
behind her but in deep #shadow# was the outline of a masculine figure but the #feature# of this latter personage it was not possible to distinguish
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ could not forbear breaking in upon the apparently interesting #conversation# passing between the #countess# and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair albanian opposite since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by either sex
is that she has been at rome since the beginning of the season for i saw her where she now sits the very first #night# of the season and since then she has never missed a performance
sometimes she is accompanied by the #person# who is now with her and at #other# she is merely attended by a black #servant#
all i can tell about her replied the #countess# and what do you think of her personal #appearance#
oh i consider her perfectly lovely she is just my #idea# of what medora must have been
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ and the #countess# exchanged a #smile# and then the latter resumed her #conversation# with $m_albert_de_morcerf$ while $m_franz_de_quesnel$ returned to his previous survey of the $house_of_peers$ and company
the curtain rose on the ballet which was #one# of those excellent specimens of the italian school admirably arranged and put on the stage by henri who has established for himself a great reputation throughout italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic art
#one# of those masterly productions of grace method and elegance in which the whole corps de ballet from the principal dancers to the humblest supernumerary are all engaged on the stage at the same #time# and a hundred and fifty #person# may be seen exhibiting the same attitude or elevating the same #arm# or leg with a simultaneous movement that would lead you to suppose that but #one# #mind# #one# act of volition influenced the moving mass
however much the ballet might have claimed his #attention# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ was too deeply occupied with the beautiful greek to take any #note# of it while she seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it her eager animated #look# contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of her #companion# who during the whole #time# the #piece# lasted never even moved not even when the furious crashing din produced by the trumpets cymbals and chinese bells sounded their loudest from the orchestra
of this he took no heed but was as far as #appearance# might be trusted enjoying soft repose and bright celestial #dream#
the ballet at #length# came to a close and the curtain fell amid the loud unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience
owing to the very judicious #plan# of dividing the two acts of the opera with a ballet the pauses between the performances are very short the singers in the opera having #time# to repose themselves and change their #costume# when necessary while the dancers are executing their pirouettes and exhibiting their graceful #step#
the overture to the second act began and at the first #sound# of the leader bow across his violin $m_franz_de_quesnel$ observed the sleeper slowly arise and approach the greek #girl# who turned around to say a few #word# to him and then leaning forward again on the railing of her #box# she became as absorbed as before in what was going on
the #countenance# of the #person# who had addressed her remained so completely in the shade that though $m_franz_de_quesnel$ tried his utmost he could not distinguish a single #feature#
the curtain rose and the #attention# of $m_franz_de_quesnel$ was attracted by the actors and his #eye# turned from the #box# containing the greek #girl# and her strange #companion# to watch the #business# of the stage
most of my readers are aware that the second act of parisina opens with the celebrated and effective duet in which parisina while sleeping betrays to azzo the #secret# of her #love# for ugo
the injured #husband# goes through all the #emotion# of jealousy until conviction seizes on his #mind# and then in a frenzy of rage and indignation he awakens his guilty #wife# to tell her that he knows her guilt and to threaten her with his vengeance
this duet is #one# of the most beautiful expressive and terrible conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of donizetti
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ now listened to it for the third #time# yet its #note# so tenderly expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched #husband# and #wife# give vent to their different #grief# and passions thrilled through the soul of $m_franz_de_quesnel$ with an #effect# equal to his first #emotion# upon hearing it
excited beyond his usual calm demeanor $m_franz_de_quesnel$ rose with the audience and was about to join the loud enthusiastic applause that followed but suddenly his #purpose# was arrested his #hand# fell by his #side# and the #half# uttered bravos expired on his #lip#
the occupant of the #box# in which the greek #girl# sat appeared to share the universal admiration that prevailed for he left his #seat# to stand up in front so that his #countenance# being fully revealed $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had no difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of $m_de_monte_cristo$ and the very same #person# he had encountered the preceding #evening# in the ruins of the colosseum and whose #voice# and figure had seemed so familiar to him
the ballet was called poliska all #doubt# of his identity was now at an #end# his singular host evidently resided at rome
the surprise and agitation occasioned by this full confirmation of $m_franz_de_quesnel$ former suspicion had no #doubt# imparted a corresponding #expression# to his #feature# for the #countess# after gazing with a puzzled #look# at his #face# burst into a fit of laughter and begged to know what had happened
i asked you a short #time# since if you knew any particulars respecting the albanian #lady# opposite i must now beseech you to inform me who and what is her #husband#
#countess# returned $m_franz_de_quesnel$ totally unheeding her raillery nay answered the #countess# i know no more of him than yourself
perhaps you never before noticed him what a #question# so truly french do you not know that we italians have #eye# only for the #man# we #love#
all i can say is continued the #countess# taking up the lorgnette and directing it toward the #box# in #question# that the #gentleman# whose history i am unable to furnish seems to me as though he had just been dug up he #look# more like a corpse permitted by some friendly grave digger to quit his tomb for a while and revisit this #earth# of ours than #anything# human
true replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ how ghastly pale he is oh he is always as colorless as you now see him said $m_franz_de_quesnel$
then you know him almost screamed the #countess# oh pray do for heaven sake tell us all about is he a vampire or a resuscitated corpse or what
and i can well understand said the #countess# shrugging up her beautiful #shoulder# as though an involuntary shudder passed through her veins
i fancy i have seen him before and i even think he recognizes me that those who have once seen that #man# #will# never be likely to forget him
the sensation experienced by $m_franz_de_quesnel$ was evidently not peculiar to himself another and wholly uninterested #person# felt the same unaccountable awe and misgiving
well inquired $m_franz_de_quesnel$ after the #countess# had a second #time# directed her lorgnette at the #box# what do you think of our opposite neighbor
this fresh allusion to byron drew a #smile# to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #countenance# although he could but allow that if #anything# was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires it would be the #presence# of such a #man# as the mysterious personage before him
why that he is no #other# than $lord_ruthven$ himself in a living form i must positively find out who and what he is said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ rising from his #seat#
no no cried the #countess# you must not leave me i depend upon you to escort me home oh indeed i cannot permit you to go
is it possible whispered $m_franz_de_quesnel$ that you entertain any #fear# i ll tell you answered the #countess# byron had the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires and even assured me that he had seen them
the description he gave me perfectly corresponds with the #feature# and character of the #man# before us oh he is the exact personification of what i have been led to expect
the coal black #hair# large bright glittering #eye# in which a wild unearthly #fire# seems burning the same ghastly paleness then observe too that the #woman# with him is altogether unlike all #other# of her sex
she is a foreigner a #stranger# nobody knows who she is or where she comes from no #doubt# she belongs to the same horrible race he does and is like himself a dealer in magical arts
i entreat of you not to go near him at least tonight and if #tomorrow# your curiosity still continues as great pursue your researches if you #will# but tonight you neither can nor shall
for that #purpose# i #mean# to keep you all to myself $m_franz_de_quesnel$ protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following #day# for many #reason#
listen to me said the #countess# and do not be so very headstrong i am going home i have a party at my $house_of_peers$ tonight and therefore cannot possibly remain till the #end# of the opera
now i cannot for #one# #instant# believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a #lady# your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it
there was #nothing# else left for $m_franz_de_quesnel$ to do but to take up his hat open the #door# of the #box# and offer the #countess# his #arm#
it was quite evident by her #manner# that her uneasiness was not feigned and $m_franz_de_quesnel$ himself could not resist a #feeling# of superstitious dread so much the stronger in him as it arose from a variety of corroborative recollections while the #terror# of the #countess# sprang from an instinctive belief originally created in her #mind# by the wild tales she had listened to till she believed them #truth#
upon arriving at her hotel $m_franz_de_quesnel$ perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company on the #contrary# her own #return# before the appointed #hour# seemed greatly to astonish the #servant#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ could even feel her #arm# tremble as he assisted her into the #carriage# excuse my little subterfuge said the #countess# in reply to her #companion# #half# reproachful observation on the #subject#
but that horrid #man# had made me feel quite uncomfortable and i longed to be alone that i might compose my startled #mind#
nay said she do not #smile# it ill accords with the #expression# of your #countenance# and i am sure it does not spring from your #heart#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ essayed to #smile# however #promise# me #one# #thing# what is it #promise# me
i say i #will# do #anything# you #desire# except relinquish my determination of finding out who this #man# is
i have more #reason# than you can imagine for desiring to know who he is from whence he came and whither he is going
where he comes from i am ignorant but i can readily tell you where he is going to and that is down below without the least #doubt#
well then you must give me your #word# to #return# immediately to your hotel and make no attempt to follow this #man# tonight
let us only speak of the #promise# you wished me to make said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ there are certain affinities between the #person# we quit and those we meet afterwards
pursue your chase after him #tomorrow# as eagerly as you please but never bring him near me if you would not see me die of #terror#
for heaven sake do not serve as a conductor between that #man# and me and now good #night# go to your #room# and try to sleep away all recollections of this #evening#
so saying the #countess# quitted $m_franz_de_quesnel$ leaving him unable to decide whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense or whether her #fear# and agitations were genuine
upon his #return# to the hotel $m_franz_de_quesnel$ found $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in his dressing gown and slippers listlessly extended on a sofa smoking a cigar
for my own #part# i am quite sure i shall not be able to close my #eye# my dear #fellow#
cried he springing up is it really you why i did not expect to see you before #tomorrow#
i am glad of this opportunity to tell you once and forever that you entertain a most erroneous notion concerning italian #woman#
i should have #thought# the continual failures you have met with in all your own #love# #affair# might have taught you better by this #time#
my dear $m_albert_de_morcerf$ replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ upon my soul these #woman# would puzzle the very devil to read them aright
why here they give you their #hand# they press yours in #return# they keep up a whispering #conversation# permit you to accompany them home
why if a parisian were to indulge in a #quarter# of these marks of flattering #attention# her reputation would be gone forever
where #sound# the si as dante writes put so little restraint on their #word# and actions is because they live so much in public and have really #nothing# to conceal
and the very #reason# why the #woman# of this fine #country# besides you must have perceived that the #countess# was really alarmed
at what at the #sight# of that respectable #gentleman# sitting opposite to us in the same #box# with the lovely greek #girl#
now for my #part# i met them in the lobby after the conclusion of the #piece# and hang me if i can guess where you took your notions of the #other# #world# from
indeed i feel quite sure from the cut of his clothes they are made by a first rate paris tailor probably blin or humann
he was rather too pale certainly but then you know paleness is always looked upon as a strong #proof# of aristocratic descent and distinguished breeding
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ smiled for he well remembered that $m_albert_de_morcerf$ particularly prided himself on the entire absence of color in his own complexion
i can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced fine looking #fellow# admirably dressed well that tends to confirm my own #idea# said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ that the #countess#
suspicions were destitute alike of sense and #reason# did he speak in your hearing and did you catch any of his #word#
i did but they were uttered in the romaic dialect i knew that from the mixture of greek #word#
i dont know whether i ever told you that when i was at college i was rather rather strong in greek
he spoke the romaic language did he i think so that settles it murmured $m_franz_de_quesnel$
tis he past all #doubt# what do you say #nothing# nothing but tell me what were you thinking about when i came in
oh i was arranging a little surprise for you indeed of what #nature# why you know it is quite impossible to procure a #carriage#
certainly and i also know that we have done all that human #mean# afforded to endeavor to get #one#
now then in this difficulty a bright #idea# has flashed across my brain $m_franz_de_quesnel$ looked at $m_albert_de_morcerf$ as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions of his imagination
you deserve to be called out for such a misgiving and incredulous #glance# as that you were pleased to bestow on me just now
and i #promise# to give you the satisfaction of a #gentleman# if your scheme #turn# out as ingenious as you assert
i tell you what $m_franz_de_quesnel$ cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$ well then hearken to me
i listen you agree do you not that obtaining a #carriage# is out of the #question# i do
neither can we procure #horse# true we have offered any #sum# but have failed well now what do you say to a cart
i dare say such a #thing# might be had very possibly and a pair of oxen
as easily found as the cart then you see my good #fellow# with a cart and a couple of oxen our #business# can be managed
the cart must be tastefully ornamented and if you and i dress ourselves as neapolitan reapers we may get up a striking tableau after the #manner# of that splendid picture by léopold robert
it would add greatly to the #effect# if the #countess# would join us in the #costume# of a peasant from puzzoli or sorrento
our group would then be quite complete more especially as the #countess# is quite beautiful enough to represent a madonna
well said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ this #time# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i am bound to give you credit for having hit upon a most capital #idea#
and quite a national #one# too replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with gratified pride a mere masque borrowed from our own festivities
you #thought# to make us unhappy #stranger# trot at the heels of your processions like so many lazzaroni because no #carriage# or #horse# are to be had in your beggarly city
ha ha ye romans but you dont know us when we cant have #one# #thing# we invent another and have you communicated your triumphant #idea# to anybody
only to our host upon my #return# home i sent for him and i then explained to him what i wished to procure
#one# #thing# i was sorry for when i bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded he told me there would not be #time# as it would require three #day# to do that
he assured me that #nothing# would be easier than to furnish all i desired so you see we must do without this little superfluity
and where is he now who our host gone out in search of our equipage by #tomorrow# it might be too late
then he #will# be able to give us an #answer# tonight oh i expect him every #minute#
at this #instant# the #door# opened and the #head# of $signor_pastrini$ appeared permesso inquired he certainly certainly cried $m_franz_de_quesnel$
come in my host now then asked $m_albert_de_morcerf$ eagerly have you found the desired cart and oxen
better than that replied $signor_pastrini$ with the #air# of a #man# perfectly well satisfied with himself take #care# my worthy host said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ better is a sure #enemy# to well
let your #excellency# only leave the #matter# to me returned $signor_pastrini$ in a #tone# indicative of unbounded self confidence
your #excellency# are aware responded the landlord swelling with importance that the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ is living on the same #floor# with yourselves
i should think we did know it exclaimed $m_albert_de_morcerf$ since it is owing to that #circumstance# that we are packed into these small #room# like two poor students in the back #street# of paris
when then the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ hearing of the dilemma in which you are placed has sent to offer you #seat# in his #carriage# and two #place# at his #window# in the palazzo rospoli
but what have you done asked $m_franz_de_quesnel$ speak out there a worthy #fellow#
the #friend# looked at each #other# with unutterable surprise but do you think asked $m_albert_de_morcerf$ that we ought to accept such offers from a perfect #stranger#
what #sort# of #person# is this #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ asked $m_franz_de_quesnel$ of his host a very great nobleman but whether maltese or sicilian
i cannot exactly say but this i know that he is noble as a borghese and rich as a #gold# mine
it seems to me said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ speaking in an undertone to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ that if this #person# merited the high panegyrics of our landlord he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious #way#
a #servant# wearing a livery of considerable style and richness appeared at the threshold and placing two cards in the landlord #hand# who forthwith presented them to the two young #man# he said please to deliver these from the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ to vicomte $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay
he would have written or at this #instant# someone knocked at the #door# come in said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ continued the #servant#
begs these #gentleman# permission to wait upon them as their neighbor and he #will# be honored by an intimation of what #time# they #will# please to receive him
faith $m_franz_de_quesnel$ whispered $m_albert_de_morcerf$ there is not much to find fault with here tell the #count# replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ that we #will# do ourselves the #pleasure# of calling on him
the #servant# bowed and retired that is what i call an elegant mode of attack said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ you were quite correct in what you said $signor_pastrini$
the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ is unquestionably a #man# of first rate breeding and knowledge of the #world# then you accept his offer said the host
of #course# we do replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ still i must own i am sorry to be obliged to give up the cart and the group of reapers
and were it not for the #window# at the palazzo rospoli by #way# of recompense for the loss of our beautiful scheme i dont know but what i should have held on by my original #plan#
it would have produced such an #effect# what say you $m_franz_de_quesnel$ oh i agree with you the #window# in the palazzo rospoli alone decided me
the #truth# was that the mention of two #place# in the palazzo rospoli had recalled to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ the #conversation# he had overheard the preceding #evening# in the ruins of the colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the transteverin in which the #stranger# in the cloak had undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal and if this muffled up individual proved as $m_franz_de_quesnel$ felt sure he would the same as the #person# he had just seen in the teatro argentina then he should be able to establish his identity and also to prosecute his researches respecting him with perfect facility and freedom
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ passed the #night# in confused #dream# respecting the two meetings he had already had with his mysterious tormentor and in waking speculations as to what the morrow would produce
the next #day# must clear up every #doubt# and unless his near neighbor and would be #friend# the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ possessed the ring of gyges and by its #power# was able to render himself invisible it was very certain he could not escape this #time#
eight clock found $m_franz_de_quesnel$ up and dressed while $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who had not the same motives for early rising was still soundly asleep
the first act of $m_franz_de_quesnel$ was to summon his landlord who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness pray $signor_pastrini$ asked $m_franz_de_quesnel$ is not some execution appointed to take #place# #today#
yes your #excellency# but if your #reason# for inquiry is that you may procure a #window# to view it from you are much too late
i had no such intention and even if i had felt a #wish# to witness the spectacle i might have done so from monte pincio
i did not think it likely your #excellency# would have chosen to mingle with such a rabble as are always collected on that hill which indeed they consider as exclusively belonging to themselves
oh no answered $m_franz_de_quesnel$ could i not ah exclaimed mine host
very possibly i may not go answered $m_franz_de_quesnel$ but in #case# i feel disposed give me some particulars of #today# executions
what particulars would your #excellency# like to hear why the number of #person# condemned to suffer their #name# and description of the #death# they are to die
that happens just lucky your #excellency# only a few #minute# ago they brought me the tavolettas
#sort# of wooden tablets hung up at the #corner# of #street# the #evening# before an execution on which is pasted up a #paper# containing the #name# of the condemned #person# their #crime# and mode of punishment
the #reason# for so publicly announcing all this is that all good and faithful catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits and above all beseech of heaven to grant them a sincere repentance
and these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers to those of the faithful are they asked $m_franz_de_quesnel$ somewhat incredulously
i have not #time# for anybody #affair# but my own and those of my honorable #guest# but i make an agreement with the #man# who pastes up the #paper# and he brings them to me as he would the playbills that in #case# any #person# staying at my hotel should like to witness an execution he may obtain every requisite information concerning the #time# and #place# etc
what are they oh dear no your #excellency# upon my #word# that is a most delicate #attention# on your #part# $signor_pastrini$ cried $m_franz_de_quesnel$
i think i may take upon myself to say i neglect #nothing# to deserve the support and patronage of the noble visitors to this poor hotel
i see that plainly enough my most excellent host and you may rely upon me to proclaim so striking a #proof# of your #attention# to your #guest# wherever i go
why your #excellency# returned the landlord chuckling and rubbing his #hand# with infinite complacency meanwhile oblige me by a #sight# of #one# of these tavolettas
#nothing# can be easier than to comply with your #excellency# #wish# said the landlord #opening# the #door# of the #chamber#
i have caused #one# to be placed on the landing close by your #apartment# then taking the tablet from the #wall# he handed it to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ who read as follows
the public is informed that on wednesday february rd being the first #day# of the carnival executions #will# take #place# in the piazza del popolo by #order# of the tribunal of the rota of two #person# named $andrea_rondolo$ and $peppino$ otherwise called rocca priori the former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary #priest# named don césar torlini canon of the church of st john lateran and the latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary #bandit# $luigi_vampa$ and his band
the prayers of all good christians are entreated for these unfortunate #man# that it may please god to awaken them to a sense of their guilt and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their #crime#
the first named malefactor #will# be mazzolato the second culprit decapitato this was precisely what $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had heard the #evening# before in the ruins of the colosseum
no #part# of the programme differed the #name# of the condemned #person# their #crime# and mode of punishment all agreed with his previous information
in all probability therefore the transteverin was no #other# than the #bandit# $luigi_vampa$ himself and the #man# shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as sinbad the #sailor# but who no #doubt# was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in rome as he had already done at porto vecchio and tunis
#time# was getting on however and $m_franz_de_quesnel$ deemed it advisable to awaken $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but at the #moment# he prepared to proceed to his #chamber# his #friend# entered the #room# in perfect #costume# for the #day#
the anticipated delights of the carnival had so run in his #head# as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual #hour#
now my excellent $signor_pastrini$ said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ addressing his landlord since we are both ready do you think we may proceed at once to #visit# the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ is always an early riser and i can #answer# for his having been up these two #hour#
most assuredly replied he then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our respects to him directly
oh i am quite sure i #will# take all the blame on myself if you find i have led you into an error
well then if it be so are you ready $m_albert_de_morcerf$ perfectly let us go and #return# our best #thank# for his courtesy
the landlord preceded the #friend# across the landing which was all that separated them from the #apartment# of the #count# rang at the bell and upon the #door# being opened by a #servant# said
yes let us do so i signori francesi the domestic bowed respectfully and invited them to enter
they passed through two #room# furnished in a luxurious #manner# they had not expected to see under the roof of $signor_pastrini$ and were shown into an elegantly fitted up #drawing# #room#
the richest turkey carpets covered the #floor# and the softest and most inviting couches easy #chair# and sofas offered their high piled and yielding cushions to such as desired repose or refreshment
splendid paintings by the first #master# were ranged against the #wall# intermingled with magnificent trophies of war while heavy curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before the different #door# of the #room#
if your #excellency# #will# please to be seated said the #man# i #will# let the #count# know that you are here
as the #door# opened the #sound# of a guzla reached the ears of the young #man# but was almost immediately lost for the rapid closing of the #door# merely allowed #one# rich swell of harmony to enter
and with these #word# he disappeared behind #one# of the tapestried portières $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ looked inquiringly at each #other# then at the gorgeous furnishings of the #apartment#
#everything# seemed more magnificent at a second view than it had done at their first rapid survey well said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ to his #friend#
why upon my soul my dear #fellow# it strikes me that our elegant and attentive neighbor must either be some successful stock jobber who has speculated in the fall of the spanish funds or some prince travelling incog
what think you of all this hush hush replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ we shall ascertain who and what he is
as $m_franz_de_quesnel$ spoke he heard the #sound# of a #door# turning on its hinges and almost immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside and the owner of all these riches stood before the two young #man#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ instantly rose to meet him but $m_franz_de_quesnel$ remained in a #manner# spellbound on his #chair# for in the #person# of him who had just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the colosseum and the occupant of the #box# at the teatro argentina but also his extraordinary host of $m_de_monte_cristo$
i pray you excuse me for suffering my #visit# to be anticipated but i feared to disturb you by presenting myself earlier at your #apartment# besides you sent me #word# that you would come to me and i have held myself at your disposal
he comes #chapter# la mazzolata #gentleman# said the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ as he entered $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and i have to #thank# you a thousand #time# #count# returned $m_albert_de_morcerf$
you extricated us from a great dilemma and we were on the #point# of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly invitation reached us
indeed returned the #count# motioning the two young #man# to sit down it was the fault of that blockhead $signor_pastrini$ that i did not sooner assist you in your distress
he did not mention a syllable of your embarrassment to me when he knows that alone and isolated as i am i seek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my neighbors
as soon as i learned i could in any #way# assist you i most eagerly seized the opportunity of offering my #service#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ had as yet found #nothing# to say he had come to no determination and as #nothing# in the #count# #manner# manifested the #wish# that he should recognize him he did not know whether to make any allusion to the past or wait until he had more #proof# besides although sure it was he who had been in the #box# the previous #evening# he could not be equally positive that this was the #man# he had seen at the colosseum
the two young #man# bowed he resolved therefore to let #thing# take their #course# without making any direct overture to the #count#
moreover he had this advantage he was #master# of the #count# #secret# while the #count# had no hold on $m_franz_de_quesnel$ who had #nothing# to conceal
however he resolved to lead the #conversation# to a #subject# which might possibly clear up his #doubt# #count# said he you have offered us #place# in your #carriage# and at your #window# in the rospoli palace
ah said the #count# negligently looking attentively at $m_albert_de_morcerf$ is there not #something# like an execution upon the piazza del popolo
can you tell us where we can obtain a #sight# of the piazza del popolo yes returned $m_franz_de_quesnel$ finding that the #count# was coming to the #point# he wished
stay i think i told my steward #yesterday# to attend to this perhaps i can render you this slight #service# also
did you ever occupy yourself said he to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ with the employment of #time# and the #mean# of simplifying the summoning your #servant#
he extended his #hand# and rang the bell thrice i have when i ring once it is for my #valet# twice for my majordomo thrice for my steward thus
a #man# of about forty five or fifty entered exactly resembling the smuggler who had introduced $m_franz_de_quesnel$ into the cavern but he did not appear to recognize him
i do not waste a #minute# or a #word# here he is it was evident he had his #order#
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_bertuccio$ said the #count# you have procured me #window# looking on the piazza del popolo as i ordered you #yesterday#
yes #excellency# returned the steward but it was very late did i not tell you i wished for #one#
replied the #count# frowning and your #excellency# has #one# which was let to prince lobanieff but i was obliged to pay a hundred
that #will# do that #will# do $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_bertuccio$ spare these #gentleman# all such domestic arrangements you have the #window# that is sufficient
give #order# to the coachman and be in readiness on the stairs to conduct us to it the steward bowed and was about to quit the #room#
ah continued the #count# be good enough to ask $signor_pastrini$ if he has received the tavoletta and if he can send us an #account# of the execution
there is no need to do that said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ taking out his tablets for i saw the #account# and copied it down
very well you can retire $m_bertuccio$ i need you no longer let us know when breakfast is ready
these #gentleman# added he turning to the two #friend# #will# i trust do me the #honor# to breakfast with me
but my dear #count# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ we shall abuse your kindness not at all on the #contrary# you #will# give me great #pleasure#
you #will# #one# or #other# of you perhaps both #return# it to me at paris $m_bertuccio$ lay covers for three
he then took $m_franz_de_quesnel$ tablets out of his #hand# we announce he read in the same #tone# with which he would have read a newspaper
that #today# the rd of february #will# be executed $andrea_rondolo$ guilty of murder on the #person# of the respected and venerated don césar torlini canon of the church of st john lateran and $peppino$ called rocca priori convicted of complicity with the detestable #bandit# $luigi_vampa$ and the #man# of his band
it was at first arranged in this #way# but i think since #yesterday# some change has taken #place# in the #order# of the ceremony
hum the first #will# be mazzolato the second decapitato yes continued the #count#
yes i passed the #evening# at the cardinal rospigliosi and there mention was made of #something# like a pardon for #one# of the two #man#
really said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ for $andrea_rondolo$ asked $m_franz_de_quesnel$ no replied the #count# carelessly for the #other# he glanced at the tablets as if to recall the #name# for $peppino$ called rocca priori
you are thus deprived of seeing a #man# guillotined but the mazzolata still remains which is a very curious punishment when seen for the first #time# and even the second while the #other# as you must know is very simple
the mandaïa never fails never trembles never strikes thirty #time# ineffectually like the #soldier# who beheaded the #count# of chalais and to whose tender mercy richelieu had doubtless recommended the sufferer
ah added the #count# in a contemptuous #tone# do not tell me of european punishments they are in the infancy or rather the old #age# of cruelty
really #count# replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #one# would think that you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the #world#
there are at least few that i have not seen said the #count# coldly and you took #pleasure# in beholding these dreadful spectacles
my first sentiment was horror the second indifference the third curiosity curiosity that is a terrible #word# why so
in #life# our greatest preoccupation is #death# is it not then curious to #study# the different #way# by which the soul and #body# can #part# and how according to their different characters temperaments and even the different customs of their #country# different #person# bear the transition from #life# to #death# from existence to annihilation
as for myself i can assure you of #one# #thing# the more #man# you see die the easier it becomes to die yourself and in my #opinion# #death# may be a torture but it is not an expiation
i do not quite understand you replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ pray explain your meaning for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch
listen said the #count# and deep hatred mounted to his #face# as the #blood# would to the #face# of any #other#
if a #man# had by unheard of and excruciating tortures destroyed your #father# your #mother# your betrothed a being who when torn from you left a desolation a wound that never closes in your breast do
you think the reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal muscles of the murderer and allows him who has caused us #year# of moral sufferings to escape with a few #moment# of physical pain
yes i know said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ that human #justice# is insufficient to console us she can give #blood# in #return# for #blood# that is all but you must demand from her only what it is in her #power# to grant
i #will# put another #case# to you continued the #count# that where society attacked by the #death# of a #person# avenges #death# by #death#
but are there not a thousand tortures by which a #man# may be made to suffer without society taking the least cognizance of them or offering him even the insufficient #mean# of vengeance of which we have just spoken
are there not #crime# for which the impalement of the turks the augers of the persians the stake and the brand of the iroquois indians are inadequate tortures and which are unpunished by society
#answer# me do not these #crime# exist yes answered $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and it is to punish them that duelling is tolerated
ah duelling cried the #count# a pleasant #manner# upon my soul of arriving at your #end# when that #end# is vengeance
a #man# has carried off your mistress a #man# has seduced your #wife# a #man# has dishonored your #daughter# he has rendered the whole #life# of #one# who had the #right# to expect from heaven that portion of #happiness# god has promised to #everyone# of his creatures an existence of misery and infamy and you think you are avenged because you send a ball through the #head# or pass a sword through the breast of that #man# who has planted madness in your brain and #despair# in your #heart#
and remember moreover that it is often he who comes off victorious from the strife absolved of all #crime# in the #eye# of the #world#
no no continued the #count# had i to avenge myself it is not thus i would take revenge
then you disapprove of duelling you would not fight a duel asked $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in his #turn# astonished at this strange theory
understand me i would fight a duel for a trifle for an insult for a blow and the more so that #thank# to my skill in all bodily exercises and the indifference to danger i have gradually acquired i should be almost certain to kill my #man#
oh i would fight for such a cause but in #return# for a slow profound eternal torture i would give back the same were it possible an #eye# for an #eye# a tooth for a tooth as the orientalists say our #master# in #everything# those favored creatures who have formed for themselves a #life# of #dream# and a paradise of realities
but said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ to the #count# with this theory which renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause it would be difficult to adopt a #course# that would forever prevent your falling under the #power# of the #law#
hatred is blind rage carries you away and he who pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught
yes if he be poor and inexperienced not if he be rich and skilful besides the worst that could happen to him would be the punishment of which we have already spoken and which the philanthropic french revolution has substituted for being torn to #piece# by #horse# or broken on the wheel
on my #word# i almost regret that in all probability this miserable $peppino$ #will# not be beheaded as you might have had an opportunity then of seeing how short a #time# the punishment lasts and whether it is worth even mentioning but really this is a most singular #conversation# for the carnival #gentleman# how did it arise
ah i recollect you asked for a #place# at my #window# you shall have it but let us first sit down to #table# for here comes the #servant# to inform us that breakfast is ready
oh yes replied the #count# what #matter# this punishment as long as he is avenged
as he spoke a #servant# opened #one# of the four #door# of the #apartment# saying al suo commodo the two young #man# arose and entered the breakfast #room#
during the meal which was excellent and admirably served $m_franz_de_quesnel$ looked repeatedly at $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in #order# to observe the impressions which he doubted not had been made on him by the #word# of their entertainer but whether with his usual carelessness he had paid but little #attention# to him whether the explanation of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ with regard to duelling had satisfied him or whether the #event# which $m_franz_de_quesnel$ knew of had had their #effect# on him alone he remarked that his #companion# did not pay the least regard to them but on the #contrary# ate like a #man# who for the last four or five #month# had been condemned to partake of italian cookery
as for the #count# he just touched the dishes he seemed to fulfil the #duty# of a host by sitting down with his #guest# and awaited their departure to be served with some strange or more delicate food
this brought back to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ in #spite# of himself the recollection of the #terror# with which the #count# had inspired the #countess# and her firm conviction that the #man# in the opposite #box# was a vampire
that is the worst in the #world# at the #end# of the breakfast $m_franz_de_quesnel$ took out his watch well said the #count# what are you doing
you must excuse us #count# returned $m_franz_de_quesnel$ but we have still much to do what may that be
we have no masks and it is absolutely necessary to procure them do not concern yourself about that
we have i think a private #room# in the piazza del popolo i #will# have whatever #costume# you choose brought to us and you can dress there
after the execution cried $m_franz_de_quesnel$ before or after whichever you please opposite the scaffold the scaffold forms #part# of the fête
i #thank# you for your courtesy but i shall content myself with accepting a #place# in your #carriage# and at your #window# at the rospoli palace and i leave you at #liberty# to dispose of my #place# at the piazza del popolo
#count# i have reflected on the #matter# said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ but i warn you you #will# lose a very curious #sight# returned the #count#
you #will# describe it to me replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and the recital from your #lip# #will# make as great an impression on me as if i had witnessed it
i have more than once intended witnessing an execution but i have never been able to make up my #mind# and you $m_albert_de_morcerf$
i replied the viscount i saw castaing executed but i think i was rather intoxicated that #day# for i had quitted college the same #morning# and we had passed the previous #night# at a tavern
besides it is no #reason# because you have not seen an execution at paris that you should not see #one# anywhere else when you travel it is to see #everything#
think what a figure you #will# make when you are asked how do they execute at rome
and besides they say that the culprit is an infamous scoundrel who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought him up like his own #son#
when a churchman is killed it should be with a different weapon than a log especially when he has behaved like a #father#
and you reply i do not know diable if you went to spain would you not see the bull fights
well suppose it is a bull fight you are going to see recollect the ancient romans of the circus and the sports where they killed three hundred lions and a hundred #man#
think of the eighty thousand applauding spectators the sage matrons who took their #daughter# and the charming vestals who made with the thumb of their white #hand# the fatal #sign# that said come despatch the dying
shall you go then $m_albert_de_morcerf$ asked $m_franz_de_quesnel$ ma foi yes like you i hesitated but the #count# eloquence decides me
let us go then said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ since you #wish# it but on our #way# to the piazza del popolo i #wish# to pass through the corso
is this possible #count# on #foot# yes in a #carriage# no i #will# go on #foot# then
is it important that you should go that #way# yes there is #something# i #wish# to see
we #will# send the #carriage# to wait for us on the piazza del popolo by the via del babuino for i shall be glad to pass myself through the corso to see if some #order# i have given have been executed
well we #will# go by the corso #excellency# said a #servant# #opening# the #door# a #man# in the dress of a penitent #wish# to speak to you
ah yes returned the #count# i know who he is #gentleman# #will# you #return# to the salon you #will# find good cigars on the centre #table#
i #will# be with you directly the young #man# rose and returned into the salon while the #count# again apologizing left by another #door#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ who was a great smoker and who had considered it no small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the café de paris approached the #table# and uttered a #cry# of #joy# at perceiving some veritable puros
well asked $m_franz_de_quesnel$ what think you of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ what do i think said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ evidently surprised at such a #question# from his #companion#
i think he is a delightful #fellow# who does the #honor# of his #table# admirably who has travelled much read much is like brutus of the stoic school
such was $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #opinion# of the #count# and as $m_franz_de_quesnel$ well knew that $m_albert_de_morcerf$ professed never to form an #opinion# except upon long reflection he made no attempt to change it
and moreover added he sending a volume of smoke up towards the ceiling that he has excellent cigars
but said he did you observe #one# very singular #thing# what how attentively he looked at you
ah replied he sighing that is not very surprising i have been more than a #year# absent from paris and my clothes are of a most antiquated cut the #count# takes me for a provincial
at me yes $m_albert_de_morcerf$ reflected the first opportunity you have undeceive him i beg and tell him i am #nothing# of the kind
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ smiled an #instant# after the #count# entered i am now quite at your #service# #gentleman# said he
the #carriage# is going #one# #way# to the piazza del popolo and we #will# go another and if you please by the corso
take some more of these cigars de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with all my #heart# returned $m_albert_de_morcerf$ italian cigars are horrible
when you come to paris i #will# #return# all this i #will# not refuse i intend going there soon and since you allow me i #will# pay you a #visit#
come we have not any #time# to lose it is #half# past twelve let us set off all three descended the coachman received his #master# #order# and drove down the via del babuino
while the three #gentleman# walked along the piazza di spagna and the via frattina which led directly between the fiano and rospoli palaces $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #attention# was directed towards the #window# of that last palace for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the #man# in the mantle and the transtevere peasant
the three last returned he with a negligence evidently unaffected for he could not imagine with what intention the #question# was put
which are your #window# asked he of the #count# with as much indifference as he could assume $m_franz_de_quesnel$ glanced rapidly towards the three #window#
the #man# in the mantle had kept his #promise# to the transteverin and there could now be no #doubt# that he was the #count#
the #side# #window# were hung with yellow damask and the centre #one# with white damask and a red cross the three #window# were still untenanted
the masks could not appear the #carriage# could not move about but the masks were visible behind the #window# the #carriage# and the #door#
preparations were making on every #side# #chair# were placed scaffolds were raised and #window# were hung with flags $m_franz_de_quesnel$ $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and the #count# continued to descend the corso
as they approached the piazza del popolo the crowd became more dense and above the #head# of the multitude two objects were visible the obelisk surmounted by a cross which marks the centre of the square and in front of the obelisk at the #point# where the three #street# del babuino del corso and di ripetta meet the two uprights of the scaffold between which glittered the curved knife of the mandaïa
the #window# let at an exorbitant price which the #count# had doubtless wished to conceal from his #guest# was on the second #floor# of the great palace situated between the via del babuino and the monte pincio
it consisted as we have said of a small dressing #room# #opening# into a bedroom and when the #door# of communication was shut the inmates were quite alone
at the #corner# of the #street# they met the #count# steward who was awaiting his #master# on #chair# were laid elegant masquerade #costume# of blue and white satin
i have had these brought as they #will# be the most worn this #year# and they are most suitable on #account# of the confetti sweetmeats as they do not show the flour
as you left the choice of your #costume# to me said the #count# to the two #friend#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ heard the #word# of the #count# but imperfectly and he perhaps did not fully appreciate this new #attention# to their #wish# for he was wholly absorbed by the spectacle that the piazza del popolo presented and by the terrible instrument that was in the centre
it was the first #time# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had ever seen a guillotine we say guillotine because the roman mandaïa is formed on almost the same model as the french instrument
the knife which is shaped like a crescent that cuts with the convex #side# falls from a less height and that is all the difference
two #man# seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid were eating their breakfasts while waiting for the criminal
#one# of them lifted the plank took out a flask of wine drank some and then passed it to his #companion#
their repast consisted apparently of bread and sausages these two #man# were the executioner assistants at this #sight# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ felt the perspiration start forth upon his #brow#
the #prisoner# transported the previous #evening# from the carceri nuove to the little church of santa maria del popolo had passed the #night# each accompanied by two #priest# in a chapel closed by a grating before which were two sentinels who were relieved at intervals
a double #line# of carbineers placed on each #side# of the #door# of the church reached to the scaffold and formed a circle around it leaving a path about ten #foot# wide and around the guillotine a space of nearly a hundred #foot#
all the #rest# of the square was paved with #head# many #woman# held their infants on their #shoulder# and thus the #child# had the best view
the monte pincio seemed a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators the balconies of the two churches at the #corner# of the via del babuino and the via di ripetta were crammed the #step# even seemed a parti colored #sea# that was impelled towards the portico every niche in the #wall# held its living statue
what the #count# said was true the most curious spectacle in #life# is that of #death# and yet instead of the #silence# and the solemnity demanded by the occasion laughter and jests arose from the crowd
it was evident that the execution was in the #eye# of the #people# only the commencement of the carnival suddenly the tumult ceased as if by magic and the #door# of the church opened
a brotherhood of penitents clothed from #head# to #foot# in robes of gray sackcloth with holes for the #eye# and holding in their #hand# lighted tapers appeared first the chief marched at the #head#
he was naked with the exception of cloth drawers at the left #side# of which hung a large knife in a sheath and he bore on his #right# #shoulder# a heavy #iron# sledge hammer
behind the penitents came a #man# of vast stature and proportions this #man# was the executioner he had moreover sandals bound on his #foot# by cords
behind the executioner came in the #order# in which they were to die first $peppino$ and then $andrea_rondolo$ each was accompanied by two #priest#
neither had his #eye# bandaged $peppino$ walked with a firm #step# doubtless aware of what awaited him $andrea_rondolo$ was supported by two #priest#
each of them from #time# to #time# kissed the crucifix a confessor held out to them at this #sight# alone $m_franz_de_quesnel$ felt his legs tremble under him
he looked at $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he was as white as his shirt and mechanically cast away his cigar although he had not #half# smoked it
his nostrils dilated like those of a wild beast that scents its prey and his #lip# #half# opened disclosed his white teeth small and sharp like those of a jackal
and yet his #feature# wore an #expression# of smiling tenderness such as $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had never before witnessed in them his black #eye# especially were full of kindness and #pity#
the #count# alone seemed unmoved nay more a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks however the two culprits advanced and as they approached their #face# became visible
$peppino$ was a handsome young #man# of four or five and twenty bronzed by the sun he carried his #head# erect and seemed on the watch to see on which #side# his liberator would appear
in #prison# he had suffered his beard to grow his #head# fell on his #shoulder# his legs bent beneath him and his movements were apparently automatic and unconscious
$andrea_rondolo$ was short and fat his visage marked with brutal cruelty did not indicate #age# he might be thirty i #thought# said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ to the #count# that you told me there would be but #one# execution
i told you true replied he coldly and yet here are two culprits yes but only #one# of these two is about to die the #other# has many #year# to live
if the pardon is to come there is no #time# to lose and see here it is said the #count#
at the #moment# when $peppino$ reached the #foot# of the mandaïa a #priest# arrived in some haste forced his #way# through the #soldier# and advancing to the chief of the brotherhood gave him a folded #paper#
heaven be praised and his holiness also said he in a loud #voice# here is a pardon for #one# of the #prisoner#
the piercing #eye# of $peppino$ had noticed all the chief took the #paper# unfolded it and raising his #hand#
a pardon cried the #people# with #one# #voice# a pardon at this #cry# $andrea_rondolo$ raised his #head#
pardon for whom cried he $peppino$ remained breathless a pardon for $peppino$ called rocca priori said the principal friar and he passed the #paper# to the #officer# commanding the carbineers who read and returned it to him
for $peppino$ cried $andrea_rondolo$ who seemed roused from the torpor in which he had been plunged why for him and not for me
we ought to die together i was promised he should die with me you have no #right# to put me to #death# alone
and he broke from the #priest# struggling and raving like a wild beast and striving desperately to break the cords that bound his #hand#
i #will# not die alone i #will# not the executioner made a #sign# and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold and seized him
what is going on asked $m_franz_de_quesnel$ of the #count# for as all the talk was in the roman dialect he had not perfectly understood it
returned the #count# that this human creature who is about to die is furious that his #fellow# sufferer does not perish with him
he would rather #tear# him to #piece# with his teeth and nails than let him enjoy the #life# he himself is about to be deprived of
do you not see and were he able oh #man# #man# race of crocodiles cried the #count# extending his clenched #hand# towards the crowd
how well do i recognize you there and that at all #time# you are worthy of yourselves meanwhile $andrea_rondolo$ and the two executioners were struggling on the #ground# and he kept exclaiming
he ought to die he shall die i #will# not die alone #look# look cried the #count# seizing the young #man# #hand# #look# for on my soul it is curious
here is a #man# who had resigned himself to his fate who was going to the scaffold to die like a coward it is true but he was about to die without resistance
do you know what gave him #strength# do you know what consoled him it was that another partook of his punishment that another partook of his anguish that another was to die before him
lead two sheep to the butcher two oxen to the slaughterhouse and make #one# of them understand that his #companion# #will# not die the sheep #will# bleat for #pleasure# the ox #will# bellow with #joy#
but #man# #man# whom god created in his own image #man# upon whom god has laid his first his sole commandment to #love# his neighbor #man# to whom god has given a #voice# to express his #thought# what is his first #cry# when he hears
his #fellow# #man# is saved a blasphemy #honor# to #man# this masterpiece of #nature# this #king# of the creation and the #count# burst into a laugh a terrible laugh
that showed he must have suffered horribly to be able thus to laugh however the struggle still continued and it was dreadful to witness
the two assistants carried $andrea_rondolo$ up to the scaffold the #people# all took #part# against $andrea_rondolo$ and twenty thousand #voice# cried
put him to #death# put him to #death# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ sprang back but the #count# seized his #arm# and held him before the #window#
what are you doing said he do you #pity# him if you heard the #cry# of mad dog
you would take your gun you would unhesitatingly shoot the poor beast who after all was only guilty of having been bitten by another dog
and yet you #pity# a #man# who without being bitten by #one# of his race has yet murdered his benefactor and who now unable to kill #anyone# because his #hand# are bound #wish# to see his #companion# in captivity perish
the two assistants had borne $andrea_rondolo$ to the scaffold and there in #spite# of his struggles his bites and his #cry# had forced him to his knees
during this #time# the executioner had raised his mace and signed to them to get out of the #way# the criminal strove to rise but ere he had #time# the mace fell on his left temple
a dull and heavy #sound# was heard and the #man# dropped like an ox on his #face# and then turned over on his back
the executioner let fall his mace drew his knife and with #one# stroke opened his throat and mounting on his stomach stamped violently on it with his #foot#
no no #look# look the recommendation was needless $m_franz_de_quesnel$ was fascinated by the horrible spectacle at every stroke a jet of #blood# sprang from the wound
this #time# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ could contain himself no longer but sank #half# fainting into a #seat# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with his #eye# closed was standing grasping the #window# curtains
when $m_franz_de_quesnel$ recovered his senses he saw $m_albert_de_morcerf$ drinking a #glass# of #water# of which to judge from his pallor he stood in great need and the #count# who was assuming his masquerade #costume#
the #count# was erect and triumphant like the avenging angel #chapter# the carnival at rome he glanced mechanically towards the piazza
the bell of monte citorio which only #sound# on the pope decease and the #opening# of the carnival was ringing a joyous peal
the #scene# was wholly changed scaffold executioners victims all had disappeared only the #people# remained full of #noise# and excitement
well asked he of the #count# what has then happened #nothing# replied the #count# only as you see the carnival has commenced
make haste and dress yourself in #fact# said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ this horrible #scene# has passed away like a #dream#
it is but a #dream# a nightmare that has disturbed you yes that i have suffered but the culprit
that is a #dream# also only he has remained asleep while you have awakened and who knows which of you is the most fortunate
$peppino$ is a lad of sense who unlike most #man# who are happy in proportion as they are noticed was delighted to see that the general #attention# was directed towards his #companion#
but $peppino$ what has become of him he profited by this distraction to slip away among the crowd without even thanking the worthy #priest# who accompanied him
decidedly #man# is an ungrateful and egotistical animal but dress yourself see de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ sets you the example $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was #drawing# on the satin pantaloon over his black trousers and varnished boots
well $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ do you feel much inclined to join the revels come #answer# frankly ma foi no
returned $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but i am really glad to have seen such a #sight# and i understand what the #count# said
that when you have once habituated yourself to a similar spectacle it is the only #one# that causes you any #emotion#
on the #step# of the scaffold #death# #tear# off the mask that has been worn through #life# and the real visage is disclosed
without reflecting that this is the only #moment# in which you can #study# character said the #count# it must be allowed that $andrea_rondolo$ was not very handsome the hideous scoundrel
come dress yourselves #gentleman# dress yourselves $m_franz_de_quesnel$ felt it would be ridiculous not to follow his two #companion# example he assumed his #costume# and fastened on the mask that scarcely equalled the pallor of his own #face#
their toilet finished they descended the #carriage# awaited them at the #door# filled with sweetmeats and bouquets they fell into the #line# of #carriage#
instead of the spectacle of gloomy and silent #death# the piazza del popolo presented a spectacle of gay and noisy mirth and revelry
it is difficult to form an #idea# of the perfect change that had taken #place# a crowd of masks flowed in from all #side# emerging from the #door# descending from the #window#
from every #street# and every #corner# drove #carriage# filled with clowns harlequins dominoes mummers pantomimists transteverins knights and peasants screaming fighting gesticulating throwing eggs filled with flour confetti nosegays attacking with their sarcasms and their missiles #friend# and foes #companion# and #stranger# indiscriminately and no #one# took offence or did #anything# but laugh
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ were like #man# who to drive away a violent sorrow have recourse to wine and who as they drink and become intoxicated feel a thick veil drawn between the past and the present
they saw or rather continued to see the image of what they had witnessed but little by little the general vertigo seized them and they felt themselves obliged to take #part# in the #noise# and confusion
a handful of confetti that came from a neighboring #carriage# and which while it covered $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and his two #companion# with dust pricked his neck and that portion of his #face# uncovered by his mask like a hundred pins incited him to join in the general combat in which all the masks around him were engaged
he rose in his #turn# and seizing handfuls of confetti and sweetmeats with which the #carriage# was filled cast them with all the force and skill he was #master# of
the strife had fairly begun and the recollection of what they had seen #half# an #hour# before was gradually effaced from the young #man# #mind# so much were they occupied by the gay and glittering procession they now beheld
as for the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ he had never for an #instant# shown any #appearance# of having been moved
imagine the large and splendid corso bordered from #one# #end# to the #other# with lofty palaces with their balconies hung with carpets and their #window# with flags
at these balconies are three hundred thousand spectators romans italians #stranger# from all #part# of the #world# the united aristocracy of birth wealth and genius
lovely #woman# yielding to the influence of the #scene# bend over their balconies or lean from their #window# and shower down confetti which are returned by bouquets the #air# seems darkened with the falling confetti and flying flowers
in the #street# the lively crowd is dressed in the most fantastic #costume# gigantic cabbages walk gravely about buffaloes #head# bellow from #man# #shoulder# dogs walk on their hind legs in the midst of all this a mask is lifted and as in callot temptation of st anthony a lovely #face# is exhibited which we would fain follow but from which we are separated by troops of fiends
this #will# give a faint #idea# of the carnival at rome at the second #turn# the #count# stopped the #carriage# and requested permission to withdraw leaving the vehicle at their disposal
at the centre #window# the #one# hung with white damask with a red cross was a blue domino beneath which $m_franz_de_quesnel$ imagination easily pictured the beautiful greek of the argentina
#gentleman# said the #count# springing out when you are tired of being actors and #wish# to become spectators of this #scene# you know you have #place# at my #window#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ looked up they were opposite the rospoli palace in the meantime dispose of my coachman my #carriage# and my #servant#
we have forgotten to mention that the #count# coachman was attired in a bear skin exactly resembling odry in the bear and the pasha and the two footmen behind were dressed up as green monkeys with spring masks with which they made grimaces at #everyone# who passed
as for $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he was busily occupied throwing bouquets at a #carriage# full of roman peasants that was passing near him
unfortunately for him the #line# of #carriage# moved on again and while he descended the piazza del popolo the #other# ascended towards the palazzo di venezia
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ thanked the #count# for his #attention# ah my dear #fellow# said he to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ you did not see
what there that calash filled with roman peasants no well i am convinced they are all charming #woman#
how unfortunate that you were masked $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ here was an opportunity of making up for past disappointments
oh replied he #half# laughing #half# serious i #hope# the carnival #will# not pass without some amends in #one# shape or the #other#
but in #spite# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #hope# the #day# passed unmarked by any incident excepting two or three encounters with the #carriage# full of roman peasants
at #one# of these encounters accidentally or purposely $m_albert_de_morcerf$ mask fell off he instantly rose and cast the remainder of the bouquets into the #carriage#
their coquettish disguise was touched by his gallantry for as the #carriage# of the two #friend# passed her she threw a bunch of violets
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ seized it and as $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had no #reason# to suppose it was meant for him he suffered $m_albert_de_morcerf$ to retain it
doubtless #one# of the charming females $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had detected beneath $m_albert_de_morcerf$ placed it in his button hole and the #carriage# went triumphantly on
well said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ to him there is the beginning of an adventure laugh if you please i really think so
the jest however soon appeared to become earnest for when $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and $m_franz_de_quesnel$ again encountered the #carriage# with the contadini the #one# who had thrown the violets to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ clapped her #hand# when she beheld them in his button hole
so i #will# not abandon this bouquet $pardieu$ returned $m_franz_de_quesnel$ laughing in token of your ingratitude
bravo bravo said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #thing# go wonderfully shall i leave you perhaps you would prefer being alone no replied he
i #will# not be caught like a fool at a first disclosure by a rendezvous under the clock as they say at the opera balls
if the fair peasant #wish# to carry #matter# any further we shall find her or rather she #will# find us #tomorrow# then she #will# give me some #sign# or #other# and i shall know what i have to do
on my #word# said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ you are as wise as nestor and prudent as ulysses and your fair circe must be very skilful or very powerful if she succeed in changing you into a beast of any kind
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ was #right# the fair unknown had resolved doubtless to carry the intrigue no farther for although the young #man# made several more #turn# they did not again see the calash which had turned up #one# of the neighboring #street#
then they returned to the rospoli palace but the #count# and the blue domino had also disappeared the two #window# hung with yellow damask were still occupied by the #person# whom the #count# had invited
at this #moment# the same bell that had proclaimed the beginning of the mascherata sounded the retreat
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ were opposite the via delle muratte the coachman without saying a #word# drove up it passed along the piazza di spagna and the rospoli palace and stopped at the #door# of the hotel
the file on the corso broke the #line# and in a second all the #carriage# had disappeared $signor_pastrini$ came to the #door# to receive his #guest#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ hastened to inquire after the #count# and to express regret that he had not returned in sufficient #time# but $signor_pastrini$ reassured him by saying that the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ had ordered a second #carriage# for himself and that it had gone at four clock to fetch him from the rospoli palace
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ questioned $m_albert_de_morcerf$ as to his intentions but $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had great projects to put into execution before going to the theatre and instead of making any #answer# he inquired if $signor_pastrini$ could procure him a tailor
the #count# had moreover charged him to offer the two #friend# the key of his #box# at the argentina a tailor said the host
and for what to make us between now and #tomorrow# two roman peasant #costume# returned $m_albert_de_morcerf$ the host shook his #head#
i ask your #excellency# pardon but this is quite a french demand for the next week you #will# not find a single tailor who would consent to sew six buttons on a waistcoat if you paid him a crown a #piece# for each button
to make you two #costume# between now and #tomorrow# then i must give up the #idea#
leave all to me and #tomorrow# when you awake you shall find a collection of #costume# with which you #will# be satisfied
my dear $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ leave all to our host he has already proved himself full of resources let us dine quietly and afterwards go and see italienne
but remember $signor_pastrini$ that both my #friend# and myself attach the greatest importance to having #tomorrow# the #costume# we have asked for
the host again assured them they might rely on him and that their #wish# should be attended to upon which $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ mounted to their #apartment# and proceeded to disencumber themselves of their #costume#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ as he took off his dress carefully preserved the bunch of violets it was his token reserved for the morrow
the two #friend# sat down to #table# but they could not refrain from remarking the difference between the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ #table# and that of $signor_pastrini$
#truth# compelled $m_franz_de_quesnel$ in #spite# of the dislike he seemed to have taken to the #count# to confess that the advantage was not on $signor_pastrini$ #side#
no we have them ready made alger agreed returned $m_albert_de_morcerf$ during dessert the #servant# inquired at what #time# they wished for the #carriage#
his #excellency# the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ had he said given positive #order# that the #carriage# was to remain at their lordships #order# all #day# and they could therefore dispose of it without #fear# of indiscretion
they resolved to profit by the #count# courtesy and ordered the #horse# to be harnessed while they substituted #evening# dress for that which they had on and which was somewhat the worse for the numerous combats they had sustained
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ and $m_franz_de_quesnel$ looked at each #other# fearing really to abuse the #count# kindness the #servant# understood them m
this precaution taken they went to the theatre and installed themselves in the #count# #box# during the first act the #countess# entered
her first #look# was at the #box# where she had seen the #count# the previous #evening# so that she perceived $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in the #place# of the very #person# concerning whom she had expressed so strange an #opinion# to $m_franz_de_quesnel$
her opera #glass# was so fixedly directed towards them that $m_franz_de_quesnel$ saw it would be cruel not to satisfy her curiosity and availing himself of #one# of the privileges of the spectators of the italian theatres who #use# their #box# to hold receptions the two #friend# went to pay their respects to the #countess#
scarcely had they entered when she motioned to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ to assume the #seat# of #honor# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in his #turn# sat behind
it seems you have #nothing# better to do than to make the acquaintance of this new $lord_ruthven$ and you are already the best #friend# in the #world#
well said she hardly giving $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #time# to sit down without being so far advanced as that my dear #countess# returned $m_franz_de_quesnel$
yes this #morning# we breakfasted with him we rode in his #carriage# all #day# and now we have taken #possession# of his #box#
i cannot deny that we have abused his good #nature# all #day# all #day#
you know him then yes and no how so it is a long #story# tell it to me
it would frighten you too much so much the more #reason# at least wait until the #story# has a conclusion
very well i prefer complete histories but tell me how you made his acquaintance did #anyone# introduce you to him
no it was he who introduced himself to us when last #night# after we left you
through what medium the very prosaic #one# of our landlord he is staying then at the hôtel de londres with you
not only in the same hotel but on the same #floor# what is his #name# for of #course# you know
the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ that is not a #family# #name# no it is the #name# of the #island# he has purchased
and he is a #count# a tuscan #count# well we must put up with that said the #countess# who was herself from #one# of the oldest venetian #family#
what #sort# of a #man# is he ask the vicomte de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ you hear de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i am referred to you said the #countess#
we should be very hard to please madam returned $m_albert_de_morcerf$ did we not think him delightful a #friend# of ten #year# standing could not have done more for us or with a more perfect courtesy
i see my vampire is only some millionaire who has taken the #appearance# of lara in #order# to avoid being confounded with de rothschild and you have seen her
come observed the #countess# smiling her the beautiful greek of #yesterday# no we heard i think the #sound# of her guzla but she remained perfectly invisible
it is only to keep up the mystery for whom do you take the blue domino at the #window# with the white curtains
when you say invisible interrupted $m_albert_de_morcerf$ where was this #window# with white hangings asked the #countess#
at the rospoli palace the #count# had three #window# at the rospoli palace yes did you pass through the corso
yes well did you notice two #window# hung with yellow damask and #one# with white damask with a red cross
those were the #count# #window# why he must be a nabob do you know what those three #window# were worth
two or three hundred roman crowns two or three thousand the deuce does his #island# produce him such a revenue
it does not bring him a bajocco then why did he purchase it for a whim
he is an original then in reality observed $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he seemed to me somewhat eccentric were he at paris and a frequenter of the theatres
i should say he was a poor devil literally mad this #morning# he made two or three exits worthy of didier or anthony
at this #moment# a fresh visitor entered and according to custom $m_franz_de_quesnel$ gave up his #seat# to him this #circumstance# had moreover the #effect# of changing the #conversation# an #hour# afterwards the two #friend# returned to their hotel
$signor_pastrini$ had already set about procuring their disguises for the morrow and he assured them that they would be perfectly satisfied
the next #morning# at nine clock he entered $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #room# followed by a tailor who had eight or ten roman peasant #costume# on his #arm# they selected two exactly alike and charged the tailor to sew on each of their hats about twenty yards of ribbon and to procure them two of the long silk sashes of different colors with which the lower #order# decorate themselves on fête #day#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ was impatient to see how he looked in his new dress a jacket and breeches of blue velvet silk stockings with clocks shoes with buckles and a silk waistcoat
this picturesque attire set him off to great advantage and when he had bound the scarf around his waist and when his hat placed coquettishly on #one# #side# let fall on his #shoulder# a stream of ribbons $m_franz_de_quesnel$ was forced to confess that #costume# has much to do with the physical superiority we accord to certain nations
the turks used to be so picturesque with their long and flowing robes but are they not now hideous with their blue frocks buttoned up to the chin and their red caps which make them #look# like a bottle of wine with a red seal
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ complimented $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who looked at himself in the #glass# with an unequivocal #smile# of satisfaction they were thus engaged when the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ entered
i come to say that #today# and for the remainder of the carnival i leave the #carriage# entirely at your disposal
the host #will# tell you i have three or four more so that you #will# not inconvenience me in any #way#
#gentleman# said he although a #companion# is agreeable perfect freedom is sometimes still more agreeable make #use# of it i pray you for your #pleasure# or your #business#
the young #man# wished to decline but they could find no good #reason# for refusing an offer which was so agreeable to them
the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ remained a #quarter# of an #hour# with them conversing on all #subject# with the greatest ease
he was as we have already said perfectly well acquainted with the literature of all #country# a #glance# at the #wall# of his salon proved to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ that he was a connoisseur of pictures
a few #word# he let fall showed them that he was no #stranger# to the sciences and he seemed much occupied with chemistry
the two #friend# did not venture to #return# the #count# the breakfast he had given them it would have been too absurd to offer him in exchange for his excellent #table# the very inferior #one# of $signor_pastrini$
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ was charmed with the #count# #manner# and he was only prevented from recognizing him for a perfect #gentleman# by #reason# of his varied knowledge
the permission to do what he liked with the #carriage# pleased him above all for the fair peasants had appeared in a most elegant #carriage# the preceding #evening# and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was not sorry to be upon an equal footing with them
at #half# past #one# they descended the coachman and footman had put on their livery over their disguises which gave them a more ridiculous #appearance# than ever and which gained them the applause of $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$
they told him so frankly and he received their excuses with the #air# of a #man# who appreciated their delicacy $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had fastened the faded bunch of violets to his button hole
at the second #turn# a bunch of fresh violets thrown from a #carriage# filled with harlequins indicated to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ that like himself and his #friend# the peasants had changed their #costume# also and whether it was the result of #chance# or whether a similar #feeling# had possessed them both while he had donned their #costume# they had assumed his
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ placed the fresh bouquet in his button hole but he kept the faded #one# in his #hand# and when he again met the calash he raised it to his #lip# an action which seemed greatly to amuse not only the fair #lady# who had thrown it but her joyous #companion# also
the #day# was as gay as the preceding #one# perhaps even more animated and noisy the #count# appeared for an #instant# at his #window# but when they again passed he had disappeared
at the first #sound# of the bell they hastened into the corso by the via vittoria it is almost needless to say that the flirtation between $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and the fair peasant continued all #day#
in the #evening# on his #return# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ found a #letter# from the embassy informing him that he would have the #honor# of being received by his holiness the next #day#
at each previous #visit# he had made to rome he had solicited and obtained the same favor and incited as much by a religious #feeling# as by gratitude he was unwilling to quit the capital of the christian #world# without laying his respectful homage at the #foot# of #one# of st peter successors who has set the rare example of all the virtues
he did not then think of the carnival for in #spite# of his condescension and touching kindness #one# cannot incline #one# self without awe before the venerable and noble old #man# called gregory xvi
on his #return# from the vatican $m_franz_de_quesnel$ carefully avoided the corso he brought away with him a #treasure# of pious #thought# to which the mad gayety of the maskers would have been profanation
at ten #minute# past five $m_albert_de_morcerf$ entered overjoyed the harlequin had reassumed her peasant #costume# and as she passed she raised her mask
she was charming $m_franz_de_quesnel$ congratulated $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who received his congratulations with the #air# of a #man# conscious that they are merited
he had recognized by certain unmistakable #sign# that his fair incognita belonged to the aristocracy he had made up his #mind# to write to her the next #day#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ remarked while he gave these details that $m_albert_de_morcerf$ seemed to have #something# to ask of him but that he was unwilling to ask it
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ let himself be pressed just as long as friendship required and then avowed to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ that he would do him a great favor by allowing him to occupy the #carriage# alone the next #day#
he insisted upon it declaring beforehand that he was willing to make any sacrifice the #other# wished $m_albert_de_morcerf$ attributed to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ absence the extreme kindness of the fair peasant in raising her mask
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ was not sufficiently egotistical to stop $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in the middle of an adventure that promised to prove so agreeable to his curiosity and so flattering to his vanity
he felt assured that the perfect indiscretion of his #friend# would duly inform him of all that happened and as during three #year# that he had travelled all over italy a similar #piece# of good #fortune# had never fallen to his share $m_franz_de_quesnel$ was by no #mean# sorry to learn how to act on such an occasion
he therefore promised $m_albert_de_morcerf$ that he would content himself the morrow with witnessing the carnival from the #window# of the rospoli palace
the next #morning# he saw $m_albert_de_morcerf$ pass and repass holding an enormous bouquet which he doubtless meant to make the bearer of his amorous epistle
this belief was changed into certainty when $m_franz_de_quesnel$ saw the bouquet conspicuous by a circle of white camellias in the #hand# of a charming harlequin dressed in rose colored satin
the #evening# was no longer #joy# but delirium $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #nothing# doubted but that the fair unknown would reply in the same #manner#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ anticipated his #wish# by saying that the #noise# fatigued him and that he should pass the next #day# in writing and looking over his journal
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ was not deceived for the next #evening# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ saw him enter triumphantly shaking a folded #paper# which he held by #one# #corner#
well said he was i mistaken she has answered you cried $m_franz_de_quesnel$ read this #word# was pronounced in a #manner# impossible to describe
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ took the #letter# and read tuesday #evening# at seven clock descend from your #carriage# opposite the via dei pontefici and follow the roman peasant who snatches your torch from you
when you arrive at the first #step# of the church of san giacomo be sure to fasten a knot of rose colored ribbons to the #shoulder# of your harlequin #costume# in #order# that you may be recognized
until then you #will# not see me constancy and discretion well asked he when $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had finished what do you think of that
i think that the adventure is assuming a very agreeable #appearance# i think so also replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$
and i very much #fear# you #will# go alone to the duke of bracciano ball $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had received that #morning# an invitation from the celebrated roman #banker#
all the nobility of rome #will# be present and if your fair incognita belong to the higher class of society she must go there
take #care# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ whether she goes there or not my #opinion# is still the same returned $m_albert_de_morcerf$
you have read the #letter# yes you know how imperfectly the #woman# of the mezzo cito are educated in italy
this is the #name# of the lower class yes well read the #letter# again #look# at the writing and find if you can any blemish in the language or orthography
the writing was in reality charming and the orthography irreproachable you are born to good #fortune# said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ as he returned the #letter#
laugh as much as you #will# replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i am in #love# you alarm me cried $m_franz_de_quesnel$
i see that i shall not only go alone to the duke of bracciano but also #return# to florence alone
if my unknown be as amiable as she is beautiful said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i shall fix myself at rome for six weeks at least
i adore rome and i have always had a great taste for archæology come two or three more such adventures and i do not #despair# of seeing you a member of the academy
doubtless $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was about to discuss seriously his #right# to the academic #chair# when they were informed that #dinner# was ready
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ #love# had not taken away his appetite he hastened with $m_franz_de_quesnel$ to #seat# himself free to recommence the discussion after #dinner#
after #dinner# the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ was announced they had not seen him for two #day# $signor_pastrini$ informed them that #business# had called him to civita vecchia
whether he kept a watch over himself or whether by accident he did not #sound# the acrimonious chords that in #other# #circumstance# had been touched he was tonight like everybody else
he had started the previous #evening# and had only returned an #hour# since he was charming the #man# was an enigma to $m_franz_de_quesnel$
the #count# must feel sure that $m_franz_de_quesnel$ recognized him and yet he had not let fall a single #word# indicating any previous acquaintance between them
on his #side# however great $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #desire# was to allude to their former interview the #fear# of being disagreeable to the #man# who had loaded him and his #friend# with kindness prevented him from mentioning it
the #count# had learned that the two #friend# had sent to secure a #box# at the argentina theatre and were told they were all let
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ made some difficulty alleging their #fear# of depriving him of it but the #count# replied that as he was going to the palli theatre the #box# at the argentina theatre would be lost if they did not profit by it
in consequence he brought them the key of his own at least such was the apparent motive of his #visit# this assurance determined the two #friend# to accept it
he could not refrain from admiring the severe beauty of his #feature# the only defect or rather the principal quality of which was the pallor
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ had by degrees become accustomed to the #count# pallor which had so forcibly struck him at their first meeting truly a byronic hero
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ could not we #will# not say see him but even think of him without imagining his stern #head# upon manfred #shoulder# or beneath lara helmet
his #forehead# was marked with the #line# that indicates the constant #presence# of bitter #thought# he had the fiery #eye# that seem to penetrate to the very soul and the haughty and disdainful upper #lip# that gives to the #word# it utters a peculiar character that impresses them on the #mind# of those to whom they are addressed
he was at least forty and yet it was easy to understand that he was formed to rule the young #man# with whom he associated at present
and to complete his resemblance with the fantastic heroes of the english poet the #count# seemed to have the #power# of fascination
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ was less enthusiastic but the #count# exercised over him also the ascendency a strong #mind# always acquires over a #mind# less domineering
he #thought# several #time# of the project the #count# had of visiting paris and he had no #doubt# but that with his eccentric character his characteristic #face# and his colossal #fortune# he would produce a great #effect# there
the #count# was no longer young $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was constantly expatiating on their good #fortune# in meeting such a #man# and yet he did not #wish# to be at paris when the #count# was there
the #evening# passed as #evening# mostly pass at italian theatres that is not in listening to the music but in paying #visit# and conversing
the #countess# wished to revive the #subject# of the #count# but $m_franz_de_quesnel$ announced he had #something# far newer to tell her and in #spite# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ demonstrations of false modesty he informed the #countess# of the great #event# which had preoccupied them for the last three #day#
as similar intrigues are not uncommon in italy if we may credit #traveller# the comtess did not manifest the least incredulity but congratulated $m_albert_de_morcerf$ on his success
the heroine of the bouquet kept her #word# she gave $m_albert_de_morcerf$ no #sign# of her existence the morrow or the #day# after
they promised upon separating to meet at the duke of bracciano ball to which all rome was invited at #length# tuesday came the last and most tumultuous #day# of the carnival
on tuesday all those who through want of #money# #time# or enthusiasm have not been to see the carnival before mingle in the gayety and contribute to the #noise# and excitement
from two clock till five $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ followed in the fête exchanging handfuls of confetti with the #other# #carriage# and the pedestrians who crowded amongst the #horse# #foot# and the #carriage# wheels without a single accident a single dispute or a single fight
on tuesday the theatres open at ten clock in the #morning# as lent begins after eight at #night# the fêtes are veritable #pleasure# #day# to the italians
the author of this history who has resided five or six #year# in italy does not recollect to have ever seen a ceremony interrupted by #one# of those #event# so common in #other# #country#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ was triumphant in his harlequin #costume# a knot of rose colored ribbons fell from his #shoulder# almost to the #ground# in #order# that there might be no confusion $m_franz_de_quesnel$ wore his peasant #costume#
there was not on the pavement in the #carriage# at the #window# a single tongue that was silent a single #arm# that did not move
it was a human storm made up of a thunder of #cry# and a hail of sweetmeats flowers eggs oranges and nosegays
at three clock the #sound# of fireworks let off on the piazza del popolo and the piazza di venezia heard with difficulty amid the din and confusion announced that the races were about to begin
as the #day# advanced the tumult became greater the races like the moccoli are #one# of the episodes peculiar to the last #day# of the carnival
at the #sound# of the fireworks the #carriage# instantly broke ranks and retired by the adjacent #street# all these evolutions are executed with an inconceivable address and marvellous rapidity without the #police# interfering in the #matter#
the pedestrians ranged themselves against the #wall# then the trampling of #horse# and the clashing of steel were heard a detachment of carbineers fifteen abreast galloped up the corso in #order# to clear it for the barberi
when the detachment arrived at the piazza di venezia a second volley of fireworks was discharged to announce that the #street# was clear
almost instantly in the midst of a tremendous and general outcry seven or eight #horse# excited by the shouts of three hundred thousand spectators passed by like lightning
immediately without any #other# signal the #carriage# moved on flowing on towards the corso down all the #street# like torrents pent up for a while which again flow into the parent river and the immense stream again continued its #course# between its two granite banks
then the castle of saint angelo fired three cannon to indicate that number three had won a new source of #noise# and movement was added to the crowd
the moccoli or moccoletti are candles which vary in size from the pascal taper to the rushlight and which give to each actor in the great final #scene# of the carnival two very serious problems to grapple with first how to keep his own moccoletto alight and secondly how to extinguish the moccoletti of #other#
the sellers of moccoletti entered on the #scene# the moccoletto is like #life# #man# has found but #one# #mean# of transmitting it and that #one# comes from god
but he has discovered a thousand #mean# of taking it away and the devil has somewhat aided him the moccoletto is kindled by approaching it to a #light#
but who can describe the thousand #mean# of extinguishing the moccoletto the gigantic bellows the monstrous extinguishers the superhuman fans
#everyone# hastened to purchase moccoletti $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ among the #rest# the #night# was rapidly approaching and already at the #cry# of moccoletti
repeated by the shrill #voice# of a thousand vendors two or three stars began to burn among the crowd it was a signal
at the #end# of ten #minute# fifty thousand #light# glittered descending from the palazzo di venezia to the piazza del popolo and mounting from the piazza del popolo to the palazzo di venezia
suppose that all the stars had descended from the sky and mingled in a wild dance on the #face# of the #earth# the whole accompanied by #cry# that were never heard in any #other# #part# of the #world#
it seemed like the fête of jack lanterns it is impossible to form any #idea# of it without having seen it the facchino follows the prince the transteverin the citizen #everyone# blowing extinguishing relighting
had old æolus appeared at this #moment# he would have been proclaimed #king# of the moccoli and aquilo the heir presumptive to the throne
this battle of folly and flame continued for two #hour# the corso was #light# as #day# the #feature# of the spectators on the third and fourth #story# were visible
every five #minute# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ took out his watch at #length# it pointed to seven the two #friend# were in the via dei pontefici
two or three masks strove to knock his moccoletto out of his #hand# but $m_albert_de_morcerf$ a first rate pugilist sent them rolling in the #street# #one# after the #other# and continued his #course# towards the church of san giacomo
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ sprang out bearing his moccoletto in his #hand# the #step# were crowded with masks who strove to snatch each #other# torches
instantly a mask wearing the well known #costume# of a peasant #woman# snatched his moccoletto from him without his offering any resistance
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ was too far off to hear what they said but without #doubt# #nothing# hostile passed for he saw $m_albert_de_morcerf$ disappear #arm# in #arm# with the peasant #girl#
he watched them pass through the crowd for some #time# but at #length# he lost #sight# of them in the via macello
suddenly the bell that gives the signal for the #end# of the carnival sounded and at the same #instant# all the moccoletti were extinguished as if by enchantment
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ followed $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with his #eye# and saw him mount the first #step# it seemed as though #one# immense blast of the wind had extinguished #everyone#
no #sound# was audible save that of the #carriage# that were carrying the maskers home #nothing# was visible save a few #light# that burnt behind the #window#
in his whole #life# perhaps $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had never before experienced so sudden an impression so rapid a transition from gayety to sadness as in this #moment#
it seemed as though rome under the magic breath of some demon of the #night# had suddenly changed into a vast tomb
by a #chance# which added yet more to the intensity of the #darkness# the moon which was on the wane did not rise until eleven clock and the #street# which the young #man# traversed were plunged in the deepest obscurity
the #distance# was short and at the #end# of ten #minute# his #carriage# or rather the #count# stopped before the hôtel de londres
#dinner# was waiting but as $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had told him that he should not #return# so soon $m_franz_de_quesnel$ sat down without him
$signor_pastrini$ who had been accustomed to see them dine together inquired into the cause of his absence but $m_franz_de_quesnel$ merely replied that $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had received on the previous #evening# an invitation which he had accepted
the sudden extinction of the moccoletti the #darkness# which had replaced the #light# and the #silence# which had succeeded the turmoil had left in $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #mind# a certain depression which was not free from uneasiness
he therefore dined very silently in #spite# of the officious #attention# of his host who presented himself two or three #time# to inquire if he wanted #anything#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ found himself in utter #darkness# the carnival was over #chapter# the catacombs of saint sebastian $m_franz_de_quesnel$ resolved to wait for $m_albert_de_morcerf$ as late as possible
he ordered the #carriage# therefore for eleven clock desiring $signor_pastrini$ to inform him the #moment# that $m_albert_de_morcerf$ returned to the hotel
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ dressed himself and went out telling his host that he was going to pass the #night# at the duke of bracciano
the $house_of_peers$ of the duke of bracciano is #one# of the most delightful in rome the duchess #one# of the last heiresses of the colonnas does its #honor# with the most consummate grace and thus their fêtes have a european celebrity
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had brought to rome #letter# of introduction to them and their first #question# on his arrival was to inquire the whereabouts of his travelling #companion#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ replied that he had left him at the #moment# they were about to extinguish the moccoli and that he had lost #sight# of him in the via macello
at eleven clock $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had not come back then he has not returned said the duke i waited for him until this #hour# replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$
and do you know whither he went no not precisely however i think it was #something# very like a rendezvous
said the duke this is a bad #day# or rather a bad #night# to be out late is it not #countess#
these #word# were addressed to the #countess# who had just arrived and was leaning on the #arm# of signor torlonia the duke #brother#
i think on the #contrary# that it is a charming #night# replied the #countess# and those who are here #will# complain of but #one# #thing# that of its too rapid flight
i am not speaking said the duke with a #smile# of the #person# who are here the #man# run no #other# danger than that of falling in #love# with you and the #woman# of falling ill of jealousy at seeing you so lovely i meant #person# who were out in the #street# of rome
ah asked the #countess# who is out in the #street# of rome at this #hour# unless it be to go to a ball
our #friend# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #countess# whom i left in pursuit of his unknown about seven clock this #evening# said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and whom i have not seen since
diavolo and dont you know where he is not at all
is he armed he is in masquerade you should not have allowed him to go said the duke to $m_franz_de_quesnel$
you might as well have tried to stop number three of the barberi who gained the prize in the race #today# replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$
you who know rome better than he does and then moreover what could happen to him who can tell
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ felt a shudder run through his veins at observing that the #feeling# of the duke and the #countess# was so much in unison with his own personal disquietude
i informed them at the hotel that i had the #honor# of passing the #night# here duke said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and desired them to come and inform me of his #return#
the #night# is gloomy and the tiber is very near the via macello ah replied the duke here i think is #one# of my #servant# who is seeking you
your #excellency# he said the #master# of the hôtel de londres has sent to let you know that a #man# is waiting for you with a #letter# from the viscount of $m_albert_de_morcerf$
the duke was not mistaken when he saw $m_franz_de_quesnel$ the #servant# came up to him a #letter# from the viscount
exclaimed $m_franz_de_quesnel$ yes and who is the #man# i do not know why did he not bring it to me here
the messenger did not say and where is the messenger he went away directly he saw me enter the ball #room# to find you
oh said the #countess# to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ go with all speed poor young #man# perhaps some accident has happened to him
i #will# hasten replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ shall we see you again to give us any information inquired the #countess#
yes if it is not any serious #affair# otherwise i cannot #answer# as to what i may do myself
be prudent in any #event# said the #countess# oh pray be assured of that $m_franz_de_quesnel$ took his hat and went away in haste
he had sent away his #carriage# with #order# for it to fetch him at two clock fortunately the palazzo bracciano which is on #one# #side# in the corso and on the #other# in the square of the holy apostles is hardly ten #minute# walk from the hôtel de londres
as he came near the hotel $m_franz_de_quesnel$ saw a #man# in the middle of the #street# he had no #doubt# that it was the messenger from $m_albert_de_morcerf$
the #man# was wrapped up in a large cloak he went up to him but to his extreme #astonishment# the #stranger# first addressed him
what wants your #excellency# of me inquired the #man# retreating a #step# or two as if to keep on his guard
are not you the #person# who brought me a #letter# inquired $m_franz_de_quesnel$ from the viscount of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ your #excellency# lodges at $signor_pastrini$ hotel
i do your #excellency# is the travelling #companion# of the viscount i am your #excellency# #name#
is the #baron# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay then it is to your #excellency# that this #letter# is addressed
is there any #answer# inquired $m_franz_de_quesnel$ taking the #letter# from him yes your #friend# at least #hope# so
come upstairs with me and i #will# give it to you i prefer waiting here said the messenger with a #smile#
and why your #excellency# #will# know when you have read the #letter# shall i find you here then
certainly $m_franz_de_quesnel$ entered the hotel on the #staircase# he met $signor_pastrini$ well said the landlord well what
responded $m_franz_de_quesnel$ you have seen the #man# who desired to speak with you from your #friend# he asked of $m_franz_de_quesnel$
yes i have seen him he replied and he has handed this #letter# to me #light# the candles in my #apartment# if you please
the young #man# had found $signor_pastrini$ looking very much alarmed and this had only made him the more anxious to read $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #letter# and so he went instantly towards the waxlight and unfolded it
the innkeeper gave #order# to a #servant# to go before $m_franz_de_quesnel$ with a #light# it was written and signed by $m_albert_de_morcerf$
the #moment# you have received this have the kindness to take the #letter# of credit from my #pocket# book which you #will# find in the square drawer of the secrétaire add your own to it if it be not sufficient
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ read it twice before he could comprehend what it contained it was thus worded my dear #fellow# run to torlonia draw from him instantly four thousand piastres and give them to the bearer
it is urgent that i should have this #money# without delay i do not say more relying on you as you may rely on me
your #friend# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ s i now believe in italian banditti below these #line# were written in a strange #hand# the following in italian
se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte alberto avrà cessato di vivere
if by six in the #morning# the four thousand piastres are not in my #hand# by seven clock the #count# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #will# have ceased to live
this second signature explained #everything# to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ who now understood the objection of the messenger to coming up into the #apartment# the #street# was safer for him
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ then had fallen into the #hand# of the famous #bandit# chief in whose existence he had for so long a #time# refused to believe
he hastened to open the secrétaire and found the #pocket# book in the drawer and in it the #letter# of credit
$luigi_vampa$ there was no #time# to lose there were in all six thousand piastres but of these six thousand $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had already expended three thousand
as to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ he had no #letter# of credit as he lived at florence and had only come to rome to pass seven or eight #day# he had brought but a hundred $louis_xviii$ and of these he had not more than fifty left
thus seven or eight hundred piastres were wanting to them both to make up the #sum# that $m_albert_de_morcerf$ required true he might in such a #case# rely on the kindness of signor torlonia
he was therefore about to #return# to the palazzo bracciano without loss of #time# when suddenly a luminous #idea# crossed his #mind#
he remembered the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ $m_franz_de_quesnel$ was about to ring for $signor_pastrini$ when that worthy presented himself
my dear #sir# he said hastily do you know if the #count# is within yes your #excellency# he has this #moment# returned
then ring at his #door# if you please and request him to be so kind as to give me an audience
is he in #bed# i should say no $signor_pastrini$ did as he was desired and returning five #minute# after he said
the #count# awaits your #excellency# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ went along the corridor and a #servant# introduced him to the #count# he was in a small #room# which $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had not yet seen and which was surrounded with divans
the #count# came towards him well what good wind blows you hither at this #hour# said he have you come to sup with me
it would be very kind of you no i have come to speak to you of a very serious #matter#
a serious #matter# said the #count# looking at $m_franz_de_quesnel$ with the earnestness usual to him and what may it be
are we alone yes replied the #count# going to the #door# and returning $m_franz_de_quesnel$ gave him $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #letter#
read that he said the #count# read it well well said he did you see the postscript
i did indeed se alle sei della mattina le quattro mille piastre non sono nelle mie mani alla sette il conte
alberto avrà cessato di vivere $luigi_vampa$ what think you of that inquired $m_franz_de_quesnel$ have you the #money# he demands
the #count# went to his secrétaire opened it and pulling out a drawer filled with #gold# said to $m_franz_de_quesnel$
yes all but eight hundred piastres i #hope# you #will# not offend me by applying to #anyone# but myself
you see on the #contrary# i come to you first and instantly replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and i #thank# you have what you #will# and he made a #sign# to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ to take what he pleased
is it absolutely necessary then to send the #money# to $luigi_vampa$ asked the young #man# looking fixedly in his #turn# at the #count#
i think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting you could find a #way# of simplifying the negotiation said $m_franz_de_quesnel$
judge for yourself replied he the postscript is explicit how so returned the #count# with surprise
if we were to go together to $luigi_vampa$ i am sure he would not refuse you $m_albert_de_morcerf$ freedom
what influence can i possibly have over a #bandit# have you not just rendered him a #service# that can never be forgotten
what is that have you not saved $peppino$ #life# well well said the #count# who told you that
no #matter# i know it the #count# knit his #brow# and remained silent an #instant# and if i went to seek $luigi_vampa$ would you accompany me
if my society would not be disagreeable be it so it is a lovely #night# and a walk without rome #will# do us both good
shall i take any #arm# for what #purpose# any #money# it is useless where is the #man# who brought the #letter#
in the #street# he awaits the #answer# yes i must learn where we are going
i #will# summon him hither it is useless he would not come up to your #apartment# perhaps but he #will# not make any difficulty at entering mine
the #count# went to the #window# of the #apartment# that looked on to the #street# and whistled in a peculiar #manner#
the #man# in the mantle quitted the #wall# and advanced into the middle of the #street# salite said the #count# in the same #tone# in which he would have given an #order# to his #servant#
the messenger obeyed without the least hesitation but rather with alacrity and mounting the #step# at a bound entered the hotel five seconds afterwards he was at the #door# of the #room#
ah it is you $peppino$ said the #count# but $peppino$ instead of answering threw himself on his knees seized the #count# #hand# and covered it with kisses
ah said the #count# you have then not forgotten that i saved your #life# that is strange for it is a week ago
no #excellency# and never shall i forget it returned $peppino$ with an accent of profound gratitude
never that is a long #time# but it is #something# that you believe so rise and #answer# $peppino$ glanced anxiously at $m_franz_de_quesnel$
oh you may speak before his #excellency# said he he is #one# of my #friend# you allow me to give you this title continued the #count# in french
it is necessary to excite this #man# confidence you can speak before me said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ i am a #friend# of the #count#
good returned $peppino$ i am ready to #answer# any #question# your #excellency# may address to me
how did the viscount $m_albert_de_morcerf$ fall into $luigi_vampa$ #hand# #excellency# the frenchman #carriage# passed several #time# the #one# in which was $teresa$
the frenchman threw her a bouquet $teresa$ returned it all this with the consent of the chief who was in the #carriage#
the chief mistress yes what cried $m_franz_de_quesnel$ was $luigi_vampa$ in the #carriage# with the roman peasants
it was he who drove disguised as the coachman replied $peppino$ well said the #count# well then the frenchman took off his mask $teresa$ with the chief consent did the same
the frenchman asked for a rendezvous $teresa$ gave him #one# only instead of $teresa$ it was $beppo$ who was on the #step# of the church of san giacomo
what exclaimed $m_franz_de_quesnel$ the peasant #girl# who snatched his mocoletto from him was a lad of fifteen replied $peppino$
but it was no disgrace to your #friend# to have been deceived $beppo$ has taken in plenty of #other#
and $beppo$ led him outside the #wall# said the #count# exactly so a #carriage# was waiting at the #end# of the via macello
$beppo$ got in inviting the frenchman to follow him and he did not wait to be asked twice he gallantly offered the #right# #hand# #seat# to $beppo$ and sat by him
$beppo$ told him he was going to take him to a villa a league from rome the frenchman assured him he would follow him to the #end# of the #world#
the coachman went up the via di ripetta and the porta san paolo and when they were two hundred yards outside as the frenchman became somewhat too forward $beppo$ put a brace of #pistol# to his #head# the coachman pulled up and did the same
the frenchman made some resistance and nearly strangled $beppo$ but he could not resist five armed #man# and was forced to yield
they made him get out walk along the banks of the river and then brought him to $teresa$ and $luigi_vampa$ who were waiting for him in the catacombs of st sebastian
at the same #time# four of the band who were concealed on the banks of the almo surrounded the #carriage#
well said the #count# turning towards $m_franz_de_quesnel$ it seems to me that this is a very likely #story# what do you say to it
why that i should think it very amusing replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ if it had happened to #anyone# but poor $m_albert_de_morcerf$
and in #truth# if you had not found me here said the #count# it might have proved a gallant adventure which would have cost your #friend# dear but now be assured his alarm #will# be the only serious consequence
and shall we go and find him inquired $m_franz_de_quesnel$ oh decidedly #sir# he is in a very picturesque #place#
do you know the catacombs of st sebastian i was never in them but i have often resolved to #visit# them
well here is an opportunity made to your #hand# and it would be difficult to contrive a better have you a #carriage#
no that is of no consequence i always have #one# ready #day# and #night# always ready
i am a very capricious being and i should tell you that sometimes when i rise or after my #dinner# or in the middle of the #night# i resolve on starting for some particular #point# and away i go
yes the #count# rang and a footman appeared #order# out the #carriage# he said and remove the #pistol# which are in the holsters
you need not awaken the coachman $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ #will# drive in a very short #time# the #noise# of wheels was heard and the #carriage# stopped at the #door#
we might start at five clock and be in #time# but the delay may cause your #friend# to pass an uneasy #night# and therefore we had better go with all speed to extricate him from the #hand# of the infidels
the #count# took out his watch #half# past twelve he said are you still resolved to accompany me more determined than ever
well then come along $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and the #count# went downstairs accompanied by $peppino$ at the #door# they found the #carriage#
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ was on the #box# in whom $m_franz_de_quesnel$ recognized the dumb slave of the grotto of $m_de_monte_cristo$ $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and the #count# got into the #carriage#
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ had received his instructions and went down the corso crossed the campo vaccino went up the strada san gregorio and reached the #gate# of st sebastian
then the porter raised some difficulties but the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ produced a permit from the #governor# of rome allowing him to leave or enter the city at any #hour# of the #day# or #night# the portcullis was therefore raised the porter had a $louis_xviii$ for his trouble and they went on their #way#
$peppino$ placed himself beside $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and they set off at a rapid pace the #road# which the #carriage# now traversed was the ancient appian #way# and bordered with tombs
from #time# to #time# by the #light# of the moon which began to rise $m_franz_de_quesnel$ imagined that he saw #something# like a sentinel appear at various #point# among the ruins and suddenly retreat into the #darkness# on a signal from $peppino$
a short #time# before they reached the baths of caracalla the #carriage# stopped $peppino$ opened the #door# and the #count# and $m_franz_de_quesnel$ alighted
he then took $peppino$ aside gave him an #order# in a low #voice# and $peppino$ went away taking with him a torch brought with them in the #carriage#
five #minute# elapsed during which $m_franz_de_quesnel$ saw the shepherd going along a narrow path that led over the irregular and broken surface of the campagna and finally he disappeared in the midst of the tall red herbage which seemed like the bristling mane of an enormous lion
in ten #minute# said the #count# to his #companion# we shall be there now said the #count# let us follow him
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ and the #count# in their #turn# then advanced along the same path which at the #distance# of a hundred paces led them over a declivity to the bottom of a small valley
they then perceived two #man# conversing in the obscurity ought we to go on asked $m_franz_de_quesnel$ of the #count#
or should we pause let us go on $peppino$ #will# have warned the sentry of our coming #one# of the two #man# was $peppino$ and the #other# a #bandit# on the lookout
your #excellency# said $peppino$ addressing the #count# if you #will# follow me the #opening# of the catacombs is close at #hand#
they came to an #opening# behind a clump of bushes and in the midst of a pile of #rock# by which a #man# could scarcely pass
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ and the #count# advanced and the #bandit# saluted them go on then replied the #count# $peppino$ glided first into this crevice after they got along a few paces the passage widened
$peppino$ passed lighted his torch and turned to see if they came after him the #count# first reached an open space and $m_franz_de_quesnel$ followed him closely
the passageway sloped in a gentle descent enlarging as they proceeded still $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and the #count# were compelled to advance in a stooping posture and were scarcely able to proceed abreast of #one# another
they went on a hundred and fifty paces in this #way# and then were stopped by who comes there
a #friend# responded $peppino$ and advancing alone towards the sentry he said a few #word# to him in a low #tone# and then he like the first saluted the nocturnal visitors making a #sign# that they might proceed
at the same #time# they saw the reflection of a torch on a carbine barrel behind the sentinel was a #staircase# with twenty #step#
five corridors diverged like the rays of a star and the #wall# dug into niches which were arranged #one# above the #other# in the shape of coffins showed that they were at last in the catacombs
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ and the #count# descended these and found themselves in a mortuary #chamber# down #one# of the corridors whose extent it was impossible to determine rays of #light# were visible
the #count# laid his #hand# on $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #shoulder# would you like to see a camp of #bandit# in repose he inquired
$peppino$ obeyed and $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and the #count# were in utter #darkness# except that fifty paces in advance of them a reddish glare more evident since $peppino$ had put out his torch was visible along the #wall#
exceedingly replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ come with me then $peppino$ put out the torch they advanced silently the #count# guiding $m_franz_de_quesnel$ as if he had the singular faculty of seeing in the dark
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ himself however saw his #way# more plainly in proportion as he went on towards the #light# which served in some #manner# as a guide
these arcades opened on #one# #side# into the corridor where the #count# and $m_franz_de_quesnel$ were and on the #other# into a large square #chamber# entirely surrounded by niches similar to those of which we have spoken
in the midst of this #chamber# were four #stone# which had formerly served as an altar as was evident from the cross which still surmounted them
a lamp placed at the base of a pillar lighted up with its pale and flickering flame the singular #scene# which presented itself to the #eye# of the two visitors concealed in the #shadow#
a #man# was seated with his elbow leaning on the column and was reading with his back turned to the arcades through the #opening# of which the new comers contemplated him
three arcades were before them and the middle #one# was used as a #door# this was the chief of the band $luigi_vampa$
around him and in groups according to their fancy lying in their mantles or with their backs against a #sort# of #stone# bench which went all round the columbarium were to be seen twenty brigands or more each having his carbine within reach
at the #other# #end# silent scarcely visible and like a #shadow# was a sentinel who was walking up and down before a grotto which was only distinguishable because in that #spot# the #darkness# seemed more dense than elsewhere
when the #count# #thought# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had gazed sufficiently on this picturesque tableau he raised his #finger# to his #lip# to warn him to be silent and ascending the three #step# which led to the corridor of the columbarium entered the #chamber# by the middle arcade and advanced towards $luigi_vampa$ who was so intent on the book before him that he did not hear the #noise# of his footsteps
who comes there cried the sentinel who was less abstracted and who saw by the lamp #light# a #shadow# approaching his chief
at this challenge $luigi_vampa$ rose quickly #drawing# at the same #moment# a #pistol# from his girdle in a #moment# all the #bandit# were on their #foot# and twenty carbines were levelled at the #count#
well said he in a #voice# perfectly calm and no muscle of his #countenance# disturbed well my dear $luigi_vampa$ it appears to me that you receive a #friend# with a great deal of ceremony
#ground# #arm# exclaimed the chief with an imperative #sign# of the #hand# while with the #other# he took off his hat respectfully then turning to the singular personage who had caused this #scene# he said
your pardon your #excellency# but i was so far from expecting the #honor# of a #visit# that i did not really recognize you
it seems that your memory is equally short in #everything# $luigi_vampa$ said the #count# and that not only do you forget #people# #face# but also the conditions you make with them
what conditions have i forgotten your #excellency# inquired the #bandit# with the #air# of a #man# who having committed an error is anxious to repair it
was it not agreed asked the #count# that not only my #person# but also that of my #friend# should be respected by you
and how have i broken that treaty your #excellency# you have this #evening# carried off and conveyed hither the viscount $m_albert_de_morcerf$
well continued the #count# in a #tone# that made $m_franz_de_quesnel$ shudder this young #gentleman# is #one# of my #friend# this young #gentleman# lodges in the same hotel as myself this young #gentleman# has been up and down the corso for eight #hour# in my private #carriage# and yet
i repeat to you you have carried him off and conveyed him hither and added the #count# taking the #letter# from his #pocket#
you have set a ransom on him as if he were an utter #stranger# why did you not tell me all this
why have you caused me thus to fail in my #word# towards a #gentleman# like the #count# who has all our #life# in his #hand#
by heavens if i #thought# #one# of you knew that the young #gentleman# was the #friend# of his #excellency# i would blow his brains out with my own #hand#
you inquired the brigand chief turning towards his #man# who all retreated before his #look# well said the #count# turning towards $m_franz_de_quesnel$
i am with the #person# to whom this #letter# was addressed and to whom i desired to prove that $luigi_vampa$ was a #man# of his #word#
come your #excellency# the #count# added turning to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ here is $luigi_vampa$ who #will# himself express to you his deep regret at the mistake he has committed
i told you there was some mistake in this are you not alone asked $luigi_vampa$ with uneasiness
you heard what the #count# just said and also my reply let me add that i would not for the four thousand piastres at which i had fixed your #friend#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ approached the chief advancing several #step# to meet him welcome among us your #excellency# he said to him ransom that this had happened
but said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ looking round him uneasily where is the viscount i do not see him #nothing# has happened to him i #hope# said the #count# frowningly
the #prisoner# is there replied $luigi_vampa$ pointing to the hollow space in front of which the #bandit# was on guard
and i #will# go myself and tell him he is free the chief went towards the #place# he had pointed out as $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #prison# and $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and the #count# followed him
what is the #prisoner# doing inquired $luigi_vampa$ of the sentinel ma foi #captain# replied the sentry
i do not know for the last #hour# i have not heard him stir come in your #excellency# said $luigi_vampa$
the #count# and $m_franz_de_quesnel$ ascended seven or eight #step# after the chief who drew back a bolt and opened a #door#
then by the gleam of a lamp similar to that which lighted the columbarium $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was to be seen wrapped up in a cloak which #one# of the #bandit# had lent him lying in a #corner# in profound slumber
come said the #count# smiling with his own peculiar #smile# not so bad for a #man# who is to be shot at seven clock #tomorrow# #morning#
$luigi_vampa$ looked at $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with a kind of admiration he was not insensible to such a #proof# of courage
you are #right# your #excellency# he said this must be #one# of your #friend# then going to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he touched him on the #shoulder# saying #will# your #excellency# please to awaken
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ stretched out his #arm# rubbed his eyelids and opened his #eye# oh said he is it you #captain# you should have allowed me to sleep
i had such a delightful #dream# i was dancing the galop at torlonia with the #countess# then he drew his watch from his #pocket# that he might see how #time# sped
#half# past #one# only said he why the devil do you rouse me at this #hour# to tell you that you are free your #excellency#
never awaken me but for bad news if you had let me sleep on i should have finished my galop and have been grateful to you all my #life#
my dear #fellow# replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with perfect ease of #mind# remember for the future $napoleon$ maxim so then they have paid my ransom
no your #excellency# well then how am i free a #person# to whom i can refuse #nothing# has come to demand you
come hither yes hither really then that #person# is a most amiable #person# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ looked around and perceived $m_franz_de_quesnel$
what said he is it you my dear $m_franz_de_quesnel$ whose devotion and friendship are thus displayed no not i replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ but
our neighbor the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ oh my dear #count# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ gayly arranging his cravat and wristbands
you are really most kind and i #hope# you #will# consider me as under eternal obligations to you in the first #place# for the #carriage# and in the next for this #visit# and he put out his #hand# to the #count# who shuddered as he gave his own but who nevertheless did give it
the #bandit# gazed on this #scene# with amazement he was evidently accustomed to see his #prisoner# tremble before him and yet here was #one# whose gay temperament was not for a #moment# altered as for $m_franz_de_quesnel$ he was enchanted at the #way# in which $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had sustained the national #honor# in the #presence# of the #bandit#
my dear $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he said if you #will# make haste we shall yet have #time# to finish the #night# at torlonia
you may conclude your interrupted galop so that you #will# owe no ill #will# to signor $luigi_vampa$ who has indeed throughout this whole #affair# acted like a #gentleman#
you are decidedly #right# and we may reach the palazzo by two clock signor $luigi_vampa$ continued $m_albert_de_morcerf$ is there any formality to fulfil before i take leave of your #excellency#
none #sir# replied the #bandit# you are as free as #air# well then a happy and merry #life# to you
and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ followed by $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and the #count# descended the #staircase# crossed the square #chamber# where stood all the #bandit# hat in #hand#
come #gentleman# come $peppino$ said the brigand chief give me the torch what are you going to do inquired the #count#
i #will# show you the #way# back myself said the #captain# that is the least #honor# that i can render to your #excellency#
and taking the lighted torch from the #hand# of the herdsman he preceded his #guest# not as a #servant# who performs an act of civility but
and now your #excellency# added he allow me to repeat my apologies and i #hope# you #will# not entertain any resentment at what has occurred
like a #king# who precedes ambassadors on reaching the #door# he bowed no my dear $luigi_vampa$ replied the #count#
besides you compensate for your mistakes in so gentlemanly a #way# that #one# almost feels obliged to you for having committed them
#gentleman# added the chief turning towards the young #man# perhaps the offer may not appear very tempting to you but if you should ever feel inclined to pay me a second #visit# wherever i may be you shall be welcome
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ bowed the #count# went out first then $m_albert_de_morcerf$ $m_franz_de_quesnel$ paused for a #moment# has your #excellency# #anything# to ask me said $luigi_vampa$ with a #smile#
yes i have replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ i am curious to know what #work# you were perusing with so much #attention# as we entered
$cæsar_borgia$ commentaries said the #bandit# it is my favorite #work# well are you coming asked $m_albert_de_morcerf$
yes replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ here i am and he in his #turn# left the caves they advanced to the plain
ah your pardon said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ turning round #will# you allow me #captain# and he lighted his cigar at $luigi_vampa$ torch
now my dear #count# he said let us on with all the speed we may i am enormously anxious to finish my #night# at the duke of bracciano
they found the #carriage# where they had left it the #count# said a #word# in arabic to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and the #horse# went on at great speed
it was just two clock by $m_albert_de_morcerf$ watch when the two #friend# entered into the dancing #room# their #return# was quite an #event# but as they entered together all uneasiness on $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #account# ceased instantly
#yesterday# you were so condescending as to #promise# me a galop i am rather late in claiming this gracious #promise# but here is my #friend# whose character for veracity you well know and he #will# assure you the delay arose from no fault of mine
and as at this #moment# the orchestra gave the signal for the waltz $m_albert_de_morcerf$ put his #arm# round the waist of the #countess# and disappeared with her in the whirl of dancers
in the meanwhile $m_franz_de_quesnel$ was considering the singular shudder that had passed over the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ at the #moment# when he had been in some #sort# forced to give his #hand# to $m_albert_de_morcerf$
the first #word# that $m_albert_de_morcerf$ uttered to his #friend# on the following #morning# contained a request that $m_franz_de_quesnel$ would accompany him on a #visit# to the #count# true the young #man# had warmly and energetically thanked the #count# on the previous #evening# but #service# such as he had rendered could never be too often acknowledged
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ who seemed attracted by some invisible influence towards the #count# in which #terror# was strangely mingled felt an extreme reluctance to permit his #friend# to be exposed alone to the singular fascination that this mysterious personage seemed to exercise over him and therefore made no objection to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ request but at once accompanied him to the desired #spot# and after a short delay the #count# joined them in the salon
my dear #count# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ advancing to meet him permit me to repeat the poor #thank# i offered last #night# and to assure you that the remembrance of all i owe to you #will# never be effaced from my memory believe me as long as i live i shall never cease to dwell with grateful recollection on the prompt and important #service# you rendered me and also to remember that to you i am indebted even for my #life#
#madame# said the viscount of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ advancing towards the #countess# #chapter# the rendezvous my very good #friend# and excellent neighbor replied the #count# with a #smile#
you owe me #nothing# but some trifle of #franc# which you have been saved out of your travelling expenses so that there is not much of a score between us but
you must really permit me to congratulate you on the ease and unconcern with which you resigned yourself to your fate and the perfect indifference you manifested as to the #turn# #event# might take
i deserve no credit for what i could not help namely a determination to take #everything# as i found it and to let those #bandit# see that although #man# get into troublesome scrapes all over the #world# there is no nation but the french that can #smile# even in the #face# of grim #death# himself
all that however has #nothing# to do with my obligations to you and i now come to ask you whether in my own #person# my #family# or connections i can in any #way# serve you
my #father# the comte de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ although of spanish origin possesses considerable influence both at the #court# of france and madrid and i unhesitatingly #place# the best #service# of myself and all to whom my #life# is dear at your disposal
you really exaggerate my trifling exertions upon my #word# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ replied the #count#
your offer far from surprising me is precisely what i expected from you and i accept it in the same spirit of hearty sincerity with which it is made nay i #will# go still further and say that i had previously made up my #mind# to ask a great favor at your #hand#
oh pray #name# it i am wholly a #stranger# to paris it is a city i have never yet seen
is it possible exclaimed $m_albert_de_morcerf$ that you have reached your present #age# without visiting the finest capital in the #world#
nevertheless it is quite true still i agree with you in thinking that my present ignorance of the first city in europe is a reproach to me in every #way# and calls for immediate correction but in all probability i should have performed so important so necessary a #duty# as that of making myself acquainted with the wonders and beauties of your justly celebrated capital had i known any #person# who would have introduced me into the fashionable #world# but unfortunately i possessed no acquaintance there and of necessity was compelled to abandon the #idea#
i can scarcely credit it so distinguished an individual as yourself cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$ could scarcely have required an introduction
you are most kind but as regards myself i can find no merit i possess save that as a millionaire i might have become a partner in the speculations of aguado and rothschild but as my motive in travelling to your capital would not have been for the #pleasure# of dabbling in stocks i stayed away till some favorable #chance# should present itself of carrying my #wish# into execution
these #word# were accompanied by a most peculiar #smile# whether you undertake upon my arrival in france to open to me the #door# of that fashionable #world# of which i know no more than a huron or a native of cochin china
your offer however smooths all difficulties and i have only to ask you my dear de $m_albert_de_morcerf$
oh that i do and with infinite #pleasure# answered $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and so much the more readily as a #letter# received this #morning# from my #father#
summons me to paris in consequence of a treaty of #marriage# my dear $m_franz_de_quesnel$ do not #smile# i beg of you with a #family# of high standing and connected with the very cream of parisian society
connected by #marriage# you #mean# said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ laughingly well never #mind# how it is answered $m_albert_de_morcerf$ it comes to the same #thing# in the #end#
perhaps by the #time# you #return# to paris i shall be quite a sober staid #father# of a #family# a most edifying representative i shall make of all the domestic virtues
but as regards your #wish# to #visit# our fine city my dear #count# i can only say that you may command me and mine to any extent you please
and i give you my solemn assurance that i only waited an opportunity like the present to realize #plan# that i have long meditated
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ did not #doubt# that these #plan# were the same concerning which the #count# had dropped a few #word# in the grotto of $m_de_monte_cristo$ and while the #count# was speaking the young #man# watched him closely hoping to read #something# of his #purpose# in his #face# but his #countenance# was inscrutable especially when as in the present #case# it was veiled in a sphinx like #smile#
but tell me now #count# exclaimed $m_albert_de_morcerf$ delighted at the #idea# of having to chaperon so distinguished a #person# as $m_de_monte_cristo$ tell me truly whether you are in earnest or if this project of visiting paris is merely #one# of the chimerical and uncertain #air# castles of which we make so many in the #course# of our #life# but which like a $house_of_peers$ built on the sand is liable to be blown over by the first puff of wind
i pledge you my #honor# returned the #count# that i #mean# to do as i have said both inclination and positive necessity compel me to #visit# paris
dont you think so then it is settled said the #count# when do you propose going thither
certainly i have in a fortnight or three weeks #time# that is to say as fast as i can get there
nay said the #count# i #will# give you three #month# ere i join you you see i make an ample allowance for all delays and difficulties
have you made up your #mind# when you shall be there yourself and in three #month# #time# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ you #will# be at my $house_of_peers$
inquired the #count# only let me warn you that i am proverbial for my punctilious exactitude in keeping my engagements
shall we make a positive appointment for a particular #day# and #hour# #day# for #day# #hour# for #hour# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
so be it then replied the #count# and extending his #hand# towards a calendar suspended near the chimney #piece# he said #today# is the st of february and #drawing# out his watch added
that #will# suit me to a dot it is exactly #half# past ten clock now #promise# me to remember this and expect me the st of may at the same #hour# in the forenoon
capital exclaimed $m_albert_de_morcerf$ your breakfast shall be waiting where do you live no $rue_du_helder$
have you bachelor #apartment# there i #hope# my coming #will# not put you to any inconvenience i reside in my #father#
$house_of_peers$ but occupy a pavilion at the farther #side# of the courtyard entirely separated from the main building
quite sufficient replied the #count# as taking out his tablets he wrote down no $rue_du_helder$ st may #half# past ten in the #morning#
now then said the #count# returning his tablets to his #pocket# make yourself perfectly easy the #hand# of your #time# #piece# #will# not be more accurate in marking the #time# than myself
shall i see you again ere my departure asked $m_albert_de_morcerf$ that depends when do you leave
in that #case# i must say adieu to you as i am compelled to go to naples and shall not #return# hither before saturday #evening# or sunday #morning#
#tomorrow# #evening# at five clock and you #baron# pursued the #count# addressing $m_franz_de_quesnel$ do you also depart #tomorrow#
yes for france no for venice i shall remain in italy for another #year# or two
well since we must #part# said the #count# holding out a #hand# to each of the young #man# allow me to #wish# you both a safe and pleasant journey
then we shall not meet in paris i #fear# i shall not have that #honor#
it was the first #time# the #hand# of $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had come in contact with that of the mysterious individual before him and unconsciously he shuddered at its touch for it felt cold and icy as that of a corpse
not that you are to be at no in the $rue_du_helder$ on the st of may at #half# past ten in the #morning# and your #word# of #honor# passed for your punctuality
let us understand each #other# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ it is agreed is it the st of may at #half# past ten in the #morning# $rue_du_helder$ no replied the #count#
what is the #matter# asked $m_albert_de_morcerf$ of $m_franz_de_quesnel$ when they had returned to their own #apartment# you seem more than commonly thoughtful
the young #man# then rose and bowing to the #count# quitted the #room# i #will# confess to you $m_albert_de_morcerf$ replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$
the #count# is a very singular #person# and the appointment you have made to meet him in paris fills me with a thousand apprehensions
my dear #fellow# exclaimed $m_albert_de_morcerf$ what can there possibly be in that to excite uneasiness why you must have lost your senses
whether i am in my senses or not answered $m_franz_de_quesnel$ that is the #way# i feel listen to me $m_franz_de_quesnel$ said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
i am glad that the occasion has presented itself for saying this to you for i have noticed how cold you are in your bearing towards the #count# while he on the #other# #hand# has always been courtesy itself to us
have you #anything# particular against him possibly did you ever meet him previously to coming hither
i have and where #will# you #promise# me not to repeat a single #word# of what i am about to tell you
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ then related to his #friend# the history of his excursion to the #island# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ and of his finding a party of smugglers there and the two corsican #bandit# with them
he dwelt with considerable force and energy on the almost magical hospitality he had received from the #count# and the magnificence of his entertainment in the grotto of the thousand and #one# #night#
he recounted with circumstantial exactitude all the particulars of the supper the hashish the statues the #dream# and how at his awakening there remained no #proof# or trace of all these #event# save the small yacht seen in the distant horizon driving under full sail toward porto vecchio
then he detailed the #conversation# overheard by him at the colosseum between the #count# and $luigi_vampa$ in which the #count# had promised to obtain the release of the #bandit# $peppino$ an engagement which as our readers are aware he most faithfully fulfilled
at last he arrived at the adventure of the preceding #night# and the embarrassment in which he found himself placed by not having sufficient cash by six or seven hundred piastres to make up the #sum# required and finally of his application to the #count# and the picturesque and satisfactory result that followed
i #promise# upon your #honor# upon my #honor# then listen to me $m_albert_de_morcerf$ listened with the most profound #attention#
well said he when $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had concluded what do you find to object to in all you have related the #count# is fond of travelling and being rich possesses a #vessel# of his own
go but to portsmouth or southampton and you #will# find the harbors crowded with the yachts belonging to such of the english as can afford the expense and have the same liking for this amusement
now by #way# of having a resting #place# during his excursions avoiding the wretched cookery which has been trying its best to #poison# me during the last four #month# while you have manfully resisted its #effect# for as many #year# and obtaining a #bed# on which it is possible to slumber $m_de_monte_cristo$ has furnished for himself a temporary abode where you first found him but to prevent the possibility of the tuscan government taking a fancy to his enchanted palace and thereby depriving him of the advantages naturally expected from so large an outlay of capital he has wisely enough purchased the #island# and taken its #name#
just ask yourself my good #fellow# whether there are not many #person# of our acquaintance who assume the #name# of lands and properties they never in their #life# were #master# of
but said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ the corsican #bandit# that were among the crew of his #vessel# why really the #thing# seems to me simple enough
nobody knows better than yourself that the #bandit# of corsica are not rogues or thieves but purely and simply fugitives driven by some sinister motive from their native town or village and that their fellowship involves no disgrace or stigma for my own #part# i protest that should i ever go to corsica my first #visit#
ere even i presented myself to the mayor or prefect should be to the #bandit# of colomba if i could only manage to find them for on my conscience they are a race of #man# i admire greatly
i suppose you #will# allow that such #man# as $luigi_vampa$ and his band are regular villains who have no #other# motive than plunder when they seize your #person#
still persisted $m_franz_de_quesnel$ how do you explain the influence the #count# evidently possessed over those ruffians
my good #friend# as in all probability i own my present safety to that influence it would ill become me to search too closely into its source therefore instead of condemning him for his intimacy with outlaws you must give me leave to excuse any little irregularity there may be in such a connection not altogether for preserving my #life# for my own #idea# was that it never was in much danger but certainly for saving me piastres which being translated #mean# neither more nor less than livres of our #money# a #sum# at which most assuredly i should never have been estimated in france proving most indisputably added $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with a laugh that no prophet is honored in his own #country#
talking of #country# replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ of what #country# is the #count# what is his native tongue whence does he derive his immense #fortune# and what were those #event# of his early #life# a #life# as marvellous as unknown that have tinctured his succeeding #year# with so dark and gloomy a misanthropy
my dear $m_franz_de_quesnel$ replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ when upon receipt of my #letter# you found the necessity of asking the #count# assistance you promptly went to him saying my #friend# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ is in danger help me to deliver him
certainly these are #question# that in your #place# i should like to have answered was not that nearly what you said
it was well then did he ask you who is $m_albert_de_morcerf$ how does he come by his #name#
his #fortune# what are his #mean# of existence what is his birthplace of what #country# is he a native tell me did he put all these #question# to you
no he merely came and freed me from the #hand# of signor $luigi_vampa$ where i can assure you in #spite# of all my outward #appearance# of ease and unconcern
now then $m_franz_de_quesnel$ when for #service# so promptly and unhesitatingly rendered he but asks me in #return# to do for him what is done daily for any russian prince or italian nobleman who may pass through paris merely to introduce him into society
i confess he asked me none i did not very particularly #care# to remain would you have me refuse
my good #fellow# you must have lost your senses to think it possible i could act with such cold blooded policy
and this #time# it must be confessed that #contrary# to the usual state of #affair# in discussions between the young #man# the effective arguments were all on $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #side#
well said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ with a sigh do as you please my dear viscount for your arguments are beyond my #power# of refutation
still in #spite# of all you must admit that this #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ is a most singular personage
he is a philanthropist answered the #other# and no #doubt# his motive in visiting paris is to compete for the monthyon prize given as you are aware to whoever shall be proved to have most materially advanced the #interest# of virtue and humanity
if my vote and #interest# can obtain it for him i #will# readily give him the #one# and #promise# the #other#
and now my dear $m_franz_de_quesnel$ let us talk of #something# else come shall we take our luncheon and then pay a last #visit# to st peter
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ silently assented and the following afternoon at #half# past five clock the young #man# parted $m_albert_de_morcerf$ to #return# to paris and $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay to pass a fortnight at venice
but ere he entered his travelling #carriage# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ fearing that his expected #guest# might forget the engagement he had entered into placed in the #care# of a waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ on which beneath the #name# of viscount $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he had written in pencil
in the $house_of_peers$ in the $rue_du_helder$ where $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had invited the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ #everything# was being prepared on the #morning# of the st of may to do #honor# to the occasion
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ inhabited a pavilion situated at the #corner# of a large #court# and directly opposite another building in which were the #servant# #apartment#
two #window# only of the pavilion faced the #street# three #other# #window# looked into the #court# and two at the back into the #garden#
between the #court# and the #garden# built in the heavy style of the imperial architecture was the large and fashionable dwelling of the #count# and #countess# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$
a high #wall# surrounded the whole of the property surmounted at intervals by vases filled with flowers and broken in the centre by a large #gate# of gilded #iron# which served as the #carriage# entrance
a small #door# close to the lodge of the concierge gave ingress and egress to the #servant# and #master# when they were on #foot#
it was easy to discover that the delicate #care# of a #mother# unwilling to #part# from her #son# and yet aware that a young #man# of the viscount #age# required the full exercise of his #liberty# had chosen this habitation for $m_albert_de_morcerf$
there were not lacking however evidences of what we may call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent careless #life# of an only #son# and who #life# as it were in a gilded cage
by #mean# of the two #window# looking into the #street# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ could see all that passed the #sight# of what is going on is necessary to young #man# who always want to see the #world# traverse their horizon even if that horizon is only a public thoroughfare
then should #anything# appear to merit a more #minute# examination $m_albert_de_morcerf$ could follow up his researches by #mean# of a small #gate# similar to that close to the concierge #door# and which merits a particular description
it was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the $house_of_peers$ was built so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt but the well oiled hinges and locks told quite another #story#
this #door# was a mockery to the concierge from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was free and like that famous portal in the arabian #night# #opening# at the sesame of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ baba it was wont to swing backward at a cabalistic #word# or a concerted tap from without from the sweetest #voice# or whitest #finger# in the #world#
at the #end# of a long corridor with which the #door# communicated and which formed the antechamber was on the #right# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ breakfast #room# looking into the #court# and on the left the salon looking into the #garden#
shrubs and creeping plants covered the #window# and hid from the #garden# and #court# these two #apartment# the only #room# into which as they were on the #ground# #floor# the prying #eye# of the curious could penetrate
on the #floor# above were similar #room# with the addition of a third formed out of the antechamber these three #room# were a salon a boudoir and a bedroom
$rue_du_helder$ on the st may #half# past ten a #chapter# the #guest# the salon downstairs was only an algerian divan for the #use# of smokers
the boudoir upstairs communicated with the bedchamber by an invisible #door# on the #staircase# it was evident that every precaution had been taken
above this #floor# was a large atelier which had been increased in size by pulling down the partitions a pandemonium in which the artist and the dandy strove for pre eminence
there were collected and piled up all $m_albert_de_morcerf$ successive caprices hunting horns bass viols flutes a whole orchestra for $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had had not a taste but a fancy for music easels palettes brushes pencils for music had been succeeded by painting foils boxing gloves broadswords and single sticks for following the example of the fashionable young #man# of the #time# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ cultivated with far more perseverance than music and #drawing# the three arts that complete a dandy education i fencing boxing and single stick and
the #rest# of the furniture of this privileged #apartment# consisted of old cabinets filled with chinese porcelain and japanese vases lucca della robbia faïences and palissy platters of old armchairs in which perhaps had sat henry iv
or richelieu for two of these armchairs adorned with a carved shield on which were engraved the fleur de lis of france on an azure field evidently came from the louvre or at least some royal residence
over these dark and sombre #chair# were thrown splendid stuffs dyed beneath persia sun or woven by the #finger# of the #woman# of calcutta or of chandernagor
what these stuffs did there it was impossible to say they awaited while gratifying the #eye# a destination unknown to their owner himself in the meantime they filled the #place# with their golden and silky reflections
it was here that he received grisier cooks and charles leboucher or sully $louis_xviii$ xiii in the centre of the #room# was a roller and blanchet
baby grand piano in rosewood but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its narrow and sonorous cavity and groaning beneath the weight of the chefs œuvre of beethoven weber mozart haydn grétry and porpora
on the #wall# over the #door# on the ceiling were swords daggers malay creeses maces battle axes gilded damasked and inlaid suits of armor dried plants minerals and stuffed birds their flame colored wings outspread in motionless flight and their beaks forever open
this was $m_albert_de_morcerf$ favorite lounging #place# however the #morning# of the appointment the young #man# had established himself in the small salon downstairs
there on a #table# surrounded at some #distance# by a large and luxurious divan every species of tobacco known from the yellow tobacco of petersburg to the black of sinai and so on along the scale from maryland and porto rico to latakia was exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the dutch are so fond beside them in #box# of fragrant wood were ranged according to their size and quality puros regalias havanas and manillas and in an open cabinet a collection of german pipes of chibouques with their amber mouth #piece# ornamented with coral and of narghiles with their long tubes of morocco awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the smokers
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ had himself presided at the arrangement or rather the symmetrical derangement which after coffee the #guest# at a breakfast of modern #day# #love# to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from their mouths and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling
at a #quarter# to ten a #valet# entered he composed with a little groom named john and who only spoke english all $m_albert_de_morcerf$ establishment although the cook of the hotel was always at his #service# and on great occasions the #count# chasseur also
this #valet# whose #name# was germain and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young #master# held in #one# #hand# a number of #paper# and in the #other# a packet of #letter# which he gave to $m_albert_de_morcerf$
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ glanced carelessly at the different missives selected two written in a small and delicate #hand# and enclosed in scented envelopes opened them and perused their contents with some #attention#
how did these #letter# come said he #one# by the post #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ footman left the #other# let #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ know that i accept the #place# she offers me in her #box#
wait then during the #day# tell rosa that when i leave the opera i #will# sup with her as she #wish#
take her six bottles of different wine cyprus sherry and malaga and a barrel of ostend oysters get them at borel and be sure you say they are for me
at what clock #sir# do you breakfast what #time# is it now a #quarter# to ten
very well at #half# past ten $m_lucien_debray$ #will# perhaps be obliged to go to the #minister# and besides $m_albert_de_morcerf$ looked at his tablets
it is the #hour# i told the #count# st may at #half# past ten and though i do not much rely upon his #promise# i #wish# to be punctual
yes ask her for #one# of her liqueur cellarets mine is incomplete and tell her i shall have the #honor# of seeing her about three clock and that i request permission to introduce someone to her
is the #countess# up yet if you #wish# i #will# inquire the #valet# left the #room#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ threw himself on the divan tore off the cover of two or three of the #paper# looked at the theatre announcements made a #face# seeing they gave an opera and not a ballet hunted vainly amongst the advertisements for a new tooth powder of which he had heard and threw down #one# after the #other# the three leading #paper# of paris muttering
these #paper# become more and more stupid every #day# a #moment# after a #carriage# stopped before the #door# and the #servant# announced $m_lucien_debray$
a tall young #man# with #light# #hair# clear gray #eye# and thin and compressed #lip# dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved #gold# buttons a white neckcloth and a tortoiseshell #eye# #glass# suspended by a silken thread and which by an #effort# of the superciliary and zygomatic muscles he fixed in his #eye# entered with a #half# official #air# without smiling or speaking
good #morning# $m_lucien_debray$ good #morning# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ your punctuality really alarms me what do i say punctuality you whom i expected last you arrive at five #minute# to ten when the #time# fixed was #half# past
no my dear #fellow# returned the young #man# seating himself on the divan reassure yourself we are tottering always but we never fall and i begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of immobility and then the #affair# of the peninsula #will# completely consolidate us
has the ministry resigned ah true you drive $don_carlos$ out of spain no no my dear #fellow# do not confound our #plan#
we take him to the #other# #side# of the french frontier and offer him hospitality at bourges at bourges
do you not know that all paris knew it #yesterday# and the #day# before it had already transpired on the bourse and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i do not know by what #mean# that #man# contrives to obtain intelligence as soon as we do made a #million#
yes he has not much to complain of bourges is the capital of charles vii and you another #order# for i see you have a blue ribbon at your button hole
yes they sent me the #order# of charles iii returned $m_lucien_debray$ carelessly come do not affect indifference but confess you were pleased to have it
oh it is very well as a finish to the toilet it #look# very neat on a black coat buttoned up
and makes you resemble the prince of wales or the duke of reichstadt it is for that #reason# you see me so early
because you have the #order# of charles iii and you #wish# to announce the good news to me
i returned home at daybreak and strove to sleep but my #head# ached and i got up to have a ride for an #hour#
at the bois de boulogne ennui and hunger attacked me at once two #enemy# who rarely accompany each #other# and who are yet leagued against me a #sort# of carlo republican alliance
no because i passed the #night# writing #letter# five and twenty despatches i then recollected you gave a breakfast this #morning# and here i am
it is my #duty# as your host returned $m_albert_de_morcerf$ ringing the bell while $m_lucien_debray$ turned over with his #gold# mounted cane the #paper# that lay on the #table#
i am hungry feed me i am bored amuse me germain a #glass# of sherry and a biscuit
in the meantime my dear $m_lucien_debray$ here are cigars contraband of #course# try them and persuade the #minister# to sell us such instead of poisoning us with cabbage leaves
peste i #will# do #nothing# of the kind the #moment# they come from government you would find them execrable
besides that does not concern the home but the financial department address yourself to humann section of the indirect contributions corridor a no
on my #word# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ you astonish me by the extent of your knowledge take a cigar
really my dear $m_albert_de_morcerf$ replied $m_lucien_debray$ lighting a manilla at a rose colored taper that burnt in a beautifully enamelled stand how happy you are to have #nothing# to do
and what would you do my dear diplomatist replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with a slight degree of irony in his #voice# if you did #nothing#
private secretary to a #minister# plunged at once into european cabals and parisian intrigues having #king# and better still queens to protect parties to unite elections to direct making more #use# of your cabinet with your pen and your telegraph than
you do not know your own good #fortune# what $napoleon$ did of his battle fields with his sword and his victories possessing five and twenty thousand #franc# a #year# besides your #place#
a #horse# for which $baron_de_château_renaud$ offered you four hundred $louis_xviii$ and which you would not #part# with a tailor who never disappoints you with the opera the jockey club and #other# diversions can you not amuse yourself
well i #will# amuse you how by introducing to you a new acquaintance a #man# or a #woman#
a #man# i know so many #man# already but you do not know this #man#
where does he come from the #end# of the #world# farther still perhaps the deuce i #hope# he does not bring our breakfast with him
oh no our breakfast comes from my #father# kitchen are you hungry humiliating as such a confession is i am
but i dined at $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and lawyers always give you very bad #dinner# you would think they felt some remorse did you ever remark that
ah depreciate #other# #person# #dinner# you #minister# give such splendid #one# yes but we do not invite #people# of fashion
if we were not forced to entertain a parcel of #country# boobies because they think and vote with us we should never #dream# of dining at home i assure you
well take another #glass# of sherry and another biscuit willingly your spanish wine is excellent you see we were quite #right# to pacify that #country#
yes but $don_carlos$ well $don_carlos$ #will# drink bordeaux and in ten #year# we #will# marry his #son# to the little queen
you #will# then obtain the golden fleece if you are still in the ministry i think $m_albert_de_morcerf$ you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke this #morning#
well you must allow it is the best #thing# for the stomach but i hear $m_beauchamp$ in the next #room# you can dispute together and that #will# pass away the #time#
about what about the #paper# my dear #friend# said $m_lucien_debray$ with an #air# of sovereign contempt do i ever read the #paper#
then you #will# dispute the more $m_beauchamp$ announced the #servant# come in come in said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ rising and advancing to meet the young #man#
here is $m_lucien_debray$ who detests you without reading you so he says he is quite #right# returned $m_beauchamp$
for i criticise him without knowing what he does good #day# commander ah you know that already said the private secretary smiling and shaking #hand# with him
$pardieu$ and what do they say of it in the #world# in which #world# we have so many #world# in the #year# of grace
in the entire political #world# of which you are #one# of the leaders they say that it is quite fair and that sowing so much red you ought to reap a little blue
come come that is not bad said $m_lucien_debray$ why do you not join our party my dear $m_beauchamp$ with your talents you would make your #fortune# in three or four #year#
i only await #one# #thing# before following your advice that is a #minister# who #will# hold office for six #month#
my dear $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #one# #word# for i must give poor $m_lucien_debray$ a respite do we breakfast or dine i must go to the #chamber# for our #life# is not an idle #one#
you only breakfast i await two #person# and the #instant# they arrive we shall sit down to #table#
#chapter# the breakfast and what #sort# of #person# do you expect to breakfast said $m_beauchamp$ a #gentleman# and a diplomatist
then we shall have to wait two #hour# for the #gentleman# and three for the diplomatist i shall come back to dessert keep me some strawberries coffee and cigars
do not do #anything# of the #sort# for were the #gentleman# a montmorency and the diplomatist a metternich we #will# breakfast at eleven in the meantime follow $m_lucien_debray$ example and take a #glass# of sherry and a biscuit
i shall take a cutlet on my #way# to the #chamber# be it so i #will# stay i must do #something# to distract my #thought#
you are like $m_lucien_debray$ and yet it seems to me that when the #minister# is out of spirits the opposition ought to be joyous
i shall hear this #morning# that $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ make a speech at the #chamber# of deputies and at his #wife# this #evening# i shall hear the tragedy of a peer of france
the devil take the constitutional government and since we had our choice as they say at least how could we choose that
ah you do not know with what i am threatened i understand you must lay in a stock of hilarity
do not run down $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ speeches said $m_lucien_debray$ he votes for you for he belongs to the opposition
$pardieu$ that is exactly the worst of all i am waiting until you send him to speak at the luxembourg to laugh at my ease
my dear #friend# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ to $m_beauchamp$ it is plain that the #affair# of spain are settled for you are most desperately out of humor this #morning#
i cannot in conscience therefore let you run down the speeches of a #man# who #will# #one# #day# say to me
recollect that parisian gossip has spoken of a #marriage# between myself and mlle $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ vicomte you know i give my #daughter# two #million#
the #king# has made him a #baron# and can make him a peer but he cannot make him a #gentleman# and the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ is too aristocratic to consent for the paltry #sum# of two #million# #franc# to a mésalliance
ah this #marriage# #will# never take #place# said $m_beauchamp$ the viscount of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ can only wed a marchioness
it is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard or a railroad from the jardin des plantes to la râpée
but two #million# #franc# make a nice little #sum# replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ never #mind# what he says $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said $m_lucien_debray$ do you marry her
you marry a #money# bag label it is true well but what does that #matter# it is better to have a blazon less and a figure more on it
you have seven martlets on your #arm# give three to your #wife# and you #will# still have four that is #one# more than de guise had who so nearly became #king# of france and whose cousin was emperor of germany
on my #word# i think you are #right# $m_lucien_debray$ said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ absently to be sure besides every millionaire is as noble as a bastard
do not say that $m_lucien_debray$ returned $m_beauchamp$ laughing for here is $baron_de_château_renaud$ who to cure you of your mania for paradoxes #will# pass the sword of renaud de montauban his ancestor through your #body#
that is he can be he #will# sully it then returned $m_lucien_debray$ for i am low very low
oh heavens cried $m_beauchamp$ the #minister# quotes béranger what shall we come to next de $baron_de_château_renaud$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ said the #servant# announcing two fresh #guest#
now then to breakfast said $m_beauchamp$ for if i remember you told me you only expected two #person# $m_albert_de_morcerf$
but before he had finished de $baron_de_château_renaud$ a handsome young #man# of thirty #gentleman# all over that is with the figure of a guiche and the wit of a mortemart took $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #hand#
my dear $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said he let me introduce to you $m_maximilian_morrel$ #captain# of spahis my #friend# and what is more
and he stepped on #one# #side# to give #place# to a young #man# of refined and dignified bearing with large and open #brow# piercing #eye# and black moustache whom our readers have already seen at marseilles under #circumstance# sufficiently dramatic not to be forgotten
a rich uniform #half# french #half# oriental set off his graceful and stalwart figure and his broad chest was decorated with the #order# of the legion of #honor#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ muttered $m_albert_de_morcerf$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ who is he however the #man# speaks for himself my preserver salute my hero viscount the young #officer# bowed with easy and elegant politeness
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with affectionate courtesy the #count# of $baron_de_château_renaud$ knew how much #pleasure# this introduction would give me you are his #friend# be ours also
well said interrupted $baron_de_château_renaud$ and pray that if you should ever be in a similar predicament he may do as much for you as he did for me
what has he done asked $m_albert_de_morcerf$ oh #nothing# worth speaking of said $m_maximilian_morrel$ de $baron_de_château_renaud$ exaggerates
not worth speaking of cried $baron_de_château_renaud$ #life# is not worth speaking of that is rather too philosophical on my #word# $m_maximilian_morrel$
it is very well for you who risk your #life# every #day# but for me who only did so once
we gather from all this #baron# that #captain# $m_maximilian_morrel$ saved your #life# exactly so on what occasion asked $m_beauchamp$
$m_beauchamp$ my good #fellow# you know i am starving said $m_lucien_debray$ do not set him off on some long #story#
well i do not prevent your sitting down to #table# replied $m_beauchamp$ $baron_de_château_renaud$ can tell us while we eat our breakfast
#gentleman# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ it is only a #quarter# past ten and i expect someone else ah true a diplomatist
diplomat or not i dont know i only know that he charged himself on my #account# with a mission which he terminated so entirely to my satisfaction that had i been #king# i should have instantly created him knight of all my #order# even had i been able to offer him the golden fleece and the garter
well since we are not to sit down to #table# said $m_lucien_debray$ take a #glass# of sherry and tell us all about it
observed $m_lucien_debray$ you all know that i had the fancy of going to africa
it is a #road# your ancestors have traced for you said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ gallantly yes but i #doubt# that your object was like theirs to rescue the holy sepulchre
i cannot bear duelling ever since two seconds whom i had chosen to arrange an #affair# forced me to break the #arm# of #one# of my best #friend# #one# whom you all know
you are quite #right# $m_beauchamp$ observed the young aristocrat it was only to fight as an amateur poor $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay
ah true said $m_lucien_debray$ you did fight some #time# ago about what the devil take me if i remember returned $baron_de_château_renaud$
but i recollect perfectly #one# #thing# that being unwilling to let such talents as mine sleep i wished to try upon the arabs the new #pistol# that had been given to me
in consequence i embarked for oran and went from thence to constantine where i arrived just in #time# to witness the raising of the siege
i endured the rain during the #day# and the cold during the #night# tolerably well but the third #morning# my #horse# died of cold
poor brute accustomed to be covered up and to have a stove in the stable the arabian finds himself unable to bear ten degrees of cold in arabia
i retreated with the #rest# for eight and forty #hour# that why you want to purchase my english #horse# said $m_lucien_debray$
you think he #will# bear the cold better you are mistaken for i have made a vow never to #return# to africa
you were very much frightened then asked $m_beauchamp$ well yes and i had good #reason# to be so replied $baron_de_château_renaud$
i was retreating on #foot# for my #horse# was dead six arabs came up full gallop to cut off my #head#
i shot two with my double barrelled gun and two more with my #pistol# but i was then disarmed and two were still left #one# seized me by the #hair# that is why i now wear it so short for no #one# knows what may happen the #other# swung a yataghan and i already felt the cold steel on my neck when this #gentleman# whom you see here charged them shot the #one# who held me by the #hair# and cleft the skull of the #other# with his sabre
he had assigned himself the task of saving a #man# #life# that #day# #chance# caused that #man# to be myself when i am rich i #will# #order# a statue of #chance# from klagmann or marochetti
it was the th of september the anniversary of the #day# on which my #father# was miraculously preserved therefore as far as it lies in my #power# i endeavor to celebrate it by some
but that is not all after rescuing me from the sword he rescued me from the cold not by sharing his cloak with me like st martin but by giving me the whole then from hunger by sharing with me guess what
yes said $m_maximilian_morrel$ smiling heroic action interrupted $baron_de_château_renaud$ i was chosen a strasbourg pie
asked $m_beauchamp$ no his #horse# of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty appetite it was very hard
the #horse# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ laughing no the sacrifice returned $baron_de_château_renaud$ ask $m_lucien_debray$ if he would sacrifice his english steed for a #stranger#
not for a #stranger# said $m_lucien_debray$ but for a #friend# i might perhaps i divined that you would become mine #count# replied $m_maximilian_morrel$
besides as i had the #honor# to tell you heroism or not sacrifice or not that #day# i owed an offering to bad #fortune# in recompense for the favors good #fortune# had on #other# #day# granted to us
the history to which $m_maximilian_morrel$ alludes continued $baron_de_château_renaud$ is an admirable #one# which he #will# tell you some #day# when you are better acquainted with him #today# let us fill our stomachs and not our memories
what #time# do you breakfast $m_albert_de_morcerf$ at #half# past ten precisely asked $m_lucien_debray$ taking out his watch
oh you #will# give me five #minute# grace replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ for i also expect a preserver of whom
do you think i cannot be saved as well as #anyone# else and that there are only arabs who cut off #head#
of myself cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$ parbleu our breakfast is a philanthropic #one# and we shall have at #table# at least i #hope# so two benefactors of humanity
what shall we do said $m_lucien_debray$ we have only #one# monthyon prize well it #will# be given to someone who has done #nothing# to deserve it said $m_beauchamp$
that is the #way# the academy mostly escapes from the dilemma and where does he come from asked $m_lucien_debray$
you have already answered the #question# once but so vaguely that i venture to put it a second #time#
really said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i do not know when i invited him three #month# ago he was then at rome but
since that #time# who knows where he may have gone and you think him capable of being exact demanded $m_lucien_debray$
i think him capable of #everything# well with the five #minute# grace we have only ten left
i #will# profit by them to tell you #something# about my #guest# i beg pardon interrupted $m_beauchamp$ are there any materials for an article in what you are going to tell us
go on then for i see i shall not get to the #chamber# this #morning# and i must make up for it
yes and for a most curious #one# i was at rome during the last carnival we know that said $m_beauchamp$
yes but what you do not know is that i was carried off by #bandit# there are no #bandit# cried $m_lucien_debray$
yes there are and most hideous or rather most admirable #one# for i found them ugly enough to frighten me
confess that your cook is behindhand that the oysters have not arrived from ostend or marennes and that like #madame# de maintenon you are going to replace the dish by a #story#
say so at once we are sufficiently well bred to excuse you and to listen to your history fabulous as it #promise# to be
and i say to you fabulous as it may seem i tell it as a true #one# from beginning to #end#
come my dear $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said $m_lucien_debray$ the brigands had carried me off and conducted me to a gloomy #spot# called the catacombs of saint sebastian
i know it said $baron_de_château_renaud$ i narrowly escaped catching a fever there and i did more than that replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ for i caught #one#
i was informed that i was #prisoner# until i paid the #sum# of roman crowns about #franc# unfortunately i had not above
i was at the #end# of my journey and of my credit i wrote to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and were he here he would confirm every #word#
i wrote then to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ that if he did not come with the four thousand crowns before six at ten #minute# past i should have gone to join the blessed saints and glorious martyrs in whose company i had the #honor# of being and signor $luigi_vampa$ such was the #name# of the chief of these #bandit# would have scrupulously kept his #word#
but $m_franz_de_quesnel$ did come with the four thousand crowns said $baron_de_château_renaud$ a #man# whose #name# is $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay or $m_albert_de_morcerf$ has not much difficulty in procuring them
no he arrived accompanied simply by the #guest# i am going to present to you ah this #gentleman# is a hercules killing cacus a perseus freeing andromeda
no he is a #man# about my own size armed to the teeth he had not even a knitting needle
but he paid your ransom he said two #word# to the chief and i was free
and they apologized to him for having carried you off said $m_beauchamp$ just so why he is a second ariosto
no his #name# is the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ there is no #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ said $m_lucien_debray$
i do not think so added $baron_de_château_renaud$ with the #air# of a #man# who knows the whole of the european nobility perfectly
he comes possibly from the holy land and #one# of his ancestors possessed calvary as the mortemarts did the dead #sea#
does #anyone# know #anything# of a #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ i think i can assist your researches said $m_maximilian_morrel$
$m_de_monte_cristo$ is a little #island# i have often heard spoken of by the old #sailor# my #father# employed a grain of sand in the centre of the mediterranean an atom in the infinite
well he of whom i speak is the lord and #master# of this grain of sand of this atom he has purchased the title of #count# somewhere in tuscany
precisely cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he is rich then i believe so but that ought to be visible
that is what deceives you $m_lucien_debray$ i do not understand you have you read the arabian #night#
well do you know if the #person# you see there are rich or poor if their sacks of wheat are not rubies or #diamond#
what a #question# they seem like poor fishermen and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the wealth of the indies
he has even a #name# taken from the book since he calls himself sinbad the #sailor# and has a cave filled with #gold#
which #mean# which #mean# that my #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ is #one# of those fishermen and you have seen this cavern $m_albert_de_morcerf$ asked $m_beauchamp$
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ went in with his #eye# blindfolded and was waited on by mutes and by #woman# to whom cleopatra was a painted strumpet
only he is not quite sure about the #woman# for they did not come in until after he had taken hashish so that what he took for #woman# might have been simply a row of statues
no but $m_franz_de_quesnel$ has for heaven sake not a #word# of this before him the two young #man# looked at $m_albert_de_morcerf$ as if to say are you mad or are you laughing at us
and i also said $m_maximilian_morrel$ thoughtfully have heard #something# like this from an old #sailor# named $penelon$ ah cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$
it is very lucky that $m_maximilian_morrel$ comes to aid me you are vexed are you not that he thus gives a clew to the labyrinth
my dear $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said $m_lucien_debray$ what you tell us is so extraordinary ah because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of them
they have no #time# they are too much taken up with interfering in the #affair# of their countrymen who travel
now you get angry and attack our poor agents how #will# you have them protect you the #chamber# cuts down their salaries every #day# so that now they have scarcely any
no lest on the first demonstration i make in favor of mehemet $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ the sultan send me the bowstring and make my secretaries strangle me
#will# you be ambassador $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i #will# send you to constantinople you say very true responded $m_lucien_debray$
yes said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but this has #nothing# to do with the existence of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ $pardieu$
doubtless but not in the same #way# #everyone# has not black slaves a princely retinue an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an arabian fortress #horse# that cost six thousand #franc# apiece and greek mistresses
#everyone# exists have you seen the greek mistress i have both seen and heard her i saw her at the theatre and heard her #one# #morning# when i breakfasted with the #count#
he eats then yes but so little it can hardly be called eating he must be a vampire
laugh if you #will# the #countess# who knew $lord_ruthven$ declared that the #count# was a vampire ah capital said $m_beauchamp$
for a #man# not connected with newspapers here is the pendant to the famous #sea# serpent of the constitutionnel
wild #eye# the iris of which contracts or dilates at #pleasure# said $m_lucien_debray$ facial angle strongly developed magnificent #forehead# livid complexion black beard sharp and white teeth politeness unexceptionable
this #man# has often made me shudder and #one# #day# when we were viewing an execution i #thought# i should faint more from hearing the cold and calm #manner# in which he spoke of every description of torture than from the #sight# of the executioner and the culprit
just so $m_lucien_debray$ returned $m_albert_de_morcerf$ you have described him #feature# for #feature# yes keen and cutting politeness
did he not conduct you to the ruins of the colosseum and suck your #blood# asked $m_beauchamp$ or having delivered you make you #sign# a flaming parchment surrendering your soul to him as esau did his birth #right#
when i #look# at you parisians idlers on the boulevard de gand or the bois de boulogne and think of this #man# it seems to me we are not of the same race
rail on rail on at your ease #gentleman# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ somewhat piqued i am highly flattered returned $m_beauchamp$
at the same #time# added $baron_de_château_renaud$ your #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ is a very fine #fellow# always excepting his little arrangements with the italian banditti
there are no italian banditti said $m_lucien_debray$ no vampire cried $m_beauchamp$ no #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ added $m_lucien_debray$
there is #half# past ten striking $m_albert_de_morcerf$ confess you have dreamed this and let us sit down to breakfast continued $m_beauchamp$
but the #sound# of the clock had not died away when germain announced his #excellency# the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
the involuntary start #everyone# gave proved how much $m_albert_de_morcerf$ narrative had impressed them and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ himself could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden #emotion#
he had not heard a #carriage# stop in the #street# or #step# in the antechamber the #door# had itself opened noiselessly
the #count# appeared dressed with the greatest simplicity but the most fastidious dandy could have found #nothing# to cavil at in his toilet
every article of dress hat coat gloves and boots was from the first makers he seemed scarcely five and thirty but what struck everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait $m_lucien_debray$ had drawn
the #count# advanced smiling into the centre of the #room# and approached $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who hastened towards him holding out his #hand# in a ceremonial #manner#
punctuality said $m_de_monte_cristo$ is the politeness of #king# according to #one# of your sovereigns i think but it is not the same with #traveller#
however i #hope# you #will# excuse the two or three seconds i am behindhand five hundred leagues are not to be accomplished without some trouble and especially in france where it seems it is forbidden to beat the postilions
my dear #count# replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i was announcing your #visit# to some of my #friend# whom i had invited in consequence of the #promise# you did me the #honor# to make and whom i now present to you
they are the #count# of $baron_de_château_renaud$ whose nobility goes back to the twelve peers and whose ancestors had a #place# at the round #table# $m_lucien_debray$ private secretary to the #minister# of the interior $m_beauchamp$ an editor of a #paper# and the #terror# of the french government but of whom in #spite# of his national celebrity you perhaps have not heard in italy since his #paper# is prohibited there and $m_maximilian_morrel$ #captain# of spahis
at this #name# the #count# who had hitherto saluted #everyone# with courtesy but at the same #time# with coldness and formality stepped a pace forward and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks
you wear the uniform of the new french conquerors $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said he it is a handsome uniform
no #one# could have said what caused the #count# #voice# to vibrate so deeply and what made his #eye# flash which was in general so clear lustrous and limpid when he pleased
you have never seen our africans #count# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ never replied the #count# who was by this #time# perfectly #master# of himself again
well beneath this uniform beats #one# of the bravest and noblest #heart# in the whole army oh de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ interrupted $m_maximilian_morrel$
and we have just heard continued $m_albert_de_morcerf$ of a new deed of his and so heroic a #one# that although i have seen him #today# for the first #time# i request you to allow me to introduce him as my #friend#
at these #word# it was still possible to observe in $m_de_monte_cristo$ the concentrated #look# changing color and slight trembling of the eyelid that show #emotion#
let me go on #captain# ah you have a noble #heart# said the #count# so much the better
this exclamation which corresponded to the #count# own #thought# rather than to what $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was saying surprised everybody and especially $m_maximilian_morrel$ who looked at $m_de_monte_cristo$ with wonder
but at the same #time# the intonation was so soft that however strange the speech might seem it was impossible to be offended at it
in reality replied the latter who with his aristocratic #glance# and his knowledge of the #world# had penetrated at once all that was penetrable in $m_de_monte_cristo$
why should he #doubt# it said $m_beauchamp$ to $baron_de_château_renaud$ $m_albert_de_morcerf$ has not deceived us for the #count# is a most singular being
foi he has an open #look# about him that pleases me in #spite# of the singular remark he has made about me
what say you $m_maximilian_morrel$ ma #gentleman# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ germain informs me that breakfast is ready my dear #count# allow me to show you the #way#
#gentleman# said the #count# seating himself permit me to make a confession which must form my excuse for any improprieties i may commit
i am a #stranger# and a #stranger# to such a degree that this is the first #time# i have ever been at paris
the french #way# of living is utterly unknown to me and up to the present #time# i have followed the eastern customs which are entirely in contrast to the parisian
they passed silently into the breakfast #room# and #everyone# took his #place# i beg you therefore to excuse if you find #anything# in me too turkish too italian or too arabian
now then let us breakfast with what an #air# he says all this muttered $m_beauchamp$ decidedly he is a great #man#
a great #man# in his own #country# added $m_lucien_debray$ a great #man# in every #country# $m_lucien_debray$ said $baron_de_château_renaud$
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ remarked this expressing his #fear# lest at the outset the parisian mode of #life# should displease the #traveller# in the most essential #point#
i #fear# #one# #thing# and that is that the fare of the $rue_du_helder$ is not so much to your taste as that of the piazza di spagna
the #count# was it may be remembered a most temperate #guest# my dear #count# said he i ought to have consulted you on the #point# and have had some dishes prepared expressly
you would not give #one# #thought# of such a #thing# for a #traveller# like myself who has successively lived on macaroni at naples polenta at milan olla podrida at valencia pilau at constantinople curry in india and swallows nests in china
i eat everywhere and of #everything# only i eat but little and #today# that you reproach me with my want of appetite is my #day# of appetite for i have not eaten since #yesterday# #morning#
did you know me better returned the #count# smiling what cried all the #guest# you have not eaten for four and twenty #hour#
i was forced to go out of my #road# to obtain some information near nîmes so that i was somewhat late and therefore i did not choose to stop
no i slept as i generally do when i am weary without having the courage to amuse myself or when i am hungry without #feeling# inclined to eat
no replied the #count# and you ate in your #carriage# asked $m_albert_de_morcerf$
but you can sleep when you please $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said $m_maximilian_morrel$ yes you have a recipe for it
that would be invaluable to us in africa who have not always any food to eat and rarely #anything# to drink
but unfortunately a recipe excellent for a #man# like myself would be very dangerous applied to an army which might not awake when it was needed
an infallible #one# yes said $m_de_monte_cristo$ may we inquire what is this recipe asked $m_lucien_debray$
it is a mixture of excellent opium which i fetched myself from canton in #order# to have it pure and the best hashish which grows in the east that is between the tigris and the euphrates
oh yes returned $m_de_monte_cristo$ i make no #secret# of it these two ingredients are mixed in equal proportions and formed into pills
ten #minute# after #one# is taken the #effect# is produced ask #baron# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay i think he tasted them #one# #day#
yes replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he said #something# about it to me but said $m_beauchamp$ who as became a journalist was very incredulous you always carry this drug about you
always would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills continued $m_beauchamp$ hoping to take him at a disadvantage
no $monsieur_cavalcanti$ returned the #count# and he drew from his #pocket# a marvellous casket formed out of a single emerald and closed by a golden lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored pellet about the size of a pea
this ball had an acrid and penetrating odor there were four or five more in the emerald which would contain about a dozen
the casket passed around the #table# but it was more to examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from #hand# to #hand#
and is it your cook who prepares these pills asked $m_beauchamp$ oh no $monsieur_cavalcanti$ replied $m_de_monte_cristo$
i do not thus betray my enjoyments to the vulgar i am a tolerable chemist and prepare my pills myself
this is a magnificent emerald and the largest i have ever seen said $baron_de_château_renaud$ although my #mother# has some remarkable #family# jewels
i gave #one# to the sultan who mounted it in his sabre another to our holy #father# the pope who had it set in his tiara opposite to #one# nearly as large though not so fine given by the emperor $napoleon$ to his predecessor pius vii
i kept the third for myself and i had it hollowed out which reduced its value but rendered it more commodious for the #purpose# i intended
#everyone# looked at $m_de_monte_cristo$ with #astonishment# he spoke with so much simplicity that it was evident he spoke the #truth# or that he was mad
i had three similar #one# returned $m_de_monte_cristo$ however the #sight# of the emerald made them naturally incline to the former belief
the sultan the #liberty# of a #woman# replied the #count# the pope the #life# of a #man# so that once in my #life# i have been as powerful as if heaven had brought me into the #world# on the #step# of a throne
and what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these magnificent presents asked $m_lucien_debray$ and it was $peppino$ you saved was it not
cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$ it was for him that you obtained pardon perhaps returned the #count# smiling my dear #count# you have no #idea# what #pleasure# it gives me to hear you speak thus said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
i had announced you beforehand to my #friend# as an enchanter of the arabian #night# a wizard of the middle #age# but the parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they mistake for caprices of the imagination the most incontestable #truth# when these #truth# do not form a #part# of their daily existence
a member of the jockey club has been stopped and robbed on the boulevard four #person# have been assassinated in the rue st denis or the faubourg st germain ten fifteen or twenty thieves have been arrested in a café on the boulevard du temple or in the thermes de julien and yet these same #man# deny the existence of the #bandit# in the maremma the campagna di romana or the pontine marshes
tell them yourself that i was taken by #bandit# and that without your generous intercession i should now have been sleeping in the catacombs of st sebastian instead of receiving them in my humble abode in the $rue_du_helder$
for example here is $m_lucien_debray$ who reads and $m_beauchamp$ who prints every #day# ah said $m_de_monte_cristo$
you promised me never to mention that #circumstance# it was not i who made that #promise# cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$
pray speak of it for i shall not only i trust relate the little i do know but also a great deal i do not know
it must have been someone else whom you have rescued in the same #manner# and whom you have forgotten
it seems to me returned the #count# smiling that you played a sufficiently important #part# to know as well as myself what happened
well you #promise# me if i tell all i know to relate in your #turn# all that i do not know
well said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ for three #day# i believed myself the object of the #attention# of a masque whom i took for a descendant of tullia or poppæa while i was simply the object of the #attention# of a contadina and i say contadina to avoid saying peasant #girl#
what i know is that like a fool a greater fool than he of whom i spoke just now i mistook for this peasant #girl# a young #bandit# of fifteen or sixteen with a beardless chin and slim waist and who just as i was about to imprint a chaste salute on his #lip# placed a #pistol# to my #head# and aided by seven or eight #other# led or rather dragged me to the catacombs of st sebastian where i found a highly educated brigand chief perusing $cæsar_borgia$ commentaries and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me that unless the next #morning# before six clock four thousand piastres were paid into his #account# at his #banker# at a #quarter#
the #letter# is still to be seen for it is in $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay #possession# signed by me and with a postscript of $luigi_vampa$
this is all i know but i know not #count# how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the #bandit# of rome who ordinarily have so little respect for #anything#
that is but fair replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ past six i should have ceased to exist i assure you $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and i were lost in admiration
when he was quite a #child# and only a shepherd i gave him a few #gold# #piece# for showing me my #way# and he in #order# to repay me gave me a poniard the hilt of which he had carved with his own #hand# and which you may have seen in my collection of #arm#
in after #year# whether he had forgotten this interchange of presents which ought to have cemented our friendship or whether he did not recollect me he sought to take me but on the #contrary# it was i who captured him and a dozen of his band
i might have handed him over to roman #justice# which is somewhat expeditious and which would have been particularly so with him but i did #nothing# of the #sort#
#nothing# more simple returned the #count# i had known the famous $luigi_vampa$ for more than ten #year#
i suffered him and his band to depart with the condition that they should sin no more said $m_beauchamp$ laughing
i see they kept their #promise# no $monsieur_cavalcanti$ returned $m_de_monte_cristo$ upon the simple condition that they should respect myself and my #friend#
perhaps what i am about to say may seem strange to you who are socialists and vaunt humanity and your #duty# to your neighbor but i never seek to protect a society which does not protect me and which i #will# even say generally occupies itself about me only to injure me and thus by giving them a low #place# in my esteem and preserving a neutrality towards them it is society and my neighbor who are indebted to me
bravo cried $baron_de_château_renaud$ you are the first #man# i ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism bravo #count# bravo
but i am sure that the #count# does not regret having once deviated from the principles he has so boldly avowed
asked $m_de_monte_cristo$ who could not help looking at $m_maximilian_morrel$ with so much intensity that two or three #time# the young #man# had been unable to sustain that clear and piercing #glance#
why it seems to me replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ that in delivering de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ whom you did not know you did good to your neighbor and to society
it is frank at least said $m_maximilian_morrel$ how have i deviated from those principles $monsieur_cavalcanti$
of which he is the brightest ornament said $m_beauchamp$ drinking off a #glass# of champagne my dear #count# cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$
you are at fault you #one# of the most formidable logicians i know and you must see it clearly proved that instead of being an egotist you are a philanthropist
ah you call yourself oriental a levantine maltese indian chinese your #family# #name# is $m_de_monte_cristo$ sinbad the #sailor# is your baptismal appellation and yet the first #day# you set #foot# in paris you instinctively display the greatest virtue or rather the chief defect of us eccentric
parisians that is you assume the vices you have not and conceal the virtues you possess my dear vicomte returned $m_de_monte_cristo$
i do not see in all i have done #anything# that merits either from you or these #gentleman# the pretended eulogies i have received
you were no #stranger# to me for i knew you from the #time# i gave up two #room# to you invited you to breakfast with me lent you #one# of my #carriage# witnessed the carnival in your company and saw with you from a #window# in the piazza del popolo the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted
i #will# appeal to any of these #gentleman# could i leave my #guest# in the #hand# of a hideous #bandit# as you term him
besides you know i had the #idea# that you could introduce me into some of the paris salons when i came to france
you might some #time# ago have looked upon this resolution as a vague project but #today# you see it was a reality and you must submit to it under penalty of breaking your #word#
i #will# keep it returned $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but i #fear# that you #will# be much disappointed accustomed as you are to picturesque #event# and fantastic horizons
amongst us you #will# not meet with any of those episodes with which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you our chimborazo is mortmartre our himalaya is mount valérien
we have plenty of thieves though not so many as is said but these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than a lord
our great desert is the plain of grenelle where they are now boring an artesian well to #water# the caravans france is so prosaic and paris so civilized a city that you #will# not find in its eighty five departments
you #will# not find then in these eighty five departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph or a grotto in which the commissary of #police# has not put up a gaslamp
there is but #one# #service# i can render you and for that i #place# myself entirely at your #order# that is to present or make my #friend# present
i say eighty five because i do not include corsica you everywhere besides you have no need of #anyone# to introduce you
with your #name# and your #fortune# and your talent $m_de_monte_cristo$ bowed with a somewhat ironical #smile# you can present yourself everywhere and be well received
i can be useful in #one# #way# only if knowledge of parisian habits of the #mean# of rendering yourself comfortable or of the bazaars can assist you may depend upon me to find you a fitting dwelling here
i who do not profess egotism but am yet egotist par excellence for except myself these #room# would not hold a #shadow# more unless that #shadow# were feminine
ah said the #count# that is a most conjugal reservation i recollect that at rome you said #something# of a projected #marriage#
i do not dare offer to share my #apartment# with you as i shared yours at rome may i congratulate you
the #affair# is still in projection and he who says in projection #mean# already decided said $m_lucien_debray$
no replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ my #father# is most anxious about it and i #hope# ere long to introduce you if not to my #wife# at least to my betrothed $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said $m_de_monte_cristo$ tell me is not her #father# #baron# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ yes returned $m_albert_de_morcerf$ a #baron# of a new creation
what #matter# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ if he has rendered the state #service# which merit this distinction
although in reality a liberal he negotiated a loan of six #million# for charles in who made him a #baron# and chevalier of the legion of #honor# so that he wears the ribbon not as you would think in his waistcoat #pocket# but at his button hole
ah interrupted $m_albert_de_morcerf$ laughing $m_beauchamp$ beauchamp keep that for the corsaire or the charivari but spare my future #father# in #law# before me
enormous #one# answered $m_beauchamp$ then turning to $m_de_monte_cristo$ you just now spoke his #name# as if you knew the #baron#
but i shall probably soon make his acquaintance for i have a credit opened with him by the $house_of_peers$ of richard blount of london arstein eskeles of vienna and $thomson_french_of_rome$ at rome
i do not know him returned $m_de_monte_cristo$ as he pronounced the two last #name# the #count# glanced at $m_maximilian_morrel$
if the #stranger# expected to produce an #effect# on $m_maximilian_morrel$ he was not mistaken $m_maximilian_morrel$ started as if he had been electrified
$thomson_french_of_rome$ said he do you know this $house_of_peers$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ they are my #banker# in the capital of the christian #world# returned the #count# quietly
can my influence with them be of any #service# to you oh #count# you could assist me perhaps in researches which have been up to the present fruitless
this $house_of_peers$ in past #year# did ours a great #service# and has i know not for what #reason# always denied having rendered us this #service#
i shall be at your #order# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ bowing but continued $m_albert_de_morcerf$ propos of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ we have strangely wandered from the #subject#
we were speaking of a suitable habitation for the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ come #gentleman# let us all propose some #place#
where shall we lodge this new #guest# in our great capital faubourg saint germain said $baron_de_château_renaud$ the #count# #will# find there a charming hotel with a #court# and #garden#
you only know your dull and gloomy faubourg saint germain do not pay any #attention# to him #count# live in the chaussée antin that the real centre of paris
bah $baron_de_château_renaud$ returned $m_lucien_debray$ boulevard de opéra said $m_beauchamp$ the second #floor# a $house_of_peers$ with a balcony
the #count# #will# have his cushions of silver cloth brought there and as he smokes his chibouque see all paris pass before him
you have no #idea# then $m_maximilian_morrel$ asked $baron_de_château_renaud$ you do not propose #anything# oh yes returned the young #man# smiling
on the #contrary# i have #one# but i expected the #count# would be tempted by #one# of the brilliant proposals made him yet as he has not replied to any of them i #will# venture to offer him a suite of #apartment# in a charming hotel in the pompadour style that my sister has inhabited for a #year# in the rue meslay
you have a sister asked the #count# yes $monsieur_cavalcanti$ a most excellent sister married
nearly nine #year# happy asked the #count# again as happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be replied $m_maximilian_morrel$
she married the #man# she loved who remained faithful to us in our fallen #fortune# $m_emmanuel$ herbaut $m_de_monte_cristo$ smiled imperceptibly
and i shall be together with my #brother# in #law# $m_emmanuel$ at the disposition of the #count# whenever he thinks fit to #honor# us
i live there during my leave of absence continued $m_maximilian_morrel$ #one# #minute# cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$ without giving $m_de_monte_cristo$ the #time# to reply
take #care# you are going to immure a #traveller# sinbad the #sailor# a #man# who comes to see paris you are going to make a patriarch of him
oh no said $m_maximilian_morrel$ my sister is five and twenty my #brother# in #law# is thirty they are gay young and happy
besides the #count# #will# be in his own $house_of_peers$ and only see them when he thinks fit to do so
i shall content myself with being presented to your sister and her #husband# if you #will# do me the #honor# to introduce me but i cannot accept the offer of #anyone# of these #gentleman# since my habitation is already prepared
#thank# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said $m_de_monte_cristo$ what cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$ you are then going to a hotel that #will# be very dull for you
at rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in furnishing your #apartment# but i presume that you are not disposed to spend a similar #sum# every #day#
was i so badly lodged at rome said $m_de_monte_cristo$ smiling parbleu it is not that which deterred me replied $m_de_monte_cristo$
but as i determined to have a $house_of_peers$ to myself i sent on my #valet# de chambre and he ought by this #time# to have bought the $house_of_peers$ and furnished it
but you have then a #valet# de chambre who knows paris said $m_beauchamp$ it is the first #time# he has ever been in paris
he is black and cannot speak returned $m_de_monte_cristo$ it is $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in the midst of the general surprise
yes $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ himself my nubian mute whom you saw i think at rome certainly said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i recollect him perfectly
but how could you charge a nubian to purchase a $house_of_peers$ and a mute to furnish it he #will# do #everything# wrong
undeceive yourself $monsieur_cavalcanti$ replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ i am quite sure that on the #contrary# he #will# choose #everything# as i #wish#
he knows my tastes my caprices my wants he has been here a week with the instinct of a hound hunting by himself
he knew that i should arrive #today# at ten clock he was waiting for me at nine at the barrière de fontainebleau
he gave me this #paper# it contains the number of my new abode read it yourself and $m_de_monte_cristo$ passed a #paper# to $m_albert_de_morcerf$
he #will# arrange #everything# for me ah that is really original said $m_beauchamp$ and very princely added $baron_de_château_renaud$
i told you i did not #wish# to be behind my #time# i dressed myself in the #carriage# and descended at the viscount
the young #man# looked at each #other# they did not know if it was a comedy $m_de_monte_cristo$ was playing but every #word# he uttered had such an #air# of simplicity that it was impossible to suppose what he said was false
what do you not know your $house_of_peers$ asked $m_lucien_debray$ no said $m_de_monte_cristo$ #door# besides why should he tell a falsehood
we must content ourselves then said $m_beauchamp$ with rendering the #count# all the little #service# in our #power# i in my quality of journalist open all the theatres to him
#thank# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ returned $m_de_monte_cristo$ my steward has #order# to take a #box# at each theatre
is your steward also a nubian asked $m_lucien_debray$ no he is a countryman of yours if a corsican is a countryman of #anyone#
but you know him de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ is it that excellent $m_bertuccio$ who understands hiring #window# so well
yes you saw him the #day# i had the #honor# of receiving you he has been a #soldier# a smuggler in #fact# #everything#
i would not be quite sure that he has not been mixed up with the #police# for some trifle a stab with a knife for instance
and you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward said $m_lucien_debray$ of how much does he rob you every #year#
on my #word# replied the #count# not more than another i am sure he #answer# my #purpose# knows no impossibility and so i keep him
then continued $baron_de_château_renaud$ since you have an establishment a steward and a hotel in the champs élysées you only want a mistress
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ smiled he #thought# of the fair greek he had seen in the #count# #box# at the argentina and valle theatres
you procure your mistresses from the opera the vaudeville or the variétés i purchased mine at constantinople it cost me more but i have #nothing# to #fear#
but you forget replied $m_lucien_debray$ laughing that we are franks by #name# and franks by #nature# as #king# charles said and that the #moment# she puts her #foot# in france your slave becomes free
i have #something# better than that said $m_de_monte_cristo$ i have a slave who #will# tell her
the first #person# who sees her she only speaks romaic that is different but at least we shall see her said $m_beauchamp$
or do you keep eunuchs as well as mutes oh no replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ i do not carry brutalism so far
#everyone# who surrounds me is free to quit me and when they leave me #will# no longer have any need of me or #anyone# else
it is for that #reason# perhaps that they do not quit me they had long since passed to dessert and cigars
my dear $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said $m_lucien_debray$ rising it is #half# past two your #guest# is charming but you leave the best company to go into the worst sometimes
i must #return# to the #minister# i #will# tell him of the #count# and we shall soon know who he is
oh we have three #million# for our #police# it is true they are almost always spent beforehand but no #matter# we shall still have fifty thousand #franc# to spend for this #purpose#
take #care# returned $m_albert_de_morcerf$ no #one# has been able to accomplish that and when you know #will# you tell me
i #promise# you au revoir $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #gentleman# good #morning# as he left the #room# $m_lucien_debray$ called out loudly
i shall not go to the #chamber# but i have #something# better to offer my readers than a speech of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
my #carriage# bravo said $m_beauchamp$ to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ for heaven sake $m_beauchamp$ returned $m_albert_de_morcerf$ do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him everywhere
is he not peculiar he is more than that replied $baron_de_château_renaud$ he is #one# of the most extraordinary #man# i ever saw in my #life#
directly i have given my card to the #count# who has promised to pay us a #visit# at rue meslay no
are you coming $m_maximilian_morrel$ be sure i shall not fail to do so returned the #count# bowing and $m_maximilian_morrel$ left the #room# with the $baron_de_château_renaud$ leaving $m_de_monte_cristo$ alone with $m_albert_de_morcerf$
my dear #count# said he allow me to commence my #service# as cicerone by showing you a specimen of a bachelor #apartment#
you who are accustomed to the palaces of italy can amuse yourself by calculating in how many square #foot# a young #man# who is not the worst lodged in paris can live
#chapter# the presentation when $m_albert_de_morcerf$ found himself alone with $m_de_monte_cristo$ as we pass from #one# #room# to another i #will# open the #window# to let you breathe
$m_de_monte_cristo$ had already seen the breakfast #room# and the salon on the #ground# #floor# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ led him first to his atelier which was as we have said his favorite #apartment#
old cabinets japanese porcelain oriental stuffs venetian #glass# #arm# from all #part# of the #world# #everything# was familiar to him and at the first #glance# he recognized their date their #country# and their origin
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ had expected he should be the guide on the #contrary# it was he who under the #count# guidance followed a #course# of archæology mineralogy and natural history
$m_de_monte_cristo$ quickly appreciated all that $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had collected here they descended to the first #floor# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ led his #guest# into the salon
the salon was filled with the #work# of modern artists there were landscapes by dupré with their long reeds and tall #tree# their lowing oxen and marvellous skies delacroix arabian cavaliers with their long white burnouses their shining belts their damasked #arm# their #horse# who tore each #other# with their teeth while their riders contended fiercely with their maces aquarelles of boulanger representing notre dame de paris with that vigor that makes the artist the rival of the poet there were paintings by diaz who makes his flowers more beautiful than flowers his suns more brilliant than the sun designs by decamp as vividly colored as those of salvator rosa but more poetic pastels by giraud and müller representing #child# like angels and #woman# with the #feature# of a virgin sketches torn from the album of dauzats travels in the east that had been made in a few seconds on the saddle of a camel or beneath the dome of a mosque in a #word# all that modern art can give in exchange and as recompense for the art lost and gone with #age# long since past
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ expected to have #something# new this #time# to show to the #traveller# but to his great surprise the latter without seeking for the signatures many of which indeed were only initials named instantly the author of every picture in such a #manner# that it was easy to see that each #name# was not only known to him but that each style associated with it had been appreciated and studied by him
from the salon they passed into the bedchamber it was a model of taste and simple elegance a single portrait signed by léopold robert shone in its carved and gilded frame
this portrait attracted the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ #attention# for he made three rapid #step# in the #chamber# and stopped suddenly before it
it was the portrait of a young #woman# of five or six and twenty with a dark complexion and #light# and lustrous #eye# veiled beneath long lashes
she wore the picturesque #costume# of the catalan fisherwomen a red and black bodice and golden pins in her #hair# she was looking at the #sea# and her form was outlined on the blue ocean and sky
the #light# was so faint in the #room# that $m_albert_de_morcerf$ did not perceive the pallor that spread itself over the #count# visage or the nervous heaving of his chest and #shoulder#
you have there a most charming mistress viscount said the #count# in a perfectly calm #tone# and this #costume# a ball #costume# doubtless becomes her admirably
#silence# prevailed for an #instant# during which $m_de_monte_cristo$ gazed intently on the picture ah $monsieur_cavalcanti$ returned $m_albert_de_morcerf$
i would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this you do not know my #mother# she it is whom you see here
this #costume# is a fancy #one# it appears and the resemblance is so great that i think i still see my #mother# the same as she was in
she had her portrait painted thus six or eight #year# ago the #countess# had this portrait painted during the #count# absence
she doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise but strange to say this portrait seemed to displease my #father# and the value of the picture which is as you see #one# of the best #work# of léopold robert could not overcome his dislike to it
it is true between ourselves that de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ is #one# of the most assiduous peers at the luxembourg a general renowned for theory but a most mediocre amateur of art
it is different with my #mother# who paints exceedingly well and who unwilling to #part# with so valuable a picture gave it to me to put here where it would be less likely to displease de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ whose portrait by gros i #will# also show you
excuse my talking of #family# #matter# but as i shall have the #honor# of introducing you to the #count# i tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture
the picture seems to have a malign influence for my #mother# rarely comes here without looking at it and still more rarely does she #look# at it without weeping
this disagreement is the only #one# that has ever taken #place# between the #count# and #countess# who are still as much united although married more than twenty #year# as on the first #day# of their wedding
$m_de_monte_cristo$ glanced rapidly at $m_albert_de_morcerf$ as if to seek a hidden meaning in his #word# but it was evident the young #man# uttered them in the simplicity of his #heart#
now said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ that you have seen all my #treasure# allow me to offer them to you unworthy as they are
consider yourself as in your own $house_of_peers$ and to put yourself still more at your ease pray accompany me to the #apartment# of de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he whom i wrote from rome an #account# of the #service# you rendered me and to whom i announced your promised #visit# and i may say that both the #count# and #countess# anxiously #desire# to #thank# you in #person#
you are somewhat blasé i know and #family# #scene# have not much #effect# on sinbad the #sailor# who has seen so many #other#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ bowed without making any #answer# he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret as #one# of those conventions of society which every #gentleman# #look# upon as a #duty#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ summoned his #servant# and ordered him to acquaint and #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ of the arrival of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
however accept what i propose to you as an initiation into parisian #life# a #life# of politeness visiting and introductions $m_albert_de_morcerf$ followed him with the #count#
when they arrived at the antechamber above the #door# was visible a shield which by its rich ornaments and its harmony with the #rest# of the furniture indicated the importance the owner attached to this blazon
$m_de_monte_cristo$ stopped and examined it attentively azure seven merlets or placed bender said he these are doubtless your #family# #arm#
i a #count# of a fresh creation fabricated in tuscany by the aid of a commandery of st stephen and who would not have taken the trouble had i not been told that when you travel much it is necessary
except the knowledge of blazons that enables me to decipher them i am very ignorant of heraldry besides you must have #something# on the panels of your #carriage# to escape being searched by the custom $house_of_peers$ #officer#
excuse my putting such a #question# to you it is not indiscreet returned $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with the simplicity of conviction
these are our #arm# that is those of my #father# but they are as you see joined to another shield which has gules a silver tower which are my #mother#
by her #side# i am spanish but the #family# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ is french and i have heard #one# of the oldest of the south of france
almost all the armed pilgrims that went to the holy land took for their #arm# either a cross in #honor# of their mission or birds of passage in #sign# of the long voyage they were about to undertake and which they hoped to accomplish on the wings of faith
#one# of your ancestors had joined the crusades and supposing it to be only that of st $louis_xviii$ that makes you mount to the thirteenth century which is tolerably ancient
it is possible said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ my #father# has in his #study# a genealogical #tree# which #will# tell you all that and on which i made commentaries that would have greatly edified hozier and jaucourt
at present i no longer think of it and yet i must tell you that we are beginning to occupy ourselves greatly with these #thing# under our popular government
well then your government would do well to choose from the past #something# better than the #thing# that i have noticed on your monuments and which have no heraldic meaning whatever
you have guessed rightly yes replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ these blazons prove that as for you viscount continued $m_de_monte_cristo$ to $m_albert_de_morcerf$
yes you are at once from provence and spain that explains if the portrait you showed me be like the dark hue i so much admired on the visage of the noble catalan
it would have required the penetration of œdipus or the sphinx to have divined the irony the #count# concealed beneath these #word# apparently uttered with the greatest politeness
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ thanked him with a #smile# and pushed open the #door# above which were his #arm# and which as we have said opened into the salon
you are more fortunate than the government for your #arm# are really beautiful and speak to the imagination in the most conspicuous #part# of the salon was another portrait
it was that of a #man# from five to eight and thirty in the uniform of a general #officer# wearing the double epaulet of heavy bullion that indicates superior rank the ribbon of the legion of #honor# around his neck which showed he was a commander and on the #right# breast the star of a grand #officer# of the #order# of the saviour and on the left that of the grand cross of charles iii which proved that the #person# represented by the picture had served in the wars of greece and spain or what was just the same #thing# as regarded decorations had fulfilled some diplomatic mission in the two #country#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ was engaged in examining this portrait with no less #care# than he had bestowed upon the #other# when another #door# opened and he found himself opposite to the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in #person#
he was a #man# of forty to forty five #year# but he seemed at least fifty and his black moustache and eyebrows contrasted strangely with his almost white #hair# which was cut short in the military fashion
he was dressed in plain clothes and wore at his button hole the ribbons of the different #order# to which he belonged
he entered with a tolerably dignified #step# and some little haste $m_de_monte_cristo$ saw him advance towards him without making a single #step#
it seemed as if his #foot# were rooted to the #ground# and his #eye# on the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #father# said the young #man#
i have the #honor# of presenting to you the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ the generous #friend# whom i had the good #fortune# to meet in the critical situation of which i have told you
you are most welcome $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ saluting $m_de_monte_cristo$ with a #smile# and $monsieur_cavalcanti$ has rendered our $house_of_peers$ in preserving its only heir a #service# which insures him our eternal gratitude
as he said these #word# the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ pointed to a #chair# while he seated himself in another opposite the #window#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ in taking the #seat# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ offered him placed himself in such a #manner# as to remain concealed in the #shadow# of the large velvet curtains and read on the careworn and livid #feature# of the #count# a whole history of #secret# #grief# written in each wrinkle #time# had planted there
the #countess# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was at her toilet when she was informed of the #visit# she was about to receive
it is a great #honor# to me returned $m_de_monte_cristo$ to be thus on the first #day# of my arrival in paris brought in contact with a #man# whose merit equals his reputation and to whom #fortune# has for once been equitable but has she not still on the plains of mitidja or in the mountains of atlas a marshal staff to offer you
she #will# however be in the salon in ten #minute# oh replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ reddening slightly i have left the #service# $monsieur_cavalcanti$
i could therefore expect a higher rank and who knows what might have happened had the elder branch remained on the throne
but the revolution of july was it seems sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful and it was so for all #service# that did not date from the imperial period
i tendered my resignation for when you have gained your epaulets on the battle field you do not know how to manœuvre on the slippery #ground# of the salons
made a peer at the restoration i served through the first campaign under the #order# of marshal bourmont i have hung up my sword and cast myself into politics
i have devoted myself to industry i #study# the useful arts during the twenty #year# i served i often wished to do so but i had not the #time#
a #gentleman# of high birth possessor of an ample #fortune# you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure #soldier# #step# by #step#
this is uncommon then become general peer of france commander of the legion of #honor# you consent to again commence a second apprenticeship without any #other# #hope# or any #other# #desire# than that of #one# #day# becoming useful to your #fellow# creatures this indeed is praiseworthy nay more it is sublime
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ looked on and listened with #astonishment# he was not used to see $m_de_monte_cristo$ give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm
these are the #idea# that render your nation superior to any #other# returned $m_de_monte_cristo$ alas continued the #stranger# doubtless to dispel the slight cloud that covered $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #brow#
we do not act thus in italy we grow according to our race and our species and we pursue the same #line# and often the same uselessness all our #life#
but $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ for a #man# of your merit italy is not a #country# and france opens her #arm# to receive you respond to her call
france #will# not perhaps be always ungrateful she treats her #child# ill but she always welcomes #stranger#
it is evident you do not know the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ he despises all #honor# and contents himself with those written on his passport
ah #father# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with a #smile# that is the most just remark replied the #stranger#
i ever heard made concerning myself you have been free to choose your career observed the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with a sigh
and you have chosen the path strewed with flowers precisely $monsieur_cavalcanti$ replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ with #one# of those #smile# that a painter could never represent or a physiologist analyze
if i did not #fear# to fatigue you said the general evidently charmed with the #count# #manner# i would have taken you to the #chamber# there is a debate very curious to those who are #stranger# to our modern senators
i shall be most grateful $monsieur_cavalcanti$ if you #will# at some future #time# renew your offer but i have been flattered with the #hope# of being introduced to the #countess# and i #will# therefore wait
$m_de_monte_cristo$ turned round hastily and saw #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ at the entrance of the salon at the #door# opposite to that by which her #husband# had entered pale and motionless when $m_de_monte_cristo$ turned round she let fall her #arm# which for some unknown #reason# had been resting on the gilded #door# post
ah here is my #mother# cried the viscount she had been there some #moment# and had heard the last #word# of the visitor
the latter rose and bowed to the #countess# who inclined herself without speaking ah good heavens #madame# said the #count# are you ill or is it the heat of the #room# that affects you
are you ill #mother# cried the viscount springing towards her she thanked them both with a #smile# no returned she
but i feel some #emotion# on seeing for the first #time# the #man# without whose intervention we should have been in #tear# and desolation
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ continued the #countess# advancing with the majesty of a queen i owe to you the #life# of my #son# and for this i bless you
now i #thank# you for the #pleasure# you give me in thus affording me the opportunity of thanking you as i have blessed you from the bottom of my #heart#
the #count# bowed again but lower than before he was even paler than $mercédès$ #madame# said he the #count# and yourself recompense too generously a simple action
to save a #man# to spare a #father# #feeling# or a #mother# sensibility is not to do a good action but a simple deed of humanity
it is very fortunate for my #son# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ that he found such a #friend# and i #thank# god that #thing# are thus
and $mercédès$ raised her fine #eye# to heaven with so fervent an #expression# of gratitude that the #count# fancied he saw #tear# in them
at these #word# uttered with the most exquisite sweetness and politeness #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ replied de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ approached her
#madame# said he i have already made my excuses to the #count# for quitting him and i pray you to do so also
go then and $monsieur_cavalcanti$ and i #will# strive our best to forget your absence replied the #countess# with the same #tone# of deep #feeling#
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ continued she turning to $m_de_monte_cristo$ #will# you do us the #honor# of passing the #rest# of the #day# with us
believe me #madame# i feel most grateful for your kindness but i got out of my travelling #carriage# at your #door# this #morning# and i am ignorant how i am installed in paris which i scarcely know this is but a trifling inquietude i know but #one# that may be appreciated
the sitting commences at two it is now three and i am to speak we shall have the #pleasure# another #time# said the #countess# you #promise# that
$m_de_monte_cristo$ inclined himself without answering but the gesture might pass for assent i #will# not detain you $monsieur_cavalcanti$ continued the #countess#
my dear #count# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i #will# endeavor to #return# your politeness at rome and #place# my coupé at your disposal until your own be ready
i would not have our gratitude become indiscreet or importunate a thousand #thank# for your kindness viscount returned the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
but i suppose that $m_bertuccio$ has suitably employed the four #hour# and a #half# i have given him and that i shall find a #carriage# of some #sort# ready at the #door#
he knew that like nero he was in search of the impossible and #nothing# astonished him but wishing to judge with his own #eye# how far
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ was used to the #count# #manner# of proceeding the #count# #order# had been executed he accompanied him to the #door# of the $house_of_peers$
as soon as he appeared in the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ antechamber a footman the same who at rome had brought the #count# card to the two young #man# and announced his #visit# sprang into the vestibule and when he arrived at the #door# the illustrious #traveller# found his #carriage# awaiting him
it was a coupé of koller building and with #horse# and harness for which drake had to the knowledge of all the lions of paris refused on the previous #day# seven hundred guineas
i do not ask you to accompany me to my $house_of_peers$ as i can only show you a habitation fitted up in a hurry and i have as you know a reputation to keep up as regards not being taken by surprise
give me therefore #one# more #day# before i invite you i shall then be certain not to fail in my hospitality
if you ask me for a #day# #count# i know what to anticipate it #will# not be a $house_of_peers$ i shall see but a palace
$m_de_monte_cristo$ was not deceived $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said the #count# to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ you have decidedly some genius at your control
ma foi spread that #idea# replied the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ putting his #foot# on the velvet lined #step# of his splendid #carriage# and that #will# be worth #something# to me among the #lady#
as he spoke he sprang into the vehicle the #door# was closed but not so rapidly that $m_de_monte_cristo$ failed to perceive the almost imperceptible movement which stirred the curtains of the #apartment# in which he had left #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$
when $m_albert_de_morcerf$ returned to his #mother# he found her in the boudoir reclining in a large velvet armchair the whole #room# so obscure that only the shining spangle fastened here and there to the drapery and the angles of the gilded frames of the pictures showed with some degree of brightness in the gloom
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ could not see the #face# of the #countess# as it was covered with a thin veil she had put on her #head# and which fell over her #feature# in misty folds but it seemed to him as though her #voice# had altered
he could distinguish amid the perfumes of the roses and heliotropes in the flower stands the sharp and fragrant odor of volatile salts and he noticed in #one# of the chased cups on the mantle #piece# the #countess# smelling bottle taken from its shagreen #case# and exclaimed in a #tone# of uneasiness as he entered
no no $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but you know these roses tuberoses and orange flowers throw out at first before #one# is used to them such violent perfumes
my dear #mother# have you been ill during my absence then my dear #mother# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ putting his #hand# to the bell
they must be taken into the antechamber you are really ill and just now were so pale as you came into the #room#
was i pale $m_albert_de_morcerf$ yes a pallor that suits you admirably #mother# but which did not the less alarm my #father# and myself
did your #father# speak of it inquired $mercédès$ eagerly no #madame# but do you not remember that he spoke of the #fact# to you
yes i do remember replied the #countess# a #servant# entered summoned by $m_albert_de_morcerf$ ring of the bell take these flowers into the anteroom or dressing #room# said the viscount they make the #countess# ill
the footman obeyed his #order# a long pause ensued which lasted until all the flowers were removed what is this #name# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
inquired the #countess# when the #servant# had taken away the last vase of flowers is it a #family# #name# or the #name# of the estate or a simple title
i believe #mother# it is merely a title the #count# purchased an #island# in the tuscan archipelago and as he told you #today# has founded a commandery
you know the same #thing# was done for saint stephen of florence saint george constantinian of parma and even for the #order# of malta
except this he has no pretension to nobility and calls himself a #chance# #count# although the general #opinion# at rome is that the #count# is a #man# of very high distinction
his #manner# are admirable said the #countess# at least as far as i could judge in the few #minute# he remained here
they are perfect #mother# so perfect that they surpass by far all i have known in the leading aristocracy of the three proudest nobilities of europe
the english the spanish and the german the #countess# paused a #moment# then after a slight hesitation she resumed
you have seen de $m_de_monte_cristo$ in his $house_of_peers$ you are quicksighted have much knowledge of the #world# more tact than is usual at your #age# do you think the #count# is really what he appears to be
you have seen my dear $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i ask the #question# as a #mother# what does he appear to be
why you have just said a #man# of high distinction i told you my dear #mother# he was esteemed such
i must tell you that i have not come to any decided #opinion# respecting him but i think him a maltese
but what is your own #opinion# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i do not ask you of his origin but what he is
i have seen so many remarkable #thing# in him that if you would have me really say what i think i shall reply that i really do #look# upon him as #one# of byron heroes whom misery has marked with a fatal brand some manfred some lara some werner #one# of those wrecks as it were of some ancient #family# who disinherited of their patrimony have achieved #one# by the force of their adventurous genius which has placed them above the #law# of society
i say that $m_de_monte_cristo$ is an #island# in the midst of the mediterranean without inhabitants or garrison the resort of smugglers of all nations and pirates of every flag
ah what he is that is quite another #thing# you say who knows whether or not these industrious worthies do not pay to their feudal lord some dues for his protection
that is possible said the #countess# reflecting never #mind# continued the young #man# smuggler or not you must agree
#mother# dear as you have seen him that the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ is a remarkable #man# who #will# have the greatest success in the salons of paris
why this very #morning# in my #room# he made his entrée amongst us by striking every #man# of us with amazement not even excepting $baron_de_château_renaud$
and what do you suppose is the #count# #age# inquired $mercédès$ evidently attaching great importance to this #question#
so young it is impossible said $mercédès$ replying at the same #time# to what $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said as well as to her own private reflection
thirty five or thirty six #mother# it is the #truth# however three or four #time# he has said to me and certainly without the slightest premeditation
at such a period i was five #year# old at another ten #year# old at another twelve and i induced by curiosity which kept me alive to these details have compared the dates and never found him inaccurate
besides #mother# remark how vivid his #eye# how raven black his #hair# and his #brow# though so pale is free from wrinkles he is not only vigorous but also young
the #age# of this singular #man# who is of no #age# is then i am certain thirty five the #countess# bent her #head# as if beneath a heavy wave of bitter #thought#
and has this #man# displayed a friendship for you $m_albert_de_morcerf$ she asked with a nervous shudder i am inclined to think so
why he pleases me in #spite# of $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay who tries to convince me that he is a being returned from the #other# #world#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ she said in a #voice# which was altered by #emotion# i have always put you on your guard against new acquaintances
and do you like him the #countess# shuddered now you are a #man# and are able to give me advice yet i repeat to you $m_albert_de_morcerf$ be prudent
why my dear #mother# it is necessary in #order# to make your advice #turn# to #account# that i should know beforehand what i have to distrust
the #count# never plays he only drinks pure #water# tinged with a little sherry and is so rich that he cannot without intending to laugh at me try to borrow #money#
what then have i to #fear# from him you are #right# said the #countess# and my #fear# are weakness especially when directed against a #man# who has saved your #life#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ is sometimes occupied his #business# makes him reflective and he might without intending it #nothing# could be in better taste than my #father# demeanor #madame# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
nay more he seemed greatly flattered at two or three compliments which the #count# very skilfully and agreeably paid him with as much ease as if he had known him these thirty #year#
how did your #father# receive him $m_albert_de_morcerf$ it is necessary that we should be more than complaisant to the #count# each of these little tickling arrows must have pleased my #father# added $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with a laugh
and thus they parted the best possible #friend# and de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ even wished to take him to the #chamber# to hear the speakers
the young #man# standing up before her gazed upon her with that filial affection which is so tender and endearing with #child# whose #mother# are still young and handsome
then after seeing her #eye# closed and hearing her breathe gently he believed she had dropped asleep and left the #apartment# on tiptoe closing the #door# after him with the utmost precaution
the #countess# made no reply she fell into so deep a reverie that her #eye# gradually closed this devil of a #fellow# he muttered shaking his #head#
i said at the #time# he would create a sensation here and i measure his #effect# by an infallible thermometer my #mother# has noticed him and he must therefore perforce be remarkable
he went down to the stables not without some slight annoyance when he remembered that the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ had laid his #hand# on a turnout which sent his bays down to second #place# in the #opinion# of connoisseurs
most decidedly said he #man# are not equal and i must beg my #father# to develop this theorem in the #chamber# of peers
meanwhile the #count# had arrived at his $house_of_peers$ it had taken him six #minute# to perform the #distance# but these six #minute# were sufficient to induce twenty young #man# who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase themselves to put their #horse# in a gallop in #order# to see the rich foreigner who could afford to give #franc# apiece for his #horse#
the $house_of_peers$ $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ had chosen and which was to serve as a town residence to $m_de_monte_cristo$ was situated on the #right# #hand# as you ascend the champs élysées
a thick clump of #tree# and shrubs rose in the centre and masked a portion of the front around this shrubbery two alleys like two #arm# extended #right# and left and formed a #carriage# drive from the #iron# #gate# to a double portico on every #step# of which stood a porcelain vase filled with flowers
#chapter# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_bertuccio$ this $house_of_peers$ isolated from the #rest# had besides the main entrance another in the rue de ponthieu
even before the coachman had hailed the concierge the massy #gate# rolled on their hinges they had seen the #count# coming and at paris as everywhere else he was served with the rapidity of lightning
the coachman entered and traversed the #half# circle without slackening his speed and the #gate# were closed ere the wheels had ceased to #sound# on the gravel
the #carriage# stopped at the left #side# of the portico two #man# presented themselves at the #carriage# #window# the #one# was $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ who smiling with an #expression# of the most sincere #joy# seemed amply repaid by a mere #look# from $m_de_monte_cristo$
the #other# bowed respectfully and offered his #arm# to assist the #count# in descending #thank# $m_bertuccio$ said the #count# springing lightly up the three #step# of the portico
and the #notary# he is in the small salon #excellency# returned $m_bertuccio$ and the cards i ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the number of the $house_of_peers$
your #excellency# it is done already i have been myself to the best engraver of the palais royal who did the plate in my #presence#
the first card struck off was taken according to your #order# to the #baron# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ rue de la chaussée antin no the #other# are on the mantle #piece# of your #excellency#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ gave his hat cane and gloves to the same french footman who had called his #carriage# at the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and then he passed into the small salon preceded by $m_bertuccio$ who showed him the #way#
bedroom good what clock is it four clock these are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber said $m_de_monte_cristo$
i trust all this #will# soon be taken away $m_bertuccio$ bowed as the steward had said the #notary# awaited him in the small salon
he was a simple looking lawyer clerk elevated to the extraordinary dignity of a provincial scrivener you are the #notary# empowered to sell the #country# $house_of_peers$ that i #wish# to purchase $monsieur_cavalcanti$ asked $m_de_monte_cristo$
yes #count# returned the #notary# is the deed of sale ready yes #count# have you brought it
very well and where is this $house_of_peers$ that i purchase asked the #count# carelessly addressing himself #half# to $m_bertuccio$ #half# to the #notary#
here it is the steward made a gesture that signified i do not know the #notary# looked at the #count# with #astonishment#
what said he does not the #count# know where the $house_of_peers$ he purchases is situated no returned the #count#
i have never before been at paris and it is the first #time# i have ever even set my #foot# in france
the #count# does not know how should i know i have arrived from cadiz this #morning# ah that is different the $house_of_peers$ you purchase is at $auteuil$
close by here $monsieur_cavalcanti$ replied the #notary# a little beyond passy a charming situation in the #heart# of the bois de boulogne
at these #word# $m_bertuccio$ turned pale and where is $auteuil$ asked the #count# so near as that said the #count#
but that is not in the #country# what made you choose a $house_of_peers$ at the #gate# of paris $m_bertuccio$
i cried the steward with a strange #expression# his #excellency# did not charge me to purchase this $house_of_peers$ if his #excellency# #will# recollect if he #will# think ah true observed $m_de_monte_cristo$
i recollect now i read the advertisement in #one# of the #paper# and was tempted by the false title a #country# $house_of_peers$
and if your #excellency# #will# intrust me with the commission i #will# find you a better at enghien at fontenay aux roses or at bellevue
it is not yet too late cried $m_bertuccio$ eagerly oh no returned $m_de_monte_cristo$ negligently since i have this i #will# keep it
and you are quite #right# said the #notary# who feared to lose his fee it is a charming #place# well supplied with spring #water# and fine #tree#
a comfortable habitation although abandoned for a long #time# without reckoning the furniture which although old is yet valuable now that old #thing# are so much sought after
i suppose the #count# has the tastes of the #day# to be sure returned $m_de_monte_cristo$ it is very convenient then
it is more it is magnificent peste let us not lose such an opportunity returned $m_de_monte_cristo$
and he signed it rapidly after having first run his #eye# over that #part# of the deed in which were specified the situation of the $house_of_peers$ and the #name# of the proprietors
the steward left the #room# with a faltering #step# and returned with a bundle of bank #note# which the #notary# counted like a #man# who never gives a receipt for #money# until after he is sure it is all there
the deed if you please mr #notary# $m_bertuccio$ said he give fifty five thousand #franc# to $monsieur_cavalcanti$
they are in the #hand# of the concierge who takes #care# of the $house_of_peers$ but here is the #order# i have given him to install the #count# in his new #possession#
and now demanded the #count# are all the forms complied with all #sir# have you the keys
very well and $m_de_monte_cristo$ made a #sign# with his #hand# to the #notary# which said i have no further need of you you may go
but observed the honest #notary# the #count# is i think mistaken it is only fifty thousand #franc# #everything# included
and your fee is included in this #sum# but have you not come from $auteuil$ here
well then it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of #time# and trouble said the #count# and he made a gesture of polite dismissal
the #notary# left the #room# backwards and bowing down to the #ground# it was the first #time# he had ever met a similar client
yes certainly see this #gentleman# out said the #count# to $m_bertuccio$ and the steward followed the #notary# out of the #room#
scarcely was the #count# alone when he drew from his #pocket# a book closed with a lock and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck and which never left him
after having sought for a few #minute# he stopped at a leaf which had several #note# and compared them with the deed of sale which lay on the #table# and recalling his souvenirs
$auteuil$ rue de la fontaine no it is indeed the same said he and now am i to rely upon an avowal extorted by religious or physical #terror#
however in an #hour# i shall know all $m_bertuccio$ cried he striking a #light# hammer with a pliant handle on a small gong
$m_bertuccio$ the steward appeared at the #door# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_bertuccio$ said the #count# did you never tell me that you had travelled in france
no #excellency# no returned the steward with a #sort# of nervous trembling which $m_de_monte_cristo$ a connoisseur in all #emotion# rightly attributed to great disquietude
it is unfortunate returned he that you have never visited the environs for i #wish# to see my new property this #evening# and had you gone with me you could have given me some useful information
in some #part# of france yes #excellency# you know the environs of paris then to $auteuil$
cried $m_bertuccio$ whose copper complexion became livid i go to $auteuil$ well what is there surprising in that when i live at $auteuil$ you must come there as you belong to my #service#
$m_bertuccio$ hung down his #head# before the imperious #look# of his #master# and remained motionless without making any #answer#
why what has happened to you are you going to make me ring a second #time# for the #carriage# asked $m_de_monte_cristo$ in the same #tone# that $louis_xviii$ xiv
pronounced the famous i have been almost obliged to wait $m_bertuccio$ made but #one# bound to the antechamber and cried in a hoarse #voice#
his #excellency# #horse# $m_de_monte_cristo$ wrote two or three #note# and as he sealed the last the steward appeared
your #excellency# #carriage# is at the #door# said he well take your hat and gloves returned $m_de_monte_cristo$
am i to accompany you your #excellency# cried $m_bertuccio$ certainly you must give the #order# for i intend residing at the $house_of_peers$
it was unexampled for a #servant# of the #count# to dare to dispute an #order# of his so the steward without saying a #word# followed his #master# who got into the #carriage# and signed to him to follow which he did taking his #place# respectfully on the front #seat#
the $house_of_peers$ at $auteuil$ $m_de_monte_cristo$ noticed as they descended the #staircase# that $m_bertuccio$ signed himself in the corsican #manner# that is had formed the #sign# of the cross in the #air# with his thumb and as he seated himself in the #carriage# muttered a short prayer
#anyone# but a #man# of exhaustless thirst for knowledge would have had #pity# on seeing the steward extraordinary repugnance for the #count# projected drive without the #wall# but the #count# was too curious to let $m_bertuccio$ off from this little journey
#chapter# in twenty #minute# they were at $auteuil$ the steward #emotion# had continued to augment as they entered the village
tell them to stop at rue de la fontaine no said the #count# fixing his #eye# on the steward to whom he gave this #order#
$m_bertuccio$ #forehead# was covered with perspiration however he obeyed and leaning out of the #window# he cried to the coachman rue de la fontaine no
$m_bertuccio$ crouched in the #corner# of the #carriage# began to examine with a feverish anxiety every $house_of_peers$ they passed
no was situated at the extremity of the village during the drive #night# had set in and #darkness# gave the surroundings the artificial #appearance# of a #scene# on the stage
the #carriage# stopped the footman sprang off the #box# and opened the #door# well said the #count# you do not get out
$m_bertuccio$ sprang out and offered his #shoulder# to the #count# who this #time# leaned upon it as he descended the three #step# of the #carriage#
$m_bertuccio$ you are going to stay in the #carriage# then what are you thinking of this #evening# knock said the #count# and announce me
$m_bertuccio$ knocked the #door# opened and the concierge appeared what is it asked he it is your new #master# my good #fellow# said the footman
and he held out to the concierge the #notary# #order# the $house_of_peers$ is sold then demanded the concierge and this #gentleman# is coming to live here
yes my #friend# returned the #count# and i #will# endeavor to give you no cause to regret your old #master#
oh $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said the concierge i shall not have much cause to regret him for he came here but seldom
it is five #year# since he was here last and he did well to sell the $house_of_peers$ for it did not bring him in #anything# at all
what was the #name# of your old #master# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ the marquis of $madame_de_saint_méran$ ah i am sure he has not sold the $house_of_peers$ for what he gave for it
the marquis of $madame_de_saint_méran$ returned the #count# the #name# is not unknown to me the marquis of $madame_de_saint_méran$ and he appeared to meditate
an old #gentleman# continued the concierge a staunch follower of the bourbons he had an only #daughter# who married $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who had been the #king# attorney at nîmes and afterwards at versailles
$m_de_monte_cristo$ glanced at $m_bertuccio$ who became whiter than the #wall# against which he leaned to prevent himself from falling
and is not this #daughter# dead demanded $m_de_monte_cristo$ i fancy i have heard so yes $monsieur_cavalcanti$ #one# and twenty #year# ago and since then we have not seen the poor marquis three #time#
#thank# #thank# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ judging from the steward utter prostration that he could not stretch the cord further without danger of breaking it
give me a #light# shall i accompany you $monsieur_cavalcanti$ no it is unnecessary $m_bertuccio$ #will# show me a #light#
and $m_de_monte_cristo$ accompanied these #word# by the gift of two #gold# #piece# which produced a torrent of #thank# and blessings from the concierge
ah $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said he after having vainly searched on the mantle #piece# and the shelves i have not got any candles
the steward obeyed in #silence# but it was easy to see from the #manner# in which the #hand# that held the #light# trembled how much it cost him to obey
they went over a tolerably large #ground# #floor# a first #floor# consisted of a salon a bathroom and two bedrooms near #one# of the bedrooms they came to a winding #staircase# that led down to the #garden#
take #one# of the #carriage# lamps $m_bertuccio$ said the #count# and show me the #apartment# ah here is a private #staircase# said the #count# that is convenient
#light# me $m_bertuccio$ and go first we #will# see where it leads to $monsieur_cavalcanti$ replied $m_bertuccio$ it leads to the #garden#
and pray how do you know that it ought to do so at least well let us be sure of that
$m_bertuccio$ sighed and went on first the stairs did indeed lead to the #garden# at the outer #door# the steward paused
but he who was addressed stood there stupefied bewildered stunned his haggard #eye# glanced around as if in search of the traces of some terrible #event# and with his clenched #hand# he seemed striving to shut out horrible recollections
go on $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_bertuccio$ said the #count# well insisted the #count# no no cried $m_bertuccio$ setting down the lantern at the angle of the interior #wall#
no $monsieur_cavalcanti$ it is impossible i can go no farther what does this #mean# demanded the irresistible #voice# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
why you must see your #excellency# cried the steward that this is not natural that having a $house_of_peers$ to purchase you purchase it exactly at $auteuil$ and that purchasing it at $auteuil$ this $house_of_peers$ should be no rue de la fontaine
i hoped your $house_of_peers$ would have been some #other# #one# than this as if there was not another $house_of_peers$ at $auteuil$ than that of the assassination
oh why did i not tell you all i am sure you would not have forced me to come
what what cried $m_de_monte_cristo$ stopping suddenly what #word# do you utter devil of a #man# corsican that you are always mysteries or superstitions
come take the lantern and let us #visit# the #garden# you are not afraid of ghosts with me i #hope#
the #door# as it opened disclosed a gloomy sky in which the moon strove vainly to struggle through a #sea# of clouds that covered her with billows of vapor which she illumined for an #instant# only to sink into obscurity
$m_bertuccio$ raised the lantern and obeyed the steward wished to #turn# to the left no no $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said $m_de_monte_cristo$
what is the #use# of following the alleys here is a beautiful lawn let us go on straight forwards
$m_bertuccio$ wiped the perspiration from his #brow# but obeyed however he continued to take the left #hand# $m_de_monte_cristo$ on the #contrary# took the #right# #hand# arrived near a clump of #tree# he stopped
the steward could not restrain himself move $monsieur_cavalcanti$ move away i entreat you you are exactly in the #spot#
what #spot# where he fell my dear $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_bertuccio$ said $m_de_monte_cristo$ laughing control yourself we are not at sartène or at corte
this is not a corsican maquis but an english #garden# badly kept i own but still you must not calumniate it for that
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ i implore you do not stay there i think you are going mad $m_bertuccio$ said the #count# coldly
alas #excellency# returned $m_bertuccio$ joining his #hand# and shaking his #head# in a #manner# that would have excited the #count# laughter had not #thought# of a superior #interest# occupied him and rendered him attentive to the least revelation of this timorous conscience
if that is the #case# i warn you i shall have you put in a lunatic asylum
i am very glad to tell you that while you gesticulate you wring your #hand# and roll your #eye# like a #man# possessed by a devil who #will# not leave him and i have always observed that the devil most obstinate to be expelled is a #secret#
i knew you were gloomy and always brooding over some old history of the vendetta and i overlooked that in italy because in italy those #thing# are #thought# #nothing# of
but in france they are considered in very bad taste there are gendarmes who occupy themselves with such #affair# judges who condemn and scaffolds which avenge
$m_bertuccio$ clasped his #hand# and as in all these evolutions he did not let fall the lantern the #light# showed his pale and altered #countenance#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ examined him with the same #look# that at rome he had bent upon the execution of $andrea_rondolo$ and then in a #tone# that made a shudder pass through the veins of the poor steward
the $abbé_busoni$ then told me an untruth said he when after his journey in france in he sent you to me with a #letter# of recommendation in which he enumerated all your valuable qualities
well i shall write to the #abbé# i shall hold him responsible for his protégé misconduct and i shall soon know all about this assassination
only i warn you that when i reside in a #country# i conform to all its code and i have no #wish# to put myself within the compass of the french #law# for your sake
alas #excellency# the evil has arrived $m_bertuccio$ said the #count# i knew you were a corsican
oh do not do that #excellency# i have always served you faithfully cried $m_bertuccio$ in #despair# i have always been an honest #man# and as far as lay in my #power# i have done good
it is a bad #sign# a quiet conscience does not occasion such paleness in the cheeks and such fever in the #hand# of a #man#
i do not deny it returned the #count# but why are you thus agitated but your #excellency# replied $m_bertuccio$ hesitatingly
did not the $abbé_busoni$ who heard my confession in the #prison# at nîmes tell you that i had a heavy burden upon my conscience
yes but as he said you would make an excellent steward i concluded you had stolen that was all
or as you are a corsican that you had been unable to resist the #desire# of making a stiff as you call it
oh your #excellency# returned $m_bertuccio$ in deep contempt yes my good #master# cried $m_bertuccio$ casting himself at the #count# #foot#
it was simply vengeance #nothing# else i understand that but i do not understand what it is that galvanizes you in this #manner#
but $monsieur_cavalcanti$ it is very natural returned $m_bertuccio$ since it was in this $house_of_peers$ that my vengeance was accomplished
what my $house_of_peers$ oh your #excellency# it was not yours then whose then the marquis de $madame_de_saint_méran$ i think the concierge said
what had you to revenge on the marquis de $madame_de_saint_méran$ oh it was not on him $monsieur_cavalcanti$ it was on another
this is strange returned $m_de_monte_cristo$ seeming to yield to his reflections that you should find yourself without any preparation in a $house_of_peers$ where the #event# happened that causes you so much remorse
first you purchase a $house_of_peers$ at $auteuil$ this $house_of_peers$ is the #one# where i have committed an assassination you descend to the #garden# by the same #staircase# by which he descended you stop at the #spot# where he received the blow and two paces farther is the grave in which he had just buried his #child#
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ said the steward it is fatality i am sure this is not #chance# for #chance# in this #case# is too much like providence
well amiable corsican let us suppose it is providence i always suppose #anything# #people# please and besides you must concede #something# to diseased #mind#
come collect yourself and tell me all i have related it but once and that was to the $abbé_busoni$
such #thing# continued $m_bertuccio$ shaking his #head# are only related under the seal of confession then said the #count#
#turn# chartreux or trappist and relate your #secret# but as for me i do not like #anyone# who is alarmed by such phantasms and i do not choose that my #servant# should be afraid to walk in the #garden# of an #evening#
i confess i am not very desirous of a #visit# from the commissary of #police# for in italy #justice# is only paid when silent in france she is paid only when she speaks
i #thought# you somewhat corsican a great deal smuggler and an excellent steward but i see you have #other# strings to your bow
i refer you to your confessor peste you are no longer in my #service# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_bertuccio$ oh your #excellency# your #excellency#
if that is the only #reason# i cannot remain in your #service# i #will# tell all for if i quit you it #will# only be to go to the scaffold
cried the steward struck with #terror# at this threat that is different replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ but if you intend to tell an untruth reflect it were better not to speak at all
no $monsieur_cavalcanti$ i swear to you by my #hope# of salvation i #will# tell you all for the $abbé_busoni$ himself only knew a #part# of my #secret# but i pray you go away from that plane #tree#
the moon is just bursting through the clouds and there standing where you do and wrapped in that cloak that conceals your figure you remind me of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
what cried $m_de_monte_cristo$ it was $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ your #excellency# knows him
the former royal attorney at nîmes yes who married the marquis of $madame_de_saint_méran$ #daughter#
yes who enjoyed the reputation of being the most severe the most upright the most rigid #magistrate# on the bench
well $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said $m_bertuccio$ this #man# with this spotless reputation well was a villain bah replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ impossible
it is as i tell you ah really said $m_de_monte_cristo$ have you #proof# of this
i had it and you have lost it how stupid yes but by careful search it might be recovered
and the #count# humming an #air# from lucia went to sit down on a bench while $m_bertuccio$ followed him collecting his #thought#
really returned the #count# relate it to me for it begins to #interest# me $m_bertuccio$ remained standing before him
#chapter# the vendetta at what #point# shall i begin my #story# your #excellency# asked $m_bertuccio$ where you please returned $m_de_monte_cristo$ since i know #nothing# at all of it
i #thought# the $abbé_busoni$ had told your #excellency# some particulars doubtless but that is seven or eight #year# ago and i have forgotten them
then i can speak without #fear# of tiring your #excellency# go on $m_bertuccio$ you #will# supply the want of the #evening# #paper#
the #story# begins in ah said $m_de_monte_cristo$ is not #yesterday# no $monsieur_cavalcanti$ and yet i recollect all #thing# as clearly as if they had happened but
i had a #brother# an elder #brother# who was in the #service# of the emperor he had become lieutenant in a regiment composed entirely of corsicans
then this #brother# was my only #friend# we became orphans i at five he at eighteen he brought me up as if i had been his #son# and in he married
when the emperor returned from the #island# of $elba$ my #brother# instantly joined the army was slightly wounded at waterloo and retired with the army beyond the loire
but that is the history of the hundred #day# $m_bertuccio$ said the #count# unless i am mistaken it has been already written
excuse me #excellency# but these details are necessary and you promised to be patient go on i #will# keep my #word#
#one# #day# we received a #letter# i should tell you that we lived in the little village of rogliano at the extremity of cap corse
he told us that the army was disbanded and that he should #return# by châteauroux clermont ferrand le puy and nîmes and if i had any #money# he prayed me to leave it for him at nîmes with an innkeeper with whom i had dealings
this #letter# was from my #brother# in the smuggling #line# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ eh your #excellency# #everyone# must live
i loved my #brother# tenderly as i told your #excellency# and i resolved not to send the #money# but to take it to him myself
certainly go on i possessed a thousand #franc# i left five hundred with $assunta$ my sister in #law# and with the #other# five hundred i set off for nîmes
it was easy to do so and as i had my #boat# and a lading to take in at #sea# #everything# favored my project
but after we had taken in our cargo the wind became #contrary# so that we were four or five #day# without being able to enter the rhône
at last however we succeeded and worked up to arles i left the #boat# between bellegarde and beaucaire and took the #road# to nîmes
we are getting to the #story# now yes your #excellency# excuse me but as you #will# see i only tell you what is absolutely necessary
just at this #time# the famous massacres took #place# in the south of france three brigands called trestaillon truphemy and graffan publicly assassinated everybody whom they suspected of bonapartism
you have doubtless heard of these massacres your #excellency# vaguely i was far from france at that period go on
as i entered nîmes i literally waded in #blood# at every #step# you encountered dead #body# and bands of murderers who killed plundered and burned
for i a simple corsican fisherman had #nothing# to #fear# on the #contrary# that #time# was most favorable for us smugglers but for my #brother# a #soldier# of the empire returning from the army of the loire with his uniform and his epaulets there was #everything# to apprehend
at the #sight# of this slaughter and devastation i became terrified not for myself i hastened to the innkeeper
my #brother# had arrived the previous #evening# at nîmes and at the very #door# of the $house_of_peers$ where he was about to demand hospitality he had been assassinated
i did all in my #power# to discover the murderers but no #one# durst tell me their #name# so much were they dreaded
i then #thought# of that french #justice# of which i had heard so much and which feared #nothing# and i went to the #king# attorney
my misgivings had been but too true and this #king# attorney was named $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ asked $m_de_monte_cristo$ carelessly
his zeal had procured him advancement and he was said to be #one# of the first who had informed the government of the departure from the #island# of $elba$
yes your #excellency# he came from marseilles where he had been deputy #procureur# then said $m_de_monte_cristo$ you went to him
my #brother# was assassinated #yesterday# in the #street# of nîmes i know not by whom but it is your #duty# to find out
you are the representative of #justice# here and it is for #justice# to avenge those she has been unable to protect
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ i said who was your #brother# asked he a lieutenant in the corsican battalion
a #soldier# of the usurper then a #soldier# of the french army
well replied he he has smitten with the sword and he has perished by the sword you are mistaken $monsieur_cavalcanti$ i replied he has perished by the poniard
what do you want me to do asked the #magistrate# i have already told you avenge him
on whom on his murderers how should i know who they are
#order# them to be sought for why your #brother# has been involved in a quarrel and killed in a duel
all these old #soldier# commit excesses which were tolerated in the #time# of the emperor but which are not suffered now for the #people# here do not like #soldier# of such disorderly conduct
i should grieve for him or avenge him but my poor #brother# had a #wife# and were #anything# to happen to me the poor creature would perish from want for my #brother# pay alone kept her
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ i replied it is not for myself that i entreat your interference pray try and obtain a small government pension for her
every revolution has its catastrophes returned $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ your #brother# has been the victim of this it is a #misfortune# and government owes #nothing# to his #family#
if we are to judge by all the vengeance that the followers of the usurper exercised on the partisans of the #king# when in their #turn# they were in #power# your #brother# would be #today# in all probability condemned to #death#
what has happened is quite natural and in conformity with the #law# of reprisals what cried i do you a #magistrate# speak thus to me
all these corsicans are mad on my #honor# replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ they fancy that their countryman is still emperor
you have mistaken the #time# you should have told me this two #month# ago it is too late now go now at once or i shall have you put out
i looked at him an #instant# to see if there was #anything# to #hope# from further entreaty but he was a #man# of #stone#
i approached him and said in a low #voice# well since you know the corsicans so well you know that they always keep their #word#
you think that it was a good deed to kill my #brother# who was a bonapartist because you are a royalist
from this #moment# i declare the vendetta against you so protect yourself as well as you can for the next #time# we meet your last #hour# has come
well i who am a bonapartist also declare #one# #thing# to you which is that i #will# kill you and before he had recovered from his surprise i opened the #door# and left the #room#
well well said $m_de_monte_cristo$ such an innocent looking #person# as you are to do those #thing# $m_bertuccio$ and to a #king# attorney at that
he knew so well that from that #moment# he shut himself in his $house_of_peers$ and never went out unattended seeking me high and low
but did he know what was meant by the terrible #word# vendetta fortunately i was so well concealed that he could not find me
then he became alarmed and dared not stay any longer at nîmes so he solicited a change of residence and as he was in reality very influential he was nominated to versailles
but as you know a corsican who has sworn to avenge himself #care# not for #distance# so his #carriage# fast as it went was never above #half# a #day#
the most important #thing# was not to kill him only for i had an opportunity of doing so a hundred #time# but to kill him without being discovered at least without being arrested
journey before me who followed him on #foot# i no longer belonged to myself for i had my sister in #law# to protect and provide for
for three #month# i watched $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ for three #month# he took not a #step# out of #door# without my following him
i followed him thither and i saw him enter the $house_of_peers$ where we now are only instead of entering by the great #door# that #look# into the #street# he came on horseback or in his #carriage# left the #one# or the #other# at the little inn and entered by the #gate# you see there
$m_de_monte_cristo$ made a #sign# with his #head# to show that he could discern in the #darkness# the #door# to which $m_bertuccio$ alluded
at #length# i discovered that he went mysteriously to $auteuil$ as i had #nothing# more to do at versailles i went to $auteuil$ and gained all the information i could
if i wished to surprise him it was evident this was the #spot# to lie in wait for him the $house_of_peers$ belonged as the concierge informed your #excellency# to de $madame_de_saint_méran$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #father# in #law#
m de $madame_de_saint_méran$ lived at marseilles so that this #country# $house_of_peers$ was useless to him and it was reported to be let to a young widow known only by the #name# of the #baroness#
#one# #evening# as i was looking over the #wall# i saw a young and handsome #woman# who was walking alone in that #garden# which was not overlooked by any #window# and i guessed that she was awaiting $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
when she was sufficiently near for me to distinguish her #feature# i saw she was from eighteen to nineteen tall and very fair
as she had a loose muslin dress on and as #nothing# concealed her figure i saw she would ere long become a #mother#
a few #moment# after the little #door# was opened and a #man# entered the young #woman# hastened to meet him
the #man# was $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i fully believed that when he went out in the #night# he would be forced to traverse the whole of the #garden# alone
they threw themselves into each #other# #arm# embraced tenderly and returned together to the $house_of_peers$ and asked the #count# did you ever know the #name# of this #woman#
no #excellency# returned $m_bertuccio$ you #will# see that i had no #time# to learn it go on
i could have killed the #procureur# but as i was not sufficiently acquainted with the neighborhood i was fearful of not killing him on the #spot# and that if his #cry# were overheard i might be taken so i put it off until the next occasion and in #order# that #nothing# should escape me i took a #chamber# looking into the #street# bordered by the #wall# of the #garden#
three #day# after about seven clock in the #evening# i saw a #servant# on horseback leave the $house_of_peers$ at full gallop and take the #road# to sèvres
three #hour# later the #man# returned covered with dust his errand was performed and two #minute# after another #man# on #foot# muffled in a mantle opened the little #door# of the #garden# which he closed after him
that #evening# continued $m_bertuccio$ i concluded that he was going to versailles and i was not deceived i descended rapidly although i had not seen $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #face# i recognized him by the beating of my #heart#
i crossed the #street# and stopped at a post placed at the angle of the #wall# and by #mean# of which i had once before looked into the #garden#
this #time# i did not content myself with looking but i took my knife out of my #pocket# felt that the #point# was sharp and sprang over the #wall#
my first #care# was to run to the #door# he had left the key in it taking the simple precaution of turning it twice in the lock
the #garden# was long and narrow a stretch of smooth turf extended down the middle and at the #corner# were clumps of #tree# with thick and massy foliage that made a background for the shrubs and flowers
in #order# to go from the #door# to the $house_of_peers$ or from the $house_of_peers$ to the #door# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ would be obliged to pass by #one# of these clumps of #tree#
#nothing# then preventing my escape by this #mean# i examined the #ground# it was the #end# of september the wind blew violently
the faint glimpses of the pale moon hidden momentarily by masses of dark clouds that were sweeping across the sky whitened the gravel walks that led to the $house_of_peers$ but were unable to pierce the obscurity of the thick shrubberies in which a #man# could conceal himself without any #fear# of discovery
amidst the gusts of wind i fancied i heard groans but you know or rather you do not know your #excellency#
i hid myself in the #one# nearest to the path $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ must take and scarcely was i there when that he who is about to commit an assassination fancies that he hears low #cry# perpetually ringing in his ears
as the last stroke died away i saw a faint #light# shine through the #window# of the private #staircase# by which we have just descended
two #hour# passed thus during which i imagined i heard moans repeatedly midnight struck the #door# opened and the #man# in the mantle reappeared
the terrible #moment# had come but i had so long been prepared for it that my #heart# did not fail in the least
the #man# in the mantle advanced towards me but as he drew near i saw that he had a weapon in his #hand#
i drew my knife from my #pocket# again opened it and made ready to strike i was afraid not of a struggle but of a failure
when he was only a few paces from me i saw that what i had taken for a weapon was only a spade
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had this spade in his #hand# when he stopped close to the thicket where i was glanced round and began to dig a hole in the #earth#
i then perceived that he was hiding #something# under his mantle which he laid on the grass in #order# to dig more freely
then i confess curiosity mingled with hatred i wished to see what $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was going to do there and i remained motionless holding my breath
then an #idea# crossed my #mind# which was confirmed when i saw the #procureur# lift from under his mantle a #box# two #foot# long and six or eight inches deep
i was still unable to divine for what #reason# i let him #place# the #box# in the hole he had made then
while he stamped with his #foot# to remove all traces of his occupation i rushed on him and plunged my knife into his breast exclaiming
i am giovanni $m_bertuccio$ thy #death# for my #brother# thy #treasure# for his widow thou seest that my vengeance is more complete than i had hoped
i know not if he heard these #word# i think he did not for he fell without a #cry#
i felt his #blood# gush over my #face# but i was intoxicated i was delirious and the #blood# refreshed instead of burning me
i filled up the hole threw the spade over the #wall# and rushed through the #door# which i double locked carrying off the key
in a second i had disinterred the #box# then that it might not be known i had done so
ah said $m_de_monte_cristo$ it seems to me this was #nothing# but murder and robbery no your #excellency# returned $m_bertuccio$ it was a vendetta followed by restitution
and was the #sum# a large #one# it was not #money# ah i recollect replied the #count# did you not say #something# of an infant
i hastened to the river sat down on the bank and with my knife forced open the lock of the #box#
its purple visage and its violet colored #hand# showed that it had perished from suffocation but as it was not yet cold i hesitated to throw it into the #water# that ran at my #foot#
after a #moment# i fancied that i felt a slight pulsation of the #heart# and as i had been assistant at the hospital at bastia i did what a #doctor# would have done
i inflated the lungs by blowing #air# into them and at the expiration of a #quarter# of an #hour# it began to breathe and cried feebly
yes #excellency# in a fine linen cloth was wrapped a new born #child# in my #turn# i uttered a #cry# but a #cry# of #joy#
since he permits me to save the #life# of a human creature in exchange for the #life# i have taken away
god has not cursed me then i cried and what did you do with the #child#
i had not for a #moment# the #idea# of keeping it but i knew that at paris there was an asylum where they receive such creatures
as i passed the city #gate# i declared that i had found the #child# on the #road# and i inquired where the asylum was the #box# confirmed my statement the linen proved that the infant belonged to wealthy parents the #blood# with which i was covered might have proceeded from the #child# as well as from #anyone# else
no objection was raised but they pointed out the asylum which was situated at the upper #end# of the rue enfer and after having taken the precaution of cutting the linen in two #piece# so that #one# of the two #letter# which marked it was on the #piece# wrapped around the #child# while the #other# remained in my #possession# i rang the bell and fled with all speed
asked $m_de_monte_cristo$ it was an embarrassing load for a #man# seeking to escape a fortnight after i was at rogliano and i said to $assunta$
console thyself sister israel is dead but he is avenged she demanded what i meant and when i had told her all giovanni said she
you should have brought this #child# with you we would have replaced the parents it has lost have called it $m_benedetto$ and then in consequence of this good action god would have blessed us
in reply i gave her the #half# of the linen i had kept in #order# to reclaim him if we became rich
what #letter# were marked on the linen said $m_de_monte_cristo$ an and an surmounted by a #baron# coronet
by heaven $m_bertuccio$ you make #use# of heraldic terms where did you #study# heraldry in your #service# #excellency# where #everything# is learned
go on i am curious to know two #thing# what are they your #excellency# what became of this little #boy#
for i think you told me it was a #boy# $m_bertuccio$ no #excellency# i do not recollect telling you that
i #thought# you did i must have been mistaken no you were not for it was in reality a little #boy#
the second was the #crime# of which you were accused when you asked for a confessor and the $abbé_busoni$ came to #visit# you at your request in the #prison# at nîmes
but your #excellency# wished to know two #thing# what was the second the #story# #will# be very long #excellency#
what #matter# you know i take but little sleep and i do not suppose you are very much inclined for it either
partly to drown the recollections of the past that haunted me partly to supply the wants of the poor widow i eagerly returned to my trade of smuggler which had become more easy since that relaxation of the #law# which always follows a revolution
the southern districts were ill watched in particular in consequence of the disturbances that were perpetually breaking out in avignon nîmes or uzès
$m_bertuccio$ bowed and resumed his #story# we profited by this respite on the #part# of the government to make #friend# everywhere
since my #brother# assassination in the #street# of nîmes i had never entered the town the result was that the innkeeper with whom we were connected seeing that we would no longer come to him was forced to come to us and had established a branch to his inn on the #road# from bellegarde to beaucaire at the #sign# of the pont du gard
we had thus at aigues mortes martigues or bouc a dozen #place# where we left our goods and where in #case# of necessity we concealed ourselves from the gendarmes and custom $house_of_peers$ #officer#
smuggling is a profitable trade when a certain degree of vigor and intelligence is employed as for myself brought up in the mountains i had a double motive for fearing the gendarmes and custom $house_of_peers$ #officer# as my #appearance# before the judges would cause an inquiry and an inquiry always #look# back into the past
and in my past #life# they might find #something# far more grave than the selling of smuggled cigars or barrels of brandy without a permit
so preferring #death# to capture i accomplished the most astonishing deeds and which more than once showed me that the too great #care# we take of our #body# is the only obstacle to the success of those projects which require rapid decision and vigorous and determined execution
in reality when you have once devoted your #life# to your enterprises you are no longer the equal of #other# #man# or rather #other# #man# are no longer your equals and whosoever has taken this resolution feels his #strength# and resources doubled
philosophy $m_bertuccio$ interrupted the #count# you have done a little of #everything# in your #life# oh #excellency#
no no but philosophy at #half# past ten at #night# is somewhat late yet i have no #other# observation to make for what you say is correct which is more than can be said for all philosophy
my journeys became more and more extensive and more productive $assunta$ took #care# of all and our little #fortune# increased
#one# #day# as i was setting off on an expedition go said she at your #return# i #will# give you a surprise
our expedition lasted nearly six weeks we had been to lucca to take in oil to leghorn for english cottons and we ran our cargo without opposition and returned home full of #joy#
when i entered the $house_of_peers$ the first #thing# i beheld in the middle of $assunta$ #chamber# was a cradle that might be called sumptuous compared with the #rest# of the furniture and in it a baby seven or eight #month# old
i uttered a #cry# of #joy# the only #moment# of sadness i had known since the assassination of the #procureur# were caused by the recollection that i had abandoned this #child#
i questioned her but in vain she would tell me #nothing# and i departed for the assassination itself i had never felt any remorse
she had profited by my absence and furnished with the #half# of the linen and having written down the #day# and #hour# at which i had deposited the #child# at the asylum had set off for paris and had reclaimed it
ah i confess your #excellency# when i saw this poor creature sleeping peacefully in its cradle i felt my #eye# filled with #tear#
poor $assunta$ had guessed all no objection was raised and the infant was given up to her ah $assunta$ cried i
you are an excellent #woman# and heaven #will# bless you this said $m_de_monte_cristo$ is less correct than your philosophy it
is only faith alas your #excellency# is #right# replied $m_bertuccio$ and god made this infant the instrument of our punishment
never did a perverse #nature# declare itself more prematurely and yet it was not owing to any fault in his bringing up
he was a most lovely #child# with large blue #eye# of that deep color that harmonizes so well with the blond complexion only his #hair# which was too #light# gave his #face# a most singular #expression# and added to the vivacity of his #look# and the malice of his #smile#
unfortunately there is a proverb which says that red is either altogether good or altogether bad the proverb was but too correct as regarded $m_benedetto$ and even in his infancy he manifested the worst disposition
this #child# for whom my poor sister would go to the town five or six leagues off to purchase the earliest fruits and the most tempting sweetmeats preferred to palma grapes or genoese preserves the chestnuts stolen from a neighbor orchard or the dried apples in his loft when he could eat as well of the nuts and apples that grew in my #garden#
#one# #day# when $m_benedetto$ was about five or six our neighbor wasilio who according to the custom of the #country# never locked up his purse or his valuables for as your #excellency# knows there are no thieves in corsica
complained that he had lost a $louis_xviii$ out of his purse we #thought# he must have made a mistake in counting his #money# but he persisted in the accuracy of his statement
#one# #day# $m_benedetto$ who had been gone from the $house_of_peers$ since #morning# to our great anxiety did not #return# until late in the #evening# dragging a monkey after him which he said he had found chained to the #foot# of a #tree#
for more than a #month# past the mischievous #child# who knew not what to #wish# for had taken it into his #head# to have a monkey
a boatman who had passed by rogliano and who had several of these animals whose tricks had greatly diverted him had doubtless suggested this #idea# to him
it is true that the indulgence of his foster #mother# encouraged him monkeys are not found in our woods chained to #tree# said i
$m_benedetto$ maintained the #truth# of what he had said and accompanied it with details that did more #honor# to his imagination than to his veracity
confess how you obtained this animal i became angry he began to laugh i threatened to strike him and he made two #step# backwards
you cannot beat me said he you have no #right# for you are not my #father#
we never knew who had revealed this fatal #secret# which we had so carefully concealed from him however it was this #answer# in which the #child# whole character revealed itself that almost terrified me and my #arm# fell without touching him
the #boy# triumphed and this victory rendered him so audacious that all the #money# of $assunta$ whose affection for him seemed to increase as he became more unworthy of it was spent in caprices
when i was at rogliano #everything# went on properly but no sooner was my back turned than $m_benedetto$ became #master# and #everything# went ill
when he was only eleven he chose his #companion# from among the young #man# of eighteen or twenty the worst characters in bastia or indeed in corsica and they had already for some mischievous pranks been several #time# threatened with a prosecution
she knew not how to contend against and follies she had not the courage to prevent i became alarmed as any prosecution might be attended with serious consequences
i was compelled at this period to leave corsica on an important expedition i reflected for a long #time# and with the #hope# of averting some impending #misfortune# i resolved that $m_benedetto$ should accompany me
i hoped that the active and laborious #life# of a smuggler with the severe discipline on #board# would have a salutary #effect# on his character which was now well nigh if not quite corrupt
i spoke to $m_benedetto$ alone and proposed to him to accompany me endeavoring to tempt him by all the #promise# most likely to dazzle the imagination of a #child# of twelve
he heard me patiently and when i had finished burst out laughing are you mad uncle he called me by this #name# when he was in good humor
my agreeable indolence for the hard and precarious toil you impose on yourself exposed to the bitter frost at #night# and the scorching heat by #day# compelled to conceal yourself and when you are perceived receive a volley of bullets all to earn a paltry #sum#
do you think i am going to change the #life# i lead for your mode of existence why i have as much #money# as i want #mother# $assunta$ always furnishes me when i ask for it
you see that i should be a fool to accept your offer the arguments and his audacity perfectly stupefied me
$m_benedetto$ rejoined his associates and i saw him from a #distance# #point# me out to them as a fool
oh had he been my own #son# replied $m_bertuccio$ or even my nephew i would have brought him back to the #right# #road# for the knowledge that you are doing your #duty# gives you #strength# but the #idea# that i was striking a #child# whose #father# i had killed made it impossible for me to punish him
i gave my sister who constantly defended the unfortunate #boy# good advice and as she confessed that she had several #time# missed #money# to a considerable amount i showed her a safe #place# in which to conceal our little #treasure# for the future
$m_benedetto$ could read write and cipher perfectly for when the fit seized him he learned more in a #day# than #other# in a week
my intention was to enter him as a clerk in some ship and without letting him know #anything# of my #plan# to convey him some #morning# on #board# by this #mean# his future treatment would depend upon his own conduct
sweet #child# murmured $m_de_monte_cristo$ my #mind# was already made up i set off for france after having fixed upon the #plan#
our cargo was to be landed in the gulf of lyons and this was a difficult #thing# to do because it was then the #year#
the most perfect tranquillity was restored and the vigilance of the custom $house_of_peers$ #officer# was redoubled and their strictness was increased at this #time# in consequence of the fair at beaucaire
our expedition made a favorable beginning we anchored our #vessel# which had a double hold where our goods were concealed
on our arrival we began to discharge our cargo in the #night# and to convey it into the town by the help of the innkeeper with whom we were connected
whether success rendered us imprudent or whether we were betrayed i know not but #one# #evening# about five clock our little cabin #boy# came breathlessly to inform us that he had seen a detachment of custom $house_of_peers$ #officer# advancing in our direction
it was not their proximity that alarmed us for detachments were constantly patrolling along the banks of the rhône but the #care# according to the #boy# #account# that they took to avoid being seen
in an #instant# we were on the alert but it was too late our #vessel# was surrounded and amongst the custom $house_of_peers$ #officer# i observed several gendarmes and as terrified at the #sight# of their uniforms as i was brave at the #sight# of any #other# i sprang into the hold opened a port and dropped into the river dived and only rose at intervals to breathe until i reached a ditch that had recently been made from the rhône to the canal that runs from beaucaire to aigues mortes
i was now safe for i could swim along the ditch without being seen and i reached the canal in safety
amidst a number of #other# #vessel# that bordered the banks of the rhône from beaucaire to arles i had designedly taken this direction
i have already told your #excellency# of an innkeeper from nîmes who had set up a little tavern on the #road# from bellegarde to beaucaire
yes said $m_de_monte_cristo$ i perfectly recollect him i think he was your colleague precisely answered $m_bertuccio$
but he had seven or eight #year# before this period sold his establishment to a tailor at marseilles who having almost ruined himself in his old trade wished to make his #fortune# in another
of #course# we made the same arrangements with the new landlord that we had with the old and it was of this #man# that i intended to ask shelter
what was his #name# inquired the #count# who seemed to become somewhat interested in $m_bertuccio$ #story#
$gaspard_caderousse$ $m_caderousse$ he had married a #woman# from the village of $la_carconte$ and whom we did not know by any #other# #name# than that of her village
as for her #husband# he was a strapping #fellow# of forty or five and forty who had more than once in #time# of danger given ample #proof# of his #presence# of #mind# and courage
she was suffering from malarial fever and seemed dying by inches and you say interrupted $m_de_monte_cristo$ that this took #place# towards the #year#
your #excellency# in what #month# june the beginning or the #end# the #evening# of the rd
it was from $m_caderousse$ that i intended demanding shelter and as we never entered by the #door# that opened onto the #road# i resolved not to break through the rule so climbing over the #garden# hedge i crept amongst the olive and wild fig #tree# and fearing that $m_caderousse$ might have some #guest# i entered a kind of shed in which i had often passed the #night# and which was only separated from the inn by a partition in which holes had been made in #order# to enable us to watch an opportunity of announcing our #presence#
my intention was if $m_caderousse$ was alone to acquaint him with my #presence# finish the meal the custom $house_of_peers$ #officer# had interrupted and profit by the threatened storm to #return# to the rhône and ascertain the state of our #vessel# and its crew
ah said $m_de_monte_cristo$ the #evening# of the rd of june go on i stepped into the shed and it was fortunate
i waited patiently not to overhear what they said but because i could do #nothing# else besides the same #thing# had occurred often before
the #man# who was with $m_caderousse$ was evidently a #stranger# to the south of france he was #one# of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at the beaucaire fair and who during the #month# the fair lasts and during which there is so great an influx of merchants and customers from all #part# of europe often have dealings to the amount of to #franc#
i did so for at that #moment# $m_caderousse$ entered with a #stranger# $m_caderousse$ entered hastily then seeing that the #room# was as usual empty and only guarded by the dog he called to his #wife#
hello $la_carconte$ said he the worthy #priest# has not deceived us the #diamond# is real an exclamation of #joy# was heard and the #staircase# creaked beneath a feeble #step#
i say that the #diamond# is real and that this #gentleman# #one# of the first jewellers of paris #will# give us #franc# for it
only in #order# to satisfy himself that it really belongs to us he #wish# you to relate to him as i have done already the miraculous #manner# in which the #diamond# came into our #possession#
what do you say asked his #wife# pale as #death# in the meantime please to sit down $monsieur_cavalcanti$ and i #will# fetch you some refreshment
the jeweller examined attentively the interior of the inn and the apparent poverty of the #person# who were about to sell him a #diamond# that seemed to have come from the casket of a prince
relate your #story# #madame# said he wishing no #doubt# to profit by the absence of the #husband# so that the latter could not influence the #wife#
#story# to see if the two recitals tallied oh returned she it was a gift of heaven
this poor #fellow# whom $m_caderousse$ had forgotten had not forgotten him and at his #death# he bequeathed this #diamond# to him
my #husband# was a great #friend# in or of a #sailor# named $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ but how did he obtain it
no $monsieur_cavalcanti$ but it appears that in #prison# he made the acquaintance of a rich englishman and as in #prison# he fell sick and $m_dantès$ took the same #care# of him as if he had been his #brother# the englishman when he was set free gave this #stone# to $m_dantès$ who less fortunate died and in his #turn# left it to us and charged the excellent #abbé# who was here this #morning# to deliver it
asked the jeweller had he it before he was imprisoned the same #story# muttered the jeweller
and improbable as it seemed at first it may be true there only the price we are not agreed about
how not agreed about said $m_caderousse$ i #thought# we agreed for the price i asked that is replied the jeweller
i offered #franc# forty thousand cried $la_carconte$ we #will# not #part# with it for that #sum#
the #abbé# told us it was worth without the setting what was the #abbé# #name# asked the indefatigable questioner
the $abbé_busoni$ said $la_carconte$ he was a foreigner an italian from the neighborhood of mantua i believe
let me see this #diamond# again replied the jeweller the first #time# you are often mistaken as to the value of a #stone#
$m_caderousse$ took from his #pocket# a small #case# of black shagreen opened and gave it to the jeweller at the #sight# of the #diamond# which was as large as a hazel nut $la_carconte$ #eye# sparkled with cupidity
and what did you think of this fine #story# eavesdropper said $m_de_monte_cristo$ did you credit it
i did not #look# on $m_caderousse$ as a bad #man# and i #thought# him incapable of committing a #crime# or even a theft
yes your #excellency# that did more #honor# to your #heart# than to your experience $m_bertuccio$ had you known this $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ of whom they spoke
no your #excellency# i had never heard of him before and never but once afterwards and that was from the $abbé_busoni$ himself when i saw him in the #prison# at nîmes
the jeweller took the ring and #drawing# from his #pocket# a pair of steel pliers and a small set of copper scales he took the #stone# out of its setting and weighed it carefully
but not a sou more besides as that is the exact value of the #stone# i brought just that #sum# with me
go on i #will# give you said he oh that no #matter# replied $m_caderousse$
i #will# go back with you to fetch the #other# #franc# no returned the jeweller giving back the #diamond# and the ring to $m_caderousse$
no it is worth no more and i am sorry i offered so much for the #stone# has a flaw in it which i had not seen
however i #will# not go back on my #word# and i #will# give at least replace the #diamond# in the ring said $la_carconte$ sharply
ah true replied the jeweller and he reset the #stone# no #matter# observed $m_caderousse$ replacing the #box# in his #pocket#
someone else #will# purchase it yes continued the jeweller but someone else #will# not be so easy as i am or content himself with the same #story#
it is not natural that a #man# like you should possess such a #diamond# he #will# inform against you you #will# have to find the $abbé_busoni$ and abbés who give #diamond# worth two thousand $louis_xviii$ are rare
the #law# would seize it and put you in #prison# if at the #end# of three or four #month# you are set at #liberty# the ring #will# be lost or a false #stone# worth three #franc# #will# be given you instead of a #diamond# worth or perhaps #franc# from which you must allow that #one# runs considerable risk in purchasing
$m_caderousse$ and his #wife# looked eagerly at each #other# no said $m_caderousse$ we are not rich enough to lose #franc#
as you please my dear #sir# said the jeweller i had however as you see brought you the #money# in bright coin
and he drew from his #pocket# a handful of #gold# and held it sparkling before the dazzled #eye# of the innkeeper and in the #other# #hand# he held a packet of bank #note#
there was evidently a severe struggle in the #mind# of $m_caderousse$ it was plain that the small shagreen #case# which he turned over and over in his #hand# did not seem to him commensurate in value to the enormous #sum# which fascinated his gaze
he turned towards his #wife# what do you think of this he asked in a low #voice#
if he #return# to beaucaire without the #diamond# he #will# inform against us and as he says who knows if we shall ever again see the $abbé_busoni$ in all probability we shall never see him
let him have it let him have it she said well then so i #will#
said $m_caderousse$ so you may have the #diamond# for #franc# but my #wife# wants a #gold# chain and i want a pair of silver buckles
the jeweller drew from his #pocket# a long flat #box# which contained several samples of the articles demanded
the #woman# selected a #gold# chain worth about five $louis_xviii$ and the #husband# a pair of buckles worth perhaps fifteen #franc#
here he said i am very straightforward in my dealings take your choice i #hope# you #will# not complain now
said the jeweller the #abbé# told me it was worth #franc# muttered $m_caderousse$ come come give it to me
i give you #franc# that is livres of income a #fortune# such as i #wish# i had myself and you are not satisfied
what a strange #fellow# you are said the jeweller taking the #diamond# from his #hand# and the five and forty thousand #franc# inquired $m_caderousse$ in a hoarse #voice#
here they are replied the jeweller and he counted out upon the #table# #franc# in #gold# and #franc# in bank #note#
where are they come let us see them wait while i #light# the lamp said $la_carconte$
in #fact# #night# had come on during this #conversation# and with #night# the storm which had been threatening for the last #half# #hour#
the thunder growled in the #distance# but it was apparently not heard by the jeweller $m_caderousse$ or $la_carconte$ absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain
i myself felt a strange kind of fascination at the #sight# of all this #gold# and all these bank #note# it seemed to me that i was in a #dream# and as it always happens in a #dream# i felt myself riveted to the #spot#
$m_caderousse$ counted and again counted the #gold# and the #note# then handed them to his #wife# who counted and counted them again in her #turn#
during this #time# the jeweller made the #diamond# play and sparkle in the lamplight and the gem threw out jets of #light# which made him unmindful of those which precursors of the storm
it is growing dark and there may be some mistake began to play in at the #window# well inquired the jeweller
is the cash all #right# yes said $m_caderousse$ give me the #pocket# book $la_carconte$ and find a bag somewhere
from the former she took some greasy #letter# and put in their #place# the bank #note# and from the bag took two or three crowns of six livres each which in all probability formed the entire #fortune# of the miserable couple
$la_carconte$ went to a cupboard and returned with an old leathern #pocket# book and a bag there said $m_caderousse$
and now although you have wronged us of perhaps #franc# #will# you have your supper with us i invite you with good #will#
#thank# you replied the jeweller it must be getting late and i must #return# to beaucaire my #wife# #will# be getting uneasy
he drew out his watch and exclaimed morbleu nearly nine clock why i shall not get back to beaucaire before midnight
good #night# my #friend# if the $abbé_busoni$ should by any accident #return# think of me in another week you #will# have left beaucaire remarked $m_caderousse$
for the fair #end# in a few #day# true but that makes no difference write to me at paris to joannes in the palais royal arcade pierre no
at this #moment# there was a tremendous clap of thunder accompanied by a flash of lightning so vivid that it quite eclipsed the #light# of the lamp
i #will# make the journey on #purpose# to see him if it is worth while see here exclaimed $m_caderousse$
you cannot think of going out in such weather as this oh i am not afraid of thunder said the jeweller
and then there are robbers said $la_carconte$ the #road# is never very safe during fair #time#
oh as to the robbers said joannes here is #something# for them and he drew from his #pocket# a pair of small #pistol# loaded to the muzzle
are dogs who bark and bite at the same #time# they are for the two first who shall have a longing for your #diamond# #friend# $m_caderousse$
here said he $m_caderousse$ and his #wife# again interchanged a meaning #look# it seemed as though they were both inspired at the same #time# with some horrible #thought#
well then a good journey to you said $m_caderousse$ #thank# replied the jeweller he then took his cane which he had placed against an old cupboard and went out
at the #moment# when he opened the #door# such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was nearly extinguished
oh said he this is very nice weather and two leagues to go in such a storm
remain said $m_caderousse$ you can sleep here yes do stay added $la_carconte$ in a tremulous #voice#
we #will# take every #care# of you no i must sleep at beaucaire so once more good #night#
$m_caderousse$ followed him slowly to the threshold i can see neither heaven nor #earth# said the jeweller who was outside the #door#
do i #turn# to the #right# or to the left #hand# to the #right# said $m_caderousse$ you cannot go wrong
the #road# is bordered by #tree# on both #side# good all #right# said a #voice# almost lost in the #distance#
close the #door# said $la_carconte$ i do not like open #door# when it thunders particularly when there is #money# in the $house_of_peers$ eh
he came into the #room# went to the cupboard took out the bag and #pocket# book and both began for the third #time# to #count# their #gold# and bank #note#
answered $m_caderousse$ double locking the #door# i never saw such an #expression# of cupidity as the flickering lamp revealed in those two #countenance#
the #woman# especially was hideous her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified her #countenance# had become livid and her #eye# resembled burning coals
why she inquired in a hoarse #voice# did you invite him to sleep here tonight why said $m_caderousse$ with a shudder
why that he might not have the trouble of returning to beaucaire ah responded the #woman# with an #expression# impossible to describe
i #thought# it was for #something# else #woman# #woman# why do you have such #idea# cried $m_caderousse$
or if you have them why dont you keep them to yourself well said $la_carconte$ after a #moment# pause
you are not a #man# what do you #mean# added $m_caderousse$ if you had been a #man# you would not have let him go from here
#woman# or else he should not have reached beaucaire #woman# the #road# takes a #turn#
he is obliged to follow it while alongside of the canal there is a shorter #road# #woman# you offend the good god
and at this #moment# there was a tremendous peal of thunder while the livid lightning illumined the #room# and the thunder rolling away in the #distance# seemed to withdraw unwillingly from the cursed abode
at the same #moment# and in the midst of the terrifying #silence# which usually follows a clap of thunder they heard a knocking at the #door#
there listen mercy said $m_caderousse$ crossing himself $m_caderousse$ and his #wife# started and looked aghast at each #other#
cried $m_caderousse$ rising and #drawing# up in a heap the #gold# and #note# scattered over the #table# and which he covered with his two #hand#
who there it is i shouted a #voice# and who are you eh $pardieu$
joannes the jeweller well and you said i offended the good god said $la_carconte$ with a horrid #smile#
$la_carconte$ on the #contrary# rose and going with a firm #step# towards the #door# opened it saying as she did so
why the good god sends him back again $m_caderousse$ sank pale and breathless into his #chair# come in dear joannes
ma foi said the jeweller drenched with rain i am not destined to #return# to beaucaire tonight
the shortest follies are best my dear $m_caderousse$ you offered me hospitality and i accept it and have returned to sleep beneath your friendly roof
$m_caderousse$ stammered out #something# while he wiped away the sweat that started to his #brow# $la_carconte$ double locked the #door# behind the jeweller
#chapter# the rain of #blood# as the jeweller returned to the #apartment# he cast around him a scrutinizing #glance#
but there was #nothing# to excite suspicion if it did not exist or to confirm it if it were already awakened
$m_caderousse$ #hand# still grasped the #gold# and bank #note# and $la_carconte$ called up her sweetest #smile# while welcoming the reappearance of their #guest#
you seem my good #friend# to have had some #fear# respecting the accuracy of your #money# by counting it over so carefully directly i was gone
that was not my #reason# i can assure you but the #circumstance# by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so unexpected as to make us scarcely credit our good #fortune# and it is only by placing the actual #proof# of our riches before our #eye# that we can persuade ourselves that the whole #affair# is not a #dream#
well well said the jeweller oh no answered $m_caderousse$ the jeweller smiled
have you any #other# #guest# in your $house_of_peers$ inquired he nobody but ourselves replied $m_caderousse$ the #fact# is we do not lodge #traveller#
indeed our tavern is so near the town that nobody would think of stopping here then i am afraid i shall very much inconvenience you
inconvenience us not at all my dear #sir# said $la_carconte$ in her most gracious #manner# not at all i assure you
but where #will# you manage to stow me in the #chamber# overhead
surely that is where you yourselves sleep never #mind# that we have a second #bed# in the adjoining #room#
$m_caderousse$ stared at his #wife# with much #astonishment# the jeweller meanwhile was humming a song as he stood warming his back at the #fire#
$la_carconte$ had kindled to dry the wet garments of her #guest# and this done she next occupied herself in arranging his supper by spreading a napkin at the #end# of the #table# and placing on it the slender remains of their #dinner# to which she added three or four fresh laid eggs
the banknotes were replaced in the #pocket# book the #gold# put back into the bag and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard
he then began pacing the #room# with a pensive and gloomy #air# glancing from #time# to #time# at the jeweller who stood reeking with the steam from his wet clothes and merely changing his #place# on the warm hearth to enable the whole of his garments to be dried
$m_caderousse$ had once more parted with his #treasure# there said $la_carconte$ as she placed a bottle of wine on the #table#
supper is ready whenever you are and you asked joannes i dont want any supper said $m_caderousse$
we dined so very late hastily interposed $la_carconte$ then it seems i am to eat alone remarked the jeweller
oh we shall have the #pleasure# of waiting upon you answered $la_carconte$ with an eager #attention# she was not accustomed to manifest even to #guest# who paid for what they took
from #time# to #time# $m_caderousse$ darted on his #wife# keen searching #glance# but rapid as the lightning flash the storm still continued
there there said $la_carconte$ do you hear that upon my #word# you did well to come back
nevertheless replied the jeweller if by the #time# i have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated i shall make another start
it the mistral said $m_caderousse$ and it #will# be sure to last till #tomorrow# #morning# he sighed heavily
well said the jeweller as he placed himself at #table# all i can say is so much the worse for those who are abroad
the jeweller began eating his supper and the #woman# who was ordinarily so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her was suddenly transformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess
had the unhappy #man# on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with her so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his #mind# or at least have greatly astonished him
$m_caderousse$ meanwhile continued to pace the #room# in gloomy #silence# sedulously avoiding the #sight# of his #guest# but as soon as the #stranger# had completed his repast the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the #door# and opened it
yes chimed in $la_carconte$ they #will# have a wretched #night# of it i believe the storm is over said he
but as if to contradict his statement at that #instant# a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the $house_of_peers$ to its very foundation while a sudden gust of wind mingled with rain extinguished the lamp he held in his #hand#
trembling and awe struck $m_caderousse$ hastily shut the #door# and returned to his #guest# while $la_carconte$ lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes that glimmered on the hearth
you must be tired said she to the jeweller i have spread a pair of white sheets on your #bed# go up when you are ready and sleep well
joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in its fury but a brief space of #time# sufficed to assure him that instead of diminishing the violence of the rain and thunder momentarily increased resigning himself therefore to what seemed inevitable he bade his host good #night# and mounted the stairs
the quick eager #glance# of $la_carconte$ followed him as he ascended while $m_caderousse$ on the #contrary# turned his back and seemed most anxiously to avoid even glancing at him
all these #circumstance# did not strike me as painfully at the #time# as they have since done in #fact# all that had happened with the exception of the #story# of the #diamond# which certainly did wear an #air# of improbability appeared natural enough and called for neither apprehension nor mistrust but worn out as i was with fatigue and fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated i determined to obtain a few #hour# sleep
overhead i could accurately distinguish every movement of the jeweller who after making the best arrangements in his #power# for passing a comfortable #night# threw himself on his #bed# and i could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight
insensibly my eyelids grew heavy deep sleep stole over me and having no suspicion of #anything# wrong i sought not to shake it off
i looked into the kitchen once more and saw $m_caderousse$ sitting by the #side# of a long #table# upon #one# of the low wooden stools which in #country# #place# are frequently used instead of #chair# his back was turned towards me so that i could not see the #expression# of his #countenance# neither
should i have been able to do so had he been placed differently as his #head# was buried between his two #hand#
$la_carconte$ continued to gaze on him for some #time# then shrugging her #shoulder# she took her #seat# immediately opposite to him
at this #moment# the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling of a #piece# of wood that lay near and a bright #light# flashed over the #room#
$la_carconte$ still kept her #eye# fixed on her #husband# but as he made no #sign# of changing his #position# she extended her hard bony #hand# and touched him on the #forehead#
he passed over my #head# and i heard the flooring creak beneath his footsteps m
the #woman# #lip# seemed to move as though she were talking but because she merely spoke in an undertone or my senses were dulled by sleep i did not catch a #word# she uttered
$m_caderousse$ shuddered confused #sight# and #sound# seemed to float before me and gradually i fell into a deep heavy slumber how long i had been in this unconscious state
weak and tottering footsteps resounded across the #chamber# above me and the next #instant# a dull heavy weight seemed to fall powerless on the #staircase#
i had not yet fully recovered consciousness when again i heard groans mingled with #half# stifled #cry# as if from #person# engaged in a deadly struggle
a #cry# more prolonged than the #other# and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my drowsy lethargy
hastily raising myself on #one# #arm# i looked around but all was dark and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated through the flooring of the #room# above for some kind of moisture appeared to fall drop by drop upon my #forehead# and when i passed my #hand# across my #brow# i felt that it was wet and clammy
to the fearful #noise# that had awakened me had succeeded the most perfect #silence# unbroken save by the footsteps of a #man# walking about in the #chamber# above
i know not when i was suddenly aroused by the report of a #pistol# followed by a fearful #cry# the #staircase# creaked he descended into the #room# below approached the #fire# and lit a candle
the #man# was $m_caderousse$ he was pale and his shirt was all bloody having obtained the #light# he hurried upstairs again and once more i heard his rapid and uneasy footsteps
a #moment# later he came down again holding in his #hand# the small shagreen #case# which he opened to assure himself it contained the #diamond# seemed to hesitate as to which #pocket# he should put it in then
as if dissatisfied with the security of either #pocket# he deposited it in his red handkerchief which he carefully rolled round his #head#
after this he took from his cupboard the bank #note# and #gold# he had put there thrust the #one# into the #pocket# of his trousers and the #other# into that of his waistcoat hastily tied up a small bundle of linen and rushing towards the #door# disappeared in the #darkness# of the #night#
then all became clear and manifest to me and i reproached myself with what had happened as though i myself had done the guilty deed
i fancied that i still heard faint moans and imagining that the unfortunate jeweller might not be quite dead i determined to go to his relief by #way# of atoning in some slight degree not for the #crime# i had committed but for that which i had not endeavored to prevent
for this #purpose# i applied all the #strength# i possessed to force an entrance from the cramped #spot# in which i lay to the adjoining #room#
the poorly fastened #board# which alone divided me from it yielded to my #effort# and i found myself in the $house_of_peers$
hastily snatching up the lighted candle i hurried to the #staircase# about midway a #body# was lying quite across the stairs
the shot had frightfully lacerated her throat leaving two gaping wounds from which as well as the mouth the #blood# was pouring in floods
it was that of $la_carconte$ the #pistol# i had heard had doubtless been fired at her she was #stone# dead
the furniture had been knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken #place# there and the sheets to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung were dragged across the #room#
the murdered #man# lay on the #floor# his #head# leaning against the #wall# and about him was a pool of #blood# which poured forth from three large wounds in his breast there was a fourth gash in which a long #table# knife was plunged up to the handle
i strode past her and ascended to the sleeping #chamber# which presented an #appearance# of the wildest disorder i stumbled over some object i stooped to examine
i approached the jeweller who was not quite dead and at the #sound# of my footsteps and the creaking of the #floor# he opened his #eye# fixed them on me with an anxious and inquiring gaze moved his #lip# as though trying to speak then overcome by the #effort# fell back and expired
this appalling #sight# almost bereft me of my senses and finding that i could no longer be of #service# to #anyone# in the $house_of_peers$ my only #desire# was to fly
it was the second #pistol# which had not gone off probably from the powder being wet i rushed towards the #staircase# clutching my #hair# and uttering a groan of horror
upon reaching the #room# below i found five or six custom $house_of_peers$ #officer# and two or three gendarmes all heavily armed
they threw themselves upon me i made no resistance i was no longer #master# of my senses when i strove to speak a few inarticulate #sound# alone escaped my #lip#
as i noticed the significant #manner# in which the whole party pointed to my #blood# stained garments i involuntarily surveyed myself and then i discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as i lay beneath the #staircase# must have been the #blood# of $la_carconte$
i pointed to the #spot# where i had concealed myself what does he #mean# asked a gendarme
he #mean# replied the #man# upon his #return# that he got in that #way# and he showed the hole i had made when i broke through
#one# of the #officer# went to the #place# i directed then i saw that they took me for the assassin
i recovered force and energy enough to free myself from the #hand# of those who held me while i managed to stammer forth
i did not do it indeed indeed i did not a couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my breast
stir but a #step# said they and you are a dead #man# why should you threaten me with #death# cried i
when i have already declared my innocence tush tush cried the #man# keep your innocent #story# to tell to the judge at nîmes
meanwhile come along with us and the best advice we can give you is to do so unresistingly alas resistance was far from my #thought#
i was utterly overpowered by surprise and #terror# and without a #word# i suffered myself to be handcuffed and tied to a #horse# tail and thus they took me to nîmes
i had been tracked by a customs #officer# who had lost #sight# of me near the tavern #feeling# certain that i intended to pass the #night# there he had returned to summon his comrades who just arrived in #time# to hear the report of the #pistol# and to take me in the midst of such circumstantial #proof# of my guilt as rendered all #hope# of proving my innocence utterly futile
#one# only #chance# was left me that of beseeching the #magistrate# before whom i was taken to cause every inquiry to be made for the $abbé_busoni$ who had stopped at the inn of the pont du gard on that #morning#
if $m_caderousse$ had invented the #story# relative to the #diamond# and there existed no such #person# as the $abbé_busoni$ then indeed i was lost past redemption or at least my #life# hung upon the feeble #chance# of $m_caderousse$ himself being apprehended and confessing the whole #truth#
two #month# passed away in hopeless expectation on my #part# while i must do the #magistrate# the #justice# to say that he used every #mean# to obtain information of the #person# i declared could exculpate me if he would
my trial was to come on at the approaching assizes when on the th of september that is to say precisely three #month# and five #day# after the #event# which had perilled my #life#
the $abbé_busoni$ whom i never ventured to believe i should see presented himself at the #prison# #door# saying he understood #one# of the #prisoner# wished to speak to him he added that having learned at marseilles the particulars of my imprisonment he hastened to comply with my #desire#
you may easily imagine with what eagerness i welcomed him and how minutely i related the whole of what i had seen and heard
i felt some degree of nervousness as i entered upon the history of the #diamond# but to my inexpressible #astonishment# he confirmed it in every particular and to my equal surprise he seemed to #place# entire belief in all i said
$m_caderousse$ still evaded all pursuit and i had resigned myself to what seemed my inevitable fate
and then it was that won by his mild charity seeing that he was acquainted with all the habits and customs of my own #country# and considering also that pardon for the only #crime# of which i was really guilty might come with a double #power# from #lip# so benevolent and kind
i besought him to receive my confession under the seal of which i recounted the $auteuil$ #affair# in all its details as well as every #other# transaction of my #life#
that which i had done by the impulse of my best #feeling# produced the same #effect# as though it had been the result of calculation
my voluntary confession of the assassination at $auteuil$ proved to him that i had not committed that of which i stood accused
when he quitted me he bade me be of good courage and to rely upon his doing all in his #power# to convince my judges of my innocence
i had speedy #proof# that the excellent #abbé# was engaged in my behalf for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling though acceptable indulgences and i was told that my trial was to be postponed to the assizes following those now being held
in the interim it pleased providence to cause the apprehension of $m_caderousse$ who was discovered in some distant #country# and brought back to france where he made a full confession refusing to make the #fact# of his #wife# having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt
the wretched #man# was sentenced to the galleys for #life# and i was immediately set at #liberty#
and then it was i presume said $m_de_monte_cristo$ that you came to me as the bearer of a #letter# from the $abbé_busoni$
your mode of #life# as a smuggler said he to me #one# #day# #will# be the ruin of you if you get out dont take it up again
it was your #excellency# the benevolent #abbé# took an evident #interest# in all that concerned me
but how inquired i am i to maintain myself and my poor sister a #person# whose confessor i am replied he
and who entertains a high regard for me applied to me a short #time# since to procure him a confidential #servant#
would you like such a post if so i #will# give you a #letter# of introduction to him
oh #father# i exclaimed you are very good but you must swear solemnly that i shall never have #reason# to repent my recommendation
i extended my #hand# and was about to pledge myself by any #promise# he would dictate but he stopped me
it is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow said he i know and admire the corsican #nature# too well to #fear# you
here take this continued he after rapidly writing the few #line# i brought to your #excellency# and upon receipt of which you deigned to receive me into your #service# and proudly i ask whether your #excellency# has ever had cause to repent having done so
i take #pleasure# in saying that you have served me faithfully $m_bertuccio$ but you might have shown more confidence in me
no replied the #count# i your #excellency# yes you how comes it that having both a sister and an adopted #son# you have never spoken to me of either
anxious as you may suppose i was to behold and comfort my dear sister i lost no #time# in hastening to corsica but when i arrived at rogliano i found a $house_of_peers$ of mourning the consequences of a #scene# so horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this #day#
acting by my advice my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable demands of $m_benedetto$ who was continually tormenting her for #money# as long as he believed there was a sou left in her #possession#
#one# #morning# he threatened her with the severest consequences if she did not supply him with what he desired and disappeared and remained away all #day# leaving the kind hearted $assunta$ who loved him as if he were her own #child# to weep over his conduct and bewail his absence
alas i have still to recount the most distressing period of my #life# #evening# came and still with all the patient solicitude of a #mother# she watched for his #return#
as the eleventh #hour# struck he entered with a swaggering #air# attended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon #companion#
she stretched out her #arm# to him but they seized hold of her and #one# of the three none #other# than the accursed $m_benedetto$ exclaimed
it unfortunately happened that our neighbor wasilio was at bastia leaving no #person# in his $house_of_peers$ but his #wife# no human creature beside could hear or see #anything# that took #place# within our dwelling
two held poor $assunta$ who unable to conceive that any harm was intended to her smiled in the #face# of those who were soon to become her executioners
the third proceeded to barricade the #door# and #window# then returned and the three united in stifling the #cry# of #terror# incited by the #sight# of these preparations and then dragged $assunta$ #foot# foremost towards the brazier expecting to wring from her an avowal of where her supposed #treasure# was secreted
in the struggle her clothes caught #fire# and they were obliged to let go their hold in #order# to preserve themselves from sharing the same fate
covered with flames $assunta$ rushed wildly to the #door# but it was fastened she flew to the #window# but they were also secured then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks it was $assunta$ calling for help
the #cry# died away in groans and next #morning# as soon as wasilio #wife# could muster up courage to venture abroad she caused the #door# of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities when $assunta$ although dreadfully burnt was found still breathing every drawer and closet in the $house_of_peers$ had been forced open and the #money# stolen
put her to torture and she ll soon tell us where her #money# is $m_benedetto$ never again appeared at rogliano neither have i since that #day# either seen or heard #anything# concerning him
it was subsequently to these dreadful #event# that i waited on your #excellency# to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned $m_benedetto$ since all trace of him seemed entirely lost or of my sister since she was dead
and in what #light# did you view the occurrence inquired $m_de_monte_cristo$ as a punishment for the #crime# i had committed answered $m_bertuccio$
oh those villeforts are an accursed race truly they are murmured the #count# in a lugubrious #tone#
your #excellency# may perhaps be able to comprehend that this #place# which i revisit for the first #time# this #garden# the actual #scene# of my #crime# must have given rise to reflections of no very agreeable #nature# and produced that gloom and depression of spirits which excited the notice of your #excellency# who was pleased to express a #desire# to know the cause
at this #instant# a shudder passes over me as i reflect that possibly i am now standing on the very grave in which lies $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ by whose #hand# the #ground# was dug to receive the corpse of his #child#
and now resumed $m_bertuccio$ #everything# is possible said $m_de_monte_cristo$ rising from the bench on which he had been sitting
the $abbé_busoni$ did #right# to send you to me he went on in his ordinary #tone# and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your history as it #will# prevent my forming any erroneous #opinion# concerning you in future
as for that $m_benedetto$ who so grossly belied his #name# have you never made any #effort# to trace out whither he has gone or what has become of him
no far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself i should shun the possibility of meeting him as i would a wild beast
even he added in an inaudible #voice# even that the #procureur# be not dead #thank# god i have never heard his #name# mentioned by any #person# and i #hope# and believe he is dead
$m_bertuccio$ replied the #count# for the wicked are not so easily disposed of for god seems to have them under his special watch #care# to make of them instruments of his vengeance
do not think so so be it responded $m_bertuccio$ all i ask of heaven is that i may never see him again
and now your #excellency# he added bowing his #head# you know #everything# you are my judge on #earth# as the almighty is in heaven have you for me no #word# of consolation
my good #friend# i can only repeat the #word# addressed to you by the $abbé_busoni$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ merited punishment for what he had done to you and perhaps to #other#
$m_benedetto$ if still living #will# become the instrument of divine retribution in some #way# or #other# and then be duly punished in his #turn#
as far as you yourself are concerned i see but #one# #point# in which you are really guilty ask yourself wherefore after rescuing the infant from its living grave you did not restore it to its #mother#
there was the #crime# $m_bertuccio$ that was where you became really culpable true #excellency# that was the #crime# the real #crime# for in that i acted like a coward
my first #duty# directly i had succeeded in recalling the babe to #life# was to restore it to its #mother# but in #order# to do so i must have made close and careful inquiry which would in all probability have led to my own apprehension and i clung to #life# partly on my sister #account# and partly from that #feeling# of pride inborn in our #heart# of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the execution of our vengeance
perhaps too the natural and instinctive #love# of #life# made me #wish# to avoid endangering my own and then again i am not as brave and courageous as was my poor #brother#
$m_bertuccio$ hid his #face# in his #hand# as he uttered these #word# while $m_de_monte_cristo$ fixed on him a #look# of inscrutable meaning
after a brief #silence# rendered still more solemn by the #time# and #place# the #count# said in a #tone# of melancholy wholly unlike his usual #manner#
in #order# to bring this #conversation# to a fitting termination the last we shall ever hold upon this #subject# i #will# repeat to you some #word# i have heard from the #lip# of the $abbé_busoni$
for all evils there are two remedies #time# and #silence# and now leave me $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_bertuccio$ to walk alone here in the #garden#
the very #circumstance# which inflict on you as a principal in the tragic #scene# enacted here such painful #emotion# are to me on the #contrary# a source of #something# like contentment and serve but to enhance the value of this dwelling in my estimation
the chief beauty of #tree# consists in the deep #shadow# of their umbrageous boughs while fancy pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade
here i have a #garden# laid out in such a #way# as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination and furnished with thickly grown #tree# beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at #will#
this to me who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight #wall# is i assure you a most agreeable surprise
i have no #fear# of ghosts and i have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand #year# as is wrought by the living in a single #day#
should your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying #moment# than you found the $abbé_busoni$ send for me if i am still on #earth# and i #will# soothe your ears with #word# that shall effectually calm and soothe your parting soul
retire within $m_bertuccio$ and tranquillize your #mind# ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity $m_bertuccio$ bowed respectfully and turned away sighing heavily
$m_de_monte_cristo$ left alone took three or four #step# onwards and murmured here beneath this plane #tree# must have been where the infant grave was dug
there is the little #door# #opening# into the #garden# at this #corner# is the private #staircase# communicating with the sleeping #apartment#
there #will# be no necessity for me to make a #note# of these particulars for there before my #eye# beneath my #foot# all around me i have the #plan# sketched with all the living reality of #truth#
after making the tour of the #garden# a second #time# the #count# re entered his #carriage# while $m_bertuccio$ who perceived the thoughtful #expression# of his #master# #feature# took his #seat# beside the driver without uttering a #word#
that same #evening# upon reaching his abode in the champs élysées the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ went over the whole building with the #air# of #one# long acquainted with each nook or #corner#
nor although preceding the party did he once mistake #one# #door# for another or commit the smallest error when choosing any particular corridor or #staircase# to conduct him to a #place# or suite of #room# he desired to #visit#
having given various #order# to $m_bertuccio$ relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to make in the $house_of_peers$ the #count# #drawing# out his watch said to the attentive nubian
the #carriage# proceeded rapidly towards paris $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ was his principal attendant during this nocturnal survey it is #half# past eleven clock $haydée$ #will# soon be here
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ extended his #hand# towards the #apartment# destined for the fair greek which were so effectually concealed by #mean# of a tapestried entrance that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined their existence
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ having pointed to the #apartment# held up three #finger# of his #right# #hand# and then placing it beneath his #head# shut his #eye# and feigned to sleep
have the french attendants been summoned to await her coming i understand said $m_de_monte_cristo$ well acquainted with $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ pantomime
you #mean# to tell me that three female attendants await their new mistress in her sleeping #chamber# $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ with considerable animation made a #sign# in the affirmative
#madame# #will# be tired tonight continued $m_de_monte_cristo$ and #will# no #doubt# #wish# to #rest# #desire# the french attendants not to weary her with #question# but merely to pay their respectful #duty# and retire
you #will# also see that the greek #servant# hold no communication with those of this #country# he bowed just at that #moment# #voice# were heard hailing the concierge
the #count# hastily descended presented himself at the already opened #carriage# #door# and held out his #hand# to a young #woman# completely enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily embroidered with #gold#
the #gate# opened a #carriage# rolled down the avenue and stopped at the #step# she raised the #hand# extended towards her to her #lip# and kissed it with a mixture of #love# and respect
some few #word# passed between them in that sonorous language in which homer makes his gods converse the young #woman# spoke with an #expression# of deep tenderness while the #count# replied with an #air# of gentle gravity
preceded by $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ who carried a rose colored flambeau in his #hand# the young #lady# who was no #other# than the lovely greek who had been $m_de_monte_cristo$ #companion# in italy was conducted to her #apartment# while the #count# retired to the pavilion reserved for himself
in another #hour# every #light# in the $house_of_peers$ was extinguished and it might have been #thought# that all its inmates slept
the following #day# a calash drawn by a pair of magnificent english #horse# stopped at the #door# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ and a #person# dressed in a blue coat with buttons of a similar color a white waistcoat over which was displayed a massive #gold# chain brown trousers and a quantity of black #hair# descending so low over his eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether it were not artificial so little
a #person# in a #word# who although evidently past fifty desired to be taken for not more than forty bent forwards from the #carriage# #door# on the panels of which were emblazoned the armorial bearings of a #baron# and directed his groom to inquire at the porter lodge whether the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ resided there and if he were within
while waiting the occupant of the #carriage# surveyed the $house_of_peers$ the #garden# as far as he could distinguish it and the livery of #servant# who passed to and fro with an #attention# so close as to be somewhat impertinent
his #glance# was keen but showed cunning rather than intelligence his #lip# were straight and so thin that as they closed they were drawn in over the teeth his cheek bones were broad and projecting a never failing #proof# of audacity and craftiness while the flatness of his #forehead# and the enlargement of the back of his skull which rose much higher than his large and coarsely shaped ears combined to form a physiognomy #anything# but prepossessing save in the #eye# of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable more especially when they gazed on the enormous #diamond# that glittered in his shirt and the red ribbon that depended from his button hole
the groom in obedience to his #order# tapped at the #window# of the porter lodge saying pray does not the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ live here
#chapter# unlimited credit about two clock did its jetty glossiness assimilate with the deep wrinkles stamped on his #feature#
his #excellency# does reside here replied the concierge but added he glancing an inquiring #look# at $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ ali returned a #sign# in the negative
but what asked the groom his #excellency# does not receive visitors #today# then here is my #master#
you #will# take it to the #count# and say that although in haste to attend the #chamber# my #master# came out of his #way# to have the #honor# of calling upon him
card the #baron# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i never speak to his #excellency# replied the concierge the #valet# de chambre #will# carry your message
the groom returned to the #carriage# well asked $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ the #man# somewhat crest fallen by the rebuke he had received repeated what the concierge had said
bless me murmured #baron# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ this must surely be a prince instead of a #count# by their styling him
however it does not signify he has a #letter# of credit on me so i must see him when he requires his #money#
then throwing himself back in his #carriage# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ called out to his coachman in a #voice# that might be heard across the #road#
#excellency# and only venturing to address him by the medium of his #valet# de chambre to the #chamber# of deputies
apprised in #time# of the #visit# paid him $m_de_monte_cristo$ had from behind the blinds of his pavilion as minutely observed the #baron# by #mean# of an excellent lorgnette as $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ himself had scrutinized the $house_of_peers$ #garden# and #servant#
that #fellow# has a decidedly bad #countenance# said the #count# in a #tone# of disgust as he shut up his #glass# into its ivory #case#
how comes it that all do not retreat in aversion at #sight# of that flat receding serpent like #forehead# round vulture shaped #head# and sharp hooked nose like the beak of a buzzard
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ cried he striking at the same #time# on the brazen gong $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ appeared summon $m_bertuccio$ said the #count#
almost immediately $m_bertuccio$ entered the #apartment# did your #excellency# #desire# to see me inquired he i did replied the #count#
you no #doubt# observed the #horse# standing a few #minute# since at the #door# certainly your #excellency# i noticed them for their remarkable beauty
that when i desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of #horse# to be found in paris there is another pair fully as fine as mine not in my stables
at the #look# of displeasure added to the angry #tone# in which the #count# spoke $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ turned pale and held down his #head#
it is not your fault my good $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ said the #count# in the arabic language and with a gentleness none would have #thought# him capable of showing either in #voice# or #face# it is not your fault
then how comes it said $m_de_monte_cristo$ with a frown you do not understand the #point# of english #horse#
permit me to assure your #excellency# said $m_bertuccio$ that the #horse# you speak of were not to be sold when i purchased yours
it seems #sir# steward said he that you have yet to learn that all #thing# are to be sold to such as #care# to pay the price
the #countenance# of poor $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ recovered its serenity $m_de_monte_cristo$ shrugged his #shoulder# his #excellency# is not perhaps aware that $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ gave #franc# for his #horse#
very well then offer him double that #sum# a #banker# never loses an opportunity of doubling his capital
$m_de_monte_cristo$ regarded the #person# who durst presume to #doubt# his #word# with the #look# of #one# equally surprised and displeased
is your #excellency# really in earnest inquired the steward i have to pay a #visit# this #evening# replied he
i #desire# that these #horse# with completely new harness may be at the #door# with my #carriage# $m_bertuccio$ bowed and was about to retire but when he reached the #door# he paused and then said
at what clock does your #excellency# #wish# the #carriage# and #horse# to be ready at five clock replied the #count#
i beg your #excellency# pardon interposed the steward in a deprecating #manner# for venturing to observe that it is already two clock
then turning towards $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ he said let all the #horse# in my stables be led before the #window# of your young #lady# that she may select those she prefers for her #carriage#
request her also to oblige me by saying whether it is her #pleasure# to dine with me if so let #dinner# be served in her #apartment#
i am perfectly aware of that #fact# answered $m_de_monte_cristo$ calmly now leave me and #desire# my #valet# de chambre to come hither
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ $monsieur_baptistin$ said the #count# you have been in my #service# #one# #year# the #time# i generally give myself to judge of the merits or demerits of those about me
scarcely had $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ disappeared when the #valet# entered the #chamber# you suit me very well $monsieur_baptistin$ bowed low
it only remains for me to know whether i also suit you oh your #excellency# exclaimed $monsieur_baptistin$ eagerly
you receive #franc# per annum for your #service# here more than many a brave subaltern who continually risks his #life# for his #country# obtains
you live in a #manner# far superior to many clerks who #work# ten #time# harder than you do for their #money#
then though yourself a #servant# you have #other# #servant# to wait upon you take #care# of your clothes and see that your linen is duly prepared for you
again you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my toilet amounting in the #course# of a #year# to a #sum# equalling your wages
listen if you please till i have finished speaking replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ nay indeed your #excellency#
it would be long indeed ere you would find so lucrative a post as that you have now the good #fortune# to fill
i am not condemning you for this $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $monsieur_baptistin$ but let your profits #end# here i neither ill #use# nor ill treat my #servant# by #word# or action
my commands are ordinarily short clear and precise and i would rather be obliged to repeat my #word# twice or even three #time# than they should be misunderstood
i am rich enough to know whatever i #desire# to know and i can #promise# you i am not wanting in curiosity
if then i should learn that you had taken upon yourself to speak of me to #anyone# favorably or unfavorably to comment on my actions or watch my conduct that very #instant# you would quit my #service#
an error i readily forgive but wilful negligence or forgetfulness never you may now retire i never caution my #servant# a second #time#
i forgot to mention to you said the #count# that i lay yearly aside a certain #sum# for each #servant# in my establishment those whom i am compelled to dismiss lose as a #matter# of #course# all participation in this #money# while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those domestics who remain with me and among whom it #will# be divided at my #death#
remember that $monsieur_baptistin$ bowed and was proceeding towards the #door# you have been in my #service# a #year# your fund has already begun to accumulate
this address delivered in the #presence# of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ who not understanding #one# #word# of the language in which it was spoken stood wholly unmoved produced an #effect# on $monsieur_baptistin$ only to be conceived by such as have occasion to #study# the character and disposition of french domestics
i assure your #excellency# said he that at least it shall be my #study# to merit your approbation in all #thing# and i #will# take $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ as my model
let it continue to do so by no #mean# replied the #count# in the most frigid #tone#
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities he cannot possibly serve you as a pattern for your conduct not being as you are a paid #servant# but
a mere slave a dog who should he fail in his #duty# towards me i should not discharge from my #service# but kill
you seem incredulous said $m_de_monte_cristo$ who repeated to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ in the arabic language what he had just been saying to $monsieur_baptistin$ in french
$monsieur_baptistin$ opened his #eye# with #astonishment# the nubian smiled assentingly to his #master# #word# then kneeling on #one# knee respectfully kissed the #hand# of the #count#
this corroboration of the lesson he had just received put the finishing stroke to the wonder and stupefaction of $monsieur_baptistin$
the #count# then motioned the #valet# de chambre to retire and to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ to follow to his #study# where they conversed long and earnestly together
as the #hand# of the clock pointed to five the #count# struck thrice upon his gong when $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ was wanted #one# stroke was given two summoned $monsieur_baptistin$ and three $m_bertuccio$
the steward entered my #horse# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ they are at the #door# harnessed to the #carriage# as your #excellency# desired
the #count# descended to the #door# of his mansion and beheld his #carriage# drawn by the very pair of #horse# he had so much admired in the #morning# as the property of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
does your #excellency# #wish# me to accompany him no the coachman $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and $monsieur_baptistin$ #will# go as he passed them he said
they are extremely handsome certainly and you have done well to purchase them although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner
indeed your #excellency# i had very considerable difficulty in obtaining them and as it is they have cost an enormous price
does the #sum# you gave for them make the animals less beautiful inquired the #count# shrugging his #shoulder#
nay if your #excellency# is satisfied it is all that i could #wish# whither does your #excellency# #desire# to be driven
this #conversation# had passed as they stood upon the terrace from which a flight of #stone# #step# led to the #carriage# drive
to the residence of #baron# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ rue de la chaussée antin as $m_bertuccio$ with a respectful bow was moving away the #count# called him back
i have another commission for you $m_bertuccio$ said he i am desirous of having an estate by the seaside in normandy for instance between le havre and boulogne
it #will# be absolutely necessary that the #place# you may select have a small harbor creek or bay into which my corvette can enter and remain at anchor
you see i give you a wide range she draws only fifteen #foot# she must be kept in constant readiness to sail immediately
make the requisite inquiries for a #place# of this description and when you have met with an eligible #spot# #visit# it and if it possess the advantages desired purchase it at once in your own #name#
i think proper to give the signal the corvette must now i think be on her #way# to fécamp must she not
certainly your #excellency# i saw her put to #sea# the same #evening# we quitted marseilles and the yacht
i #wish# you to write from #time# to #time# to the #captain# in charge of the two #vessel# so as to keep them on the alert
was ordered to remain at martigues tis well and the steamboat she is at châlons
yes the same #order# for her as for the two sailing #vessel# very good
when you have purchased the estate i #desire# i want constant relays of #horse# at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern #road#
the #count# made a gesture of satisfaction descended the terrace #step# and sprang into his #carriage# which was whirled along swiftly to the #banker#
your #excellency# may depend upon me $house_of_peers$ $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was engaged at that #moment# presiding over a railroad committee
as the #count# title sounded on his ear he rose and addressing his colleagues who were members of #one# or the #other# #chamber# he said
#gentleman# pardon me for leaving you so abruptly but a most ridiculous #circumstance# has occurred which is this $thomson_french_of_rome$ the roman #banker# have sent to me a certain #person# calling himself the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ and have given him an unlimited credit with me
i confess this is the drollest #thing# i have ever met with in the #course# of my extensive foreign transactions and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity
i took the trouble this #morning# to call on the pretended #count# if he were a real #count# he wouldnt be so rich
but the meeting was nearly concluded when the #name# of his visitor was announced but would you believe it he was not receiving
i made inquiries and found that the $house_of_peers$ in the champs élysées is his own property and certainly it was very decently kept up
but pursued $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with #one# of his sinister #smile# an #order# for unlimited credit calls for #something# like caution on the #part# of the #banker# to whom that #order# is given
so the #master# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ gives himself #air# befitting a great millionaire or a capricious beauty i am very anxious to see this #man#
i suspect a hoax is intended but the instigators of it little knew whom they had to deal with they laugh best who laugh last
having delivered himself of this pompous address uttered with a degree of energy that left the #baron# almost out of breath he bowed to the assembled party and withdrew to his #drawing# #room# whose sumptuous furnishings of white and #gold# had caused a great sensation in the chaussée antin
it was to this #apartment# he had desired his #guest# to be shown with the #purpose# of overwhelming him at the #sight# of so much luxury
he found the #count# standing before some copies of albano and fattore that had been passed off to the #banker# as originals but which mere copies as they were seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition with the gaudy colors that covered the ceiling
with a slight inclination of the #head# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ signed to the #count# to be seated pointing significantly to a gilded armchair covered with white satin embroidered with #gold#
the #count# turned round as he heard the entrance of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ into the #room# the #count# sat down
i have the #honor# i presume of addressing de $m_de_monte_cristo$ the #count# bowed and i of speaking to #baron# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ chevalier of the legion of #honor# and member of the #chamber# of deputies
$m_de_monte_cristo$ repeated all the titles he had read on the #baron# card $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ felt the irony and compressed his #lip#
you #will# i trust excuse me $monsieur_cavalcanti$ for not calling you by your title when i first addressed you he said
but you are aware that we are living under a popular form of government and that i am myself a representative of the #liberty# of the #people#
so much so replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ that while you call yourself #baron# you are not willing to call anybody else #count#
i attach no #sort# of value to such empty distinctions but the #fact# is i was made #baron# and also chevalier of the legion of #honor# in #return# for #service# rendered but
upon my #word# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with affected carelessness but you have discarded your titles after the example set you by messrs de montmorency and lafayette
that was a noble example to follow $monsieur_cavalcanti$ why replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ not entirely so with the #servant# you understand
i see to your domestics you are my lord the journalists style you $monsieur_cavalcanti$ while your constituents call you citizen
again $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ bit his #lip# he saw that he was no match for $m_de_monte_cristo$ in an argument of this #sort# and he therefore hastened to #turn# to #subject# more congenial
permit me to inform you #count# said he bowing that i have received a #letter# of advice from $thomson_french_of_rome$
these are distinctions very suitable under a constitutional government i understand perfectly i am glad to hear it #baron# for
i have acquired the bad habit of calling #person# by their titles from living in a #country# where #baron# are still #baron# by #right# of birth
but as regards the #letter# of advice i am charmed to find that it has reached you that #will# spare me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for #money# myself
i must claim the privilege of addressing you after the #manner# of your #servant# you have received a regular #letter# of advice
yes said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ but i confess i didnt quite comprehend its meaning indeed and for that #reason# i did myself the #honor# of calling upon you in #order# to beg for an explanation
go on $monsieur_cavalcanti$ here i am ready to give you any explanation you #desire# why said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ in the #letter#
i believe i have it about me here he felt in his breast #pocket# yes here it is well this #letter# gives the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ unlimited credit on our $house_of_peers$
well #baron# what is there difficult to understand about that merely the term unlimited #nothing# else certainly
oh as for the composition of the #letter# there is #nothing# to be said but as regards the competency of the document i certainly have #doubt#
is not that #word# known in france the #people# who wrote are anglo germans you know is it possible
asked the #count# assuming all #air# and #tone# of the utmost simplicity and candor is it possible that $thomson_french_of_rome$ are not looked upon as safe and solvent #banker#
pray tell me what you think #baron# for i feel uneasy i can assure you having some considerable property in their #hand#
$thomson_french_of_rome$ are perfectly solvent replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with an almost mocking #smile# but the #word# unlimited in financial #affair# is so extremely vague
is in #fact# unlimited said $m_de_monte_cristo$ precisely what i was about to say cried $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ now what is vague is doubtful and it was a wise #man# who said when in #doubt# keep out
meaning to say rejoined $m_de_monte_cristo$ that however $thomson_french_of_rome$ may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and folly the #baron# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is not disposed to follow their example
plainly enough messrs $thomson_french_of_rome$ set no bounds to their engagements while those of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ have their limits he is a wise #man# according to his own showing
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ replied the #banker# #drawing# himself up with a haughty #air# the extent of my resources has never yet been questioned
not at all it seems then reserved for me said $m_de_monte_cristo$ coldly to be the first to do so
by what #right# #sir# by #right# of the objections you have raised and the explanations you have demanded which certainly must have some motive
once more $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ bit his #lip# it was the second #time# he had been worsted and this #time# on his own #ground#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ on the #contrary# preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor aided by a certain degree of simplicity he could assume at #pleasure# and thus possessed the advantage
his forced politeness sat awkwardly upon him and approached almost to impertinence well #sir# resumed $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ after a brief #silence#
i #will# endeavor to make myself understood by requesting you to inform me for what #sum# you propose to draw upon me
why truly replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ determined not to lose an inch of the #ground# he had gained my #reason# for desiring an unlimited credit was precisely because i did not know how much #money# i might need
the #banker# #thought# the #time# had come for him to take the upper #hand# so throwing himself back in his armchair he said with an arrogant and purse proud #air#
let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your #wish# you #will# then be convinced that the resources of the $house_of_peers$ of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ however limited are still equal to meeting the largest demands and were you even to require a #million#
i beg your pardon interposed $m_de_monte_cristo$ i said a #million# replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with the confidence of ignorance
my dear #sir# if a trifle like that could suffice me i should never have given myself the trouble of #opening# an #account#
excuse my smiling when you speak of a #sum# i am in the habit of carrying in my #pocket# book or dressing #case#
and with these #word# $m_de_monte_cristo$ took from his #pocket# a small #case# containing his visiting cards and drew forth two #order# on the treasury for #franc# each payable at #sight# to the bearer
but could i do with a #million# retorted the #count# a #million# a #man# like $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was wholly inaccessible to any gentler method of correction
the #effect# of the present revelation was stunning he trembled and was on the verge of apoplexy the pupils of his #eye# as he gazed at $m_de_monte_cristo$ dilated horribly
i understand and foreseeing that such might be the #case# i took in #spite# of my ignorance of #affair# certain precautions
come come said $m_de_monte_cristo$ confess honestly that you have not perfect confidence in $thomson_french_of_rome$ see here are two similar #letter# to that
#one# from the $house_of_peers$ of arstein eskeles of vienna to #baron# rothschild the #other# drawn by baring of london upon lafitte
now #sir# you have but to say the #word# and i #will# spare you all uneasiness by presenting my #letter# of credit to #one# or #other# of these two firms
the blow had struck home and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was entirely vanquished with a trembling #hand# he took the two #letter# from the #count# who held them carelessly between #finger# and thumb and proceeded to scrutinize the signatures with a minuteness that the #count# might have regarded as insulting had it not suited his present #purpose# to mislead the #banker#
oh #sir# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ after he had convinced himself of the authenticity of the documents he held and rising as if to salute the #power# of #gold# personified in the #man# before him three #letter# of unlimited credit
i can be no longer mistrustful but you must pardon me my dear #count# for confessing to some degree of #astonishment#
you have yourself received nay answered $m_de_monte_cristo$ with the most gentlemanly #air# tis not for such trifling #sum# as these that your banking $house_of_peers$ is to be incommoded
then you can let me have some #money# can you not whatever you say my dear #count# i am at your #order#
why replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ since we mutually understand each #other# for such i presume is the #case# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ bowed assentingly
you are quite sure that not a lurking #doubt# or suspicion lingers in your #mind# oh my dear #count# exclaimed $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
no you merely wished to be convinced #nothing# more but now that we have come to so clear an understanding and that all distrust and suspicion are laid at #rest# we may as well fix a #sum# as the probable expenditure of the first #year# suppose we say six #million# to
i never for an #instant# entertained such a #feeling# towards you six #million# gasped $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ so be it
then if i should require more continued $m_de_monte_cristo$ in a careless #manner# why of #course# i should draw upon you but my present intention is not to remain in france more than a #year# and during that period i scarcely think i shall exceed the #sum# i mentioned
however we shall see be kind enough then to send me #franc# #tomorrow# i shall be at home till midday or if not i #will# leave a receipt with my steward
the #money# you #desire# shall be at your $house_of_peers$ by ten clock #tomorrow# #morning# my dear #count# replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
how would you like to have it in #gold# silver or #note# #half# in #gold# and the #other# #half# in bank #note# if you please said the #count# rising from his #seat#
i must confess to you #count# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ that i have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great #fortune# of europe and
still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown to me may i presume to ask whether you have long possessed it
a #sort# of #treasure# expressly forbidden to be touched for a certain period of #year# during which the accumulated #interest# has doubled the capital
the period appointed by the testator for the disposal of these riches occurred only a short #time# ago and they have only been employed by me within the last few #year#
it has been in the #family# a very long while returned $m_de_monte_cristo$ your ignorance on the #subject# therefore is easily accounted for
and the #count# while pronouncing these latter #word# accompanied them with #one# of those ghastly #smile# that used to strike #terror# into poor $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay
with your tastes and #mean# of gratifying them continued $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ you #will# exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us poor miserable millionaires quite in the shade
if i mistake not you are an admirer of paintings at least i judged so from the #attention# you appeared to be bestowing on mine when i entered the #room#
if you #will# permit me i shall be happy to show you my picture gallery composed entirely of #work# by the ancient #master# warranted as such
however you #will# be better informed as to me and my #possession# ere long not a modern picture among them
you are perfectly #right# in objecting to them for this #one# great fault that they have not yet had #time# to become old
i cannot endure the modern school of painting or #will# you allow me to show you several fine statues by thorwaldsen bartoloni and canova all
foreign artists for as you may perceive i think but very indifferently of our french sculptors you have a #right# to be unjust to them $monsieur_cavalcanti$ they are your compatriots
but all this may come later when we shall be better known to each #other# for the present i #will# confine myself if perfectly agreeable to you to introducing you to the #baroness# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
$m_de_monte_cristo$ bowed in #sign# that he accepted the proffered #honor# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ rang and was answered by a #servant# in a showy livery
excuse my impatience my dear #count# but a client like you is almost like a member of the #family#
is the #baroness# at home inquired $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ yes my lord answered the #man# and alone no my lord #madame# has visitors
have you any objection to meet any #person# who may be with #madame# or do you #desire# to preserve a strict incognito
no indeed replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ with a #smile# i do not arrogate to myself the #right# of so doing
inquired $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with an #air# of indulgence and good #nature# that made $m_de_monte_cristo$ #smile# acquainted as he was with the #secret# of the #banker# domestic #life#
and who is with #madame# $m_lucien_debray$ yes my lord replied the #servant# $m_lucien_debray$ is with #madame#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ nodded his #head# then turning to $m_de_monte_cristo$ said $m_lucien_debray$ is an old #friend# of ours and private secretary to the #minister# of the interior
as for my #wife# i must tell you she lowered herself by marrying me for she belongs to #one# of the most ancient #family# in france
her maiden #name# was de servières and her first #husband# was colonel the marquis of nargonne i have not the #honor# of knowing #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ but i have already met $m_lucien_debray$
ah indeed said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and where was that at the $house_of_peers$ of de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ ah
you are acquainted with the young viscount are you we were together a good deal during the carnival at rome
let me see have i not heard talk of some strange adventure with #bandit# or thieves hid in ruins and of his having had a miraculous escape
i forget how but i know he used to amuse my #wife# and #daughter# by telling them about it after his #return# from italy
her ladyship is waiting to receive you #gentleman# said the #servant# who had gone to inquire the #pleasure# of his mistress
true true cried $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with your permission said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ bowing i #will# precede you to show you the #way#
the #baron# followed by the #count# traversed a long series of #apartment# in which the prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of ostentatious wealth until he reached the boudoir of #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
by all #mean# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ i follow you #chapter# the dappled grays a small octagonal shaped #room# hung with pink satin covered with white indian muslin
the #chair# were of ancient workmanship and materials over the #door# were painted sketches of shepherds and shepherdesses after the style and #manner# of boucher and at each #side# pretty medallions in crayons harmonizing well with the furnishings of this charming #apartment# the only #one# throughout the great mansion in which any distinctive taste prevailed
the #truth# was it had been entirely overlooked in the #plan# arranged and followed out by $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and his architect who had been selected to aid the #baron# in the great #work# of improvement solely because he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the #day#
m $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ however while possessing a great admiration for the antique as it was understood during the #time# of the directory entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance of his #wife# favorite sitting #room# where by the #way# he was never permitted to intrude unless indeed he excused his own #appearance# by ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself and even then he had rather the #air# and #manner# of a #person# who was himself introduced than that of being the presenter of another his reception being cordial or frigid in proportion as the #person# who accompanied him chanced to please or displease the #baroness#
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who although past the first bloom of youth was still strikingly handsome was now seated at the piano a most elaborate #piece# of cabinet and inlaid #work# while $m_lucien_debray$ standing before a small #work# #table# was turning over the pages of an album
the decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and $m_lucien_debray$ $m_lucien_debray$ had found #time# preparatory to the #count# arrival to relate many particulars respecting him to #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
it #will# be remembered that $m_de_monte_cristo$ had made a lively impression on the #mind# of all the party assembled at the breakfast given by $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and although $m_lucien_debray$ was not in the habit of yielding to such #feeling# he had never been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his #mind# by the impressive #look# and #manner# of the #count# consequently the description given by $m_lucien_debray$ to the #baroness# bore the highly colored tinge of his own heated imagination
already excited by the wonderful #story# related of the #count# by de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ it is no wonder that #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ eagerly listened to and fully credited all the additional #circumstance# detailed by $m_lucien_debray$
a most gracious welcome and unusual #smile# were bestowed on $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ the #count# in #return# for his gentlemanly bow received a formal though graceful courtesy while $m_lucien_debray$ exchanged with the #count# a #sort# of distant recognition and with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ a free and easy nod
#baroness# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ give me leave to present to you the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ who has been most warmly recommended to me by my correspondents at rome
i need but mention #one# #fact# to make all the #lady# in paris #court# his notice and that is that he has come to take up his abode in paris for a #year# during which brief period he proposes to spend six #million# of #money#
that #mean# balls #dinner# and lawn parties without #end# in all of which i trust the #count# #will# remember us as he may depend upon it we shall him in our own humble entertainments
this posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by #way# of precaution
in #spite# of the gross flattery and coarseness of this address #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ could not forbear gazing with considerable #interest# on a #man# capable of expending six #million# in twelve #month# and who had selected paris for the #scene# of his princely extravagance
and when did you arrive here inquired she #yesterday# #morning# #madame# coming as usual i presume from the extreme #end# of the globe
pardon me at least such i have heard is your custom nay #madame# this #time# i have merely come from cadiz
you have selected a most unfavorable #moment# for your first #visit# paris is a horrible #place# in summer balls parties and fêtes are over the italian opera is in london the french opera everywhere except in paris
as for the théatre français you know of #course# that it is nowhere the only amusements left us are the indifferent races at the champ de mars and satory
i shall do whatever they do at paris #madame# if i have the good #fortune# to find someone who #will# initiate me into the prevalent #idea# of amusement
do you propose entering any #horse# at either of these races #count# are you fond of #horse# #count#
i have passed a considerable #part# of my #life# in the east #madame# and you are doubtless aware that the orientals value only two #thing# the fine breeding of their #horse# and the beauty of their #woman#
nay #count# said the #baroness# it would have been somewhat more gallant to have placed the #lady# first
you see #madame# how rightly i spoke when i said i required a preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here
at this #instant# the favorite attendant of #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ entered the boudoir approaching her mistress she spoke some #word# in an undertone
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ turned very pale then exclaimed i cannot believe it the #thing# is impossible
i assure you #madame# replied the #woman# it is as i have said turning impatiently towards her #husband# #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ demanded is this true
is what true #madame# inquired $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ visibly agitated what my maid tells me but what does she tell you
that when my coachman was about to harness the #horse# to my #carriage# he discovered that they had been removed from the stables without his knowledge
i #desire# to know what is the meaning of this be kind enough #madame# to listen to me said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
oh yes i #will# listen $monsieur_cavalcanti$ for i am most curious to hear what explanation you #will# give these two #gentleman# shall decide between us but first i #will# state the #case# to them
#gentleman# continued the #baroness# among the ten #horse# in the stables of #baron# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ are two that belong exclusively to me
but to you at least $m_lucien_debray$ i need not give a further description because to you my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known
well i had promised #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the loan of my #carriage# to drive #tomorrow# to the bois but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they are gone positively gone
a pair of the handsomest and most spirited creatures to be found in paris no #doubt# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ has sacrificed them to the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry #franc#
#madame# replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ the #horse# were not sufficiently quiet for you they were scarcely four #year# old and they made me extremely uneasy on your #account#
nonsense retorted the #baroness# you could not have entertained any alarm on the #subject# because you are perfectly well aware that i have had for a #month# in my #service# the very best coachman in paris
oh what a detestable crew they are these mercenary speculators but perhaps you have disposed of the coachman as well as the #horse#
my dear #love# pray do not say any more about them and i #promise# you another pair exactly like them in #appearance# only more quiet and steady
the #baroness# shrugged her #shoulder# with an #air# of ineffable contempt while her #husband# affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture turned towards $m_de_monte_cristo$ and said upon my #word# #count# i am quite sorry not to have met you sooner
you are setting up an establishment of #course# why yes replied the #count# i should have liked to have made you the offer of these #horse#
i have almost given them away as it is but as i before said i was anxious to get rid of them upon any terms
they were only fit for a young #man# i am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me said $m_de_monte_cristo$
but this #morning# i purchased a very excellent pair of #carriage# #horse# and i do not think they were dear there they are
come $m_lucien_debray$ you are a connoisseur i believe let me have your #opinion# upon them as $m_lucien_debray$ walked towards the #window# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ approached his #wife#
i could not tell you before #other# said he in a low #tone# the #reason# of my parting with the #horse# but a most enormous price was offered me this #morning# for them
some madman or fool bent upon ruining himself as fast as he can actually sent his steward to me to purchase them at any cost and the #fact# is i have gained #franc# by the sale of them
come dont #look# so angry and you shall have #franc# of the #money# to do what you like with and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ shall have
there what do you think now of the #affair# wasnt i #right# to #part# with the #horse# #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ surveyed her #husband# with a #look# of withering contempt
great heavens suddenly exclaimed $m_lucien_debray$ what is it asked the #baroness# i cannot be mistaken there are your #horse#
the very animals we were speaking of harnessed to the #count# #carriage# my dappled grays demanded the #baroness# springing to the #window#
tis indeed they said she $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ looked absolutely stupefied how very singular cried $m_de_monte_cristo$ with well feigned #astonishment#
i cannot believe it murmured the #banker# #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ whispered a few #word# in the ear of $m_lucien_debray$ who approached $m_de_monte_cristo$ saying
the #baroness# #wish# to know what you paid her #husband# for the #horse# i scarcely know replied the #count#
it was a little surprise prepared for me by my steward and cost me well somewhere about #franc# $m_lucien_debray$ conveyed the #count# reply to the #baroness#
poor $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ looked so crest fallen and discomfited that $m_de_monte_cristo$ assumed a pitying #air# towards him see said the #count# how very ungrateful #woman# are
your kind #attention# in providing for the safety of the #baroness# by disposing of the #horse# does not seem to have made the least impression on her
but so it is a #woman# #will# often from mere wilfulness prefer that which is dangerous to that which is safe
therefore in my #opinion# my dear #baron# the best and easiest #way# is to leave them to their fancies and allow them to act as they please and then if any mischief follows why at least they have no #one# to blame but themselves
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ made no reply he was occupied in anticipations of the coming #scene# between himself and the #baroness# whose frowning #brow# like that of olympic jove predicted a storm
$m_lucien_debray$ who perceived the gathering clouds and felt no #desire# to witness the explosion of #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ rage suddenly recollected an appointment which compelled him to take his leave while $m_de_monte_cristo$ unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to obtain made a farewell bow and departed leaving $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to endure the angry reproaches of his #wife#
excellent murmured $m_de_monte_cristo$ to himself as he came away all has gone according to my #wish#
the domestic peace of this #family# is henceforth in my #hand# now then to play another #master# stroke by which i shall gain the #heart# of both #husband# and #wife#
still added he amid all this i have not yet been presented to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ whose acquaintance i should have been glad to make
delightful but he went on with his peculiar #smile# i am here in paris and have plenty of #time# before me by and by #will# do for that
two #hour# afterwards #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ received a most flattering epistle from the #count# in which he entreated her to receive back her favorite dappled grays protesting that he could not endure the #idea# of making his entry into the parisian #world# of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained at the price of a lovely #woman# regrets
the #horse# were sent back wearing the same harness she had seen on them in the #morning# only by the #count# #order# in the centre of each rosette that adorned either #side# of their #head# had been fastened a large #diamond#
to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_de_monte_cristo$ also wrote requesting him to excuse the whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire and to beg the #baroness# to pardon the eastern fashion adopted in the #return# of the #horse#
with these reflections he entered his #carriage# and returned home during the #evening# $m_de_monte_cristo$ quitted paris for $auteuil$ accompanied by $ali_pasha_of_yanina$
the following #day# about three clock a single blow struck on the gong summoned $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ to the #presence# of the #count#
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ observed his #master# as the nubian entered the #chamber# you have frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are in throwing the lasso have you not
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ drew himself up proudly and then returned a #sign# in the affirmative i #thought# i did not mistake
with your lasso you could stop an ox again $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ repeated his affirmative gesture or a tiger $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ bowed his #head# in token of assent
a lion even $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ sprung forwards imitating the action of #one# throwing the lasso then of a strangled lion
i understand said $m_de_monte_cristo$ you #wish# to tell me you have hunted the lion $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased and captured many lions
but do you believe you could arrest the progress of two #horse# rushing forwards with ungovernable fury the nubian smiled
ere long a #carriage# #will# dash past here drawn by the pair of dappled gray #horse# you saw me with #yesterday# now at the risk of your own #life# you must manage to stop those #horse# before my #door#
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ descended to the #street# and marked a straight #line# on the pavement immediately at the entrance of the $house_of_peers$ and then pointed out the #line# he had traced to the #count# who was watching him
the #count# patted him gently on the #shoulder# his usual mode of praising $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ who pleased and gratified with the commission assigned him walked calmly towards a projecting #stone# forming the angle of the #street# and $house_of_peers$ and seating himself thereon began to smoke his chibouque while $m_de_monte_cristo$ re entered his dwelling perfectly assured of the success of his #plan#
still as five clock approached and the #carriage# was momentarily expected by the #count# the indication of more than common impatience and uneasiness might be observed in his #manner#
he stationed himself in a #room# commanding a view of the #street# pacing the #chamber# with restless #step# stopping merely to listen from #time# to #time# for the #sound# of approaching wheels then to cast an anxious #glance# on $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ but the regularity with which the nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation
suddenly a distant #sound# of rapidly advancing wheels was heard and almost immediately a #carriage# appeared drawn by a pair of wild ungovernable #horse# while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their furious speed
it is well said $m_de_monte_cristo$ then listen to me in the vehicle was a young #woman# and a #child# of about seven or eight clasped in each #other# #arm#
the #carriage# creaked and rattled as it flew over the rough #stone# and the slightest obstacle under the wheels would have caused disaster but it kept on in the middle of the #road# and those who saw it pass uttered #cry# of #terror#
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ suddenly cast aside his chibouque drew the lasso from his #pocket# threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near #horse# in its triple fold and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few #step# by the violence of the shock then the animal fell over on the pole which snapped and therefore prevented the #other# #horse# from pursuing its #way#
gladly availing himself of this opportunity the coachman leaped from his #box# but $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ had promptly seized the nostrils of the second #horse# and held them in his #iron# grasp till the beast snorting with pain sunk beside his #companion#
#terror# seemed to have deprived them even of the #power# of uttering a #cry# all this was achieved in much less #time# than is occupied in the recital
the brief space had however been sufficient for a #man# followed by a number of #servant# to rush from the $house_of_peers$ before which the accident had occurred and as the coachman opened the #door# of the #carriage# to take from it a #lady# who was convulsively grasping the cushions with #one# #hand# while with the #other# she pressed to her bosom the young #boy# who had lost consciousness
$m_de_monte_cristo$ carried them both to the salon and deposited them on a sofa compose yourself #madame# said he all danger is over
the #woman# looked up at these #word# and with a #glance# far more expressive than any entreaties could have been pointed to her #child# who still continued insensible
but i assure you there is not the slightest occasion for uneasiness your little charge has not received the least injury his insensibility is merely the #effect# of #terror# and #will# soon pass
i understand the #nature# of your alarms #madame# said the #count# carefully examining the #child# are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my #fear#
see how deadly pale he is my #child# my darling $edward$ speak to your #mother# open your dear #eye# and #look# on me once again
oh #sir# in #pity# send for a physician my whole #fortune# shall not be #thought# too much for the recovery of my #boy#
with a calm #smile# and a gentle wave of the #hand# $m_de_monte_cristo$ signed to the distracted #mother# to lay aside her apprehensions then #opening# a casket that stood near he drew forth a phial of bohemian #glass# incrusted with #gold# containing a liquid of the color of #blood# of which he let fall a single drop on
scarcely had it reached them ere the #boy# though still pale as marble opened his #eye# and eagerly gazed around him
the #child# #lip# at this the delight of the #mother# was almost frantic where am i exclaimed she
#madame# answered the #count# you are under the roof of #one# who esteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you from a further continuance of your sufferings
and to whom am i indebted for so happy a termination to my late dreadful alarm my wretched curiosity has brought all this about pursued the #lady#
all paris rung with the praises of #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ beautiful #horse# and i had the folly to #desire# to know whether they really merited the high praise given to them
is it possible exclaimed the #count# with well feigned #astonishment# that these #horse# belong to the #baroness# they do indeed
i have that #honor# and my #happiness# at your escape from the danger that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that i have been the unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have incurred
i #yesterday# purchased these #horse# of the #baron# but as the #baroness# evidently regretted parting with them i ventured to send them back to her with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my #hand#
may i inquire if you are acquainted with #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ you are then doubtless the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ of whom $hermine$ has talked to me so much
you have rightly guessed #madame# replied the #count# and i am #madame# héloïse $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the #count# bowed with the #air# of a #person# who hears a #name# for the first #time#
how grateful #will# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ be for all your goodness how thankfully #will# he acknowledge that to you alone he owes the existence of his #wife# and #child#
most certainly but for the prompt assistance of your intrepid #servant# this dear #child# and myself must both have perished
indeed i still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in i trust you #will# allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of your #man#
i beseech you #madame# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ not to spoil $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ either by too great praise or rewards i cannot allow him to acquire the habit of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling #service# he may render
nay interposed #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ on whom the authoritative style adopted by the #count# made a deep impression nay but consider that to preserve my #life# he has risked his own
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ is my slave and in saving your #life# he was but discharging his #duty# to me
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ made no further reply her #mind# was utterly absorbed in the contemplation of the #person# who from the first #instant# she saw him had made so powerful an impression on her
during the evident preoccupation of #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ $m_de_monte_cristo$ scrutinized the #feature# and #appearance# of the #boy# she kept folded in her #arm# lavishing on him the most tender endearments
his #life# #madame# belongs not to him it is mine in #return# for my having myself saved him from #death# the #child# was small for his #age# and unnaturally pale
a mass of straight black #hair# defying all attempts to train or curl it fell over his projecting #forehead# and hung down to his #shoulder# giving increased vivacity to #eye# already sparkling with a youthful #love# of mischief and fondness for every forbidden enjoyment
his mouth was large and the #lip# which had not yet regained their color were particularly thin in #fact# the deep and crafty #look# giving a predominant #expression# to the #child# #face# belonged rather to a #boy# of twelve or fourteen than to #one# so young
his first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the encircling #arm# of his #mother# and to rush forward to the casket from whence the #count# had taken the phial of elixir then without asking permission of #anyone# he proceeded in all the wilfulness of a spoiled #child# unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices to pull the corks out of all the bottles
touch #nothing# my little #friend# cried the #count# eagerly some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste but even to inhale
#arm# drew him anxiously toward her but once satisfied of his safety she also cast a brief but expressive #glance# on the casket which was not lost upon the #count#
at #sight# of him #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ uttered an #expression# of #pleasure# and holding the #child# still closer towards her she said $edward$ dearest do you see that good #man#
he has shown very great courage and resolution for he exposed his own #life# to stop the #horse# that were running away with us and would certainly have dashed the #carriage# to #piece#
#thank# him then my #child# in your very best #manner# for had he not come to our aid neither you nor i would have been alive to speak our #thank#
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ became very pale and seizing her #son# at this #moment# $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ entered the #child# stuck out his #lip# and turned away his #head# in a disdainful #manner# saying
the #count# smiled as if the #child# bade fair to realize his #hope# while #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ reprimanded her #son# with a gentleness and moderation very far from conveying the least #idea# of a fault having been committed
this #lady# said the #count# speaking to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ in the arabic language is desirous that her #son# should #thank# you for saving both their #life# but the #boy# refuses saying you are too ugly
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ turned his intelligent #countenance# towards the #boy# on whom he gazed without any apparent #emotion# but the spasmodic working of the nostrils showed to the practiced #eye# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ that the arab had been wounded to the #heart#
#will# you permit me to inquire said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ as she arose to take her leave whether you usually reside here
he too ugly no i do not replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ it is a small #place# i have purchased quite lately
my #place# of abode is no avenue des champs élysées but i see you have quite recovered from your fright and are no #doubt# desirous of returning home
anticipating your #wish# i have desired the same #horse# you came with to be put to #one# of my #carriage# and $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ he whom you think so very ugly continued he addressing the #boy# with a smiling #air# #will# have the #honor# of driving you home while your coachman remains here to attend to the necessary repairs of your calash
as soon as that important #business# is concluded i #will# have a pair of my own #horse# harnessed to convey it direct to #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
i dare not #return# with those dreadful #horse# said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ you #will# see replied $m_de_monte_cristo$
that they #will# be as different as possible in the #hand# of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ with him they #will# be gentle and docile as lambs
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ had indeed given #proof# of this for approaching the animals who had been got upon their legs with considerable difficulty he rubbed their #forehead# and nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar and wiped off the sweat and foam that covered their mouths
then commencing a loud whistling #noise# he rubbed them well all over their #body# for several #minute# then undisturbed by the noisy crowd collected round the broken #carriage# $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ quietly harnessed the pacified animals to the #count# chariot took the reins in his #hand# and mounted the #box# when to the utter #astonishment# of those who had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same #horse# he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle #manner# before he could induce them to start and even then all that could be obtained from the celebrated dappled grays now changed into a couple of dull sluggish stupid brutes was a slow pottering pace kept up with so much difficulty that #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was more than two #hour# returning to her residence in the $faubourg_saint_honoré$
scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been gone through when she wrote the following #letter# to #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
dear $hermine$ i have just had a wonderful escape from the most imminent danger and i owe my safety to the very #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ we were talking about #yesterday# but whom i little expected to see #today#
i remember how unmercifully i laughed at what i considered your eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him but i have now ample cause to admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful #man# fell far short of his merits
your #horse# got as far as ranelagh when they darted forward like mad #thing# and galloped away at so fearful a rate that there seemed no #other# prospect for myself and my poor $edward$ but that of being dashed to #piece# against the first object that impeded their progress when a strange looking #man# an arab a negro or a nubian at least a black of some nation or #other# at a signal from the #count# whose domestic he is suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals even at the risk of being trampled to #death# himself and certainly he must have had a most wonderful escape
the #count# then hastened to us and took us into his $house_of_peers$ where he speedily recalled my poor $edward$ to #life#
you #will# find your #horse# in bad condition from the results of this accident they seem thoroughly stupefied as if sulky and vexed at having been conquered by #man#
the #count# however has commissioned me to assure you that two or three #day# #rest# with plenty of barley for their sole food during that #time# #will# bring them back to as fine
he sent us home in his own #carriage# yours #will# be returned to you #tomorrow# that is as terrifying a condition as they were in #yesterday#
i cannot #return# you many #thank# for the drive of #yesterday# but after all i ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your #horse# more especially as it procured me the #pleasure# of an introduction to the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ and certainly that illustrious personage apart from the #million# he is said to be so very anxious to dispose of seemed to me #one# of those curiously interesting problems i for #one# delight in solving at any risk even if it were to necessitate another drive to the bois behind your #horse#
he did not utter a single #cry# but fell lifeless into my #arm# nor did a #tear# fall from his #eye# after it was over
i #doubt# not you #will# consider these praises the result of blind maternal affection but there is a soul of #iron# in that delicate fragile #body#
adieu $edward$ endured the accident with miraculous courage $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ sends many affectionate remembrances to your dear $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i embrace you with all my #heart#
héloïse $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ s do pray contrive some #mean# for me to meet the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ at your $house_of_peers$ i must and #will# see him again
i have just made $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #promise# to call on him and i #hope# the #visit# #will# be returned that #night# the adventure at $auteuil$ was talked of everywhere
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ related it to his #mother# $baron_de_château_renaud$ recounted it at the jockey club and $m_lucien_debray$ detailed it at #length# in the salons of the #minister# even $m_beauchamp$ accorded twenty #line# in his journal to the relation of the #count# courage and gallantry thereby celebrating him as the greatest hero of the #day# in the #eye# of all the feminine members of the aristocracy
vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring #friend# who left their #name# at the residence of #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with the design of renewing their #visit# at the #right# #moment# of hearing from her #lip# all the interesting #circumstance# of this most romantic adventure
as for $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ he fulfilled the predictions of héloïse to the #letter# donned his dress suit drew on a pair of white gloves ordered the #servant# to attend the #carriage# dressed in their full livery and drove that same #night# to no in the avenue des champs élysées
if the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ had been for a long #time# familiar with the #way# of parisian society he would have appreciated better the significance of the #step# which $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had taken
standing well at #court# whether the #king# regnant was of the older or younger branch whether the government was doctrinaire liberal or conservative looked upon by all as a #man# of talent since those who have never experienced a political check are generally so regarded hated by many but warmly supported by #other# without being really liked by anybody $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ held a high #position# in the magistracy and maintained his eminence like a harlay or a molé
his #drawing# #room# under the regenerating influence of a young #wife# and a #daughter# by his first #marriage# scarcely eighteen was still #one# of the well regulated paris salons where the worship of traditional customs and the observance of rigid etiquette were carefully maintained
a freezing politeness a strict fidelity to government principles a profound contempt for theories and theorists a deep seated hatred of ideality these were the elements of private and public #life# displayed by $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
volume three m #chapter# ideology $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was not only a #magistrate# he was almost a diplomatist
his relations with the former #court# of which he always spoke with dignity and respect made him respected by the new #one# and he knew so many #thing# that not only was he always carefully considered but sometimes consulted
perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get rid of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ but like the feudal #baron# who rebelled against their sovereign he dwelt in an impregnable fortress
this fortress was his post as #king# attorney all the advantages of which he exploited with marvellous skill and which he would not have resigned but to be made deputy and thus to replace neutrality by opposition
his #wife# visited for him and this was the received #thing# in the #world# where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the #magistrate# were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride a manifestation of professed superiority in #fact# the application of the axiom pretend to think well of yourself and the #world# #will# think well of you an axiom a hundred #time# more useful in society nowadays than that of the greeks
know thyself a knowledge for which in our #day# we have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of knowing #other#
to his #friend# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was a powerful protector to his #enemy# he was a silent but bitter opponent for those who were neither the #one# nor the #other# he was a statue of the #law# made #man#
ordinarily $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ made and returned very few #visit# he had a haughty bearing a #look# either steady and impenetrable or insolently piercing and inquisitorial
four successive revolutions had built and cemented the pedestal upon which his #fortune# was based $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had the reputation of being the least curious and the least wearisome #man# in france
he gave a ball every #year# at which he appeared for a #quarter# of an #hour# only that is to say five and forty #minute# less than the #king# is visible at his balls
he was never seen at the theatres at concerts or in any #place# of public resort occasionally but seldom he played at whist and then #care# was taken to select partners worthy of him
sometimes they were ambassadors sometimes archbishops or sometimes a prince or a #president# or some dowager duchess such was the #man# whose #carriage# had just now stopped before the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ #door#
the #valet# de chambre announced $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ at the #moment# when the #count# leaning over a large #table# was tracing on a map the route from st petersburg to china
he was the same #man# or rather the development of the same #man# whom we have heretofore seen as assistant attorney at marseilles
the #procureur# entered with the same grave and measured #step# he would have employed in entering a #court# of #justice# #nature# according to her #way# had made no deviation in the path he had marked out for himself
from being slender he had now become meagre once pale he was now yellow his deep set #eye# were hollow and the #gold# spectacles shielding his #eye# seemed to be an integral portion of his #face#
he dressed entirely in black with the exception of his white tie and his funeral #appearance# was only mitigated by the slight #line# of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through his button hole and appeared like a streak of #blood# traced with a delicate brush
although #master# of himself $m_de_monte_cristo$ scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity the #magistrate# whose salute he returned and who distrustful by habit and especially incredulous as to social prodigies was much more despised to #look# upon
the noble #stranger# as $m_de_monte_cristo$ was already called as an adventurer in search of new fields or an escaped criminal rather than as a prince of the holy see or a sultan of the thousand and #one# #night#
#sir# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in the squeaky #tone# assumed by #magistrate# in their oratorical periods and of which they cannot or #will# not divest themselves in society #sir# the signal #service# which you #yesterday# rendered to my #wife# and #son# has made it a #duty# for me to offer you my #thank#
i have come therefore to discharge this #duty# and to express to you my overwhelming gratitude and as he said this the #eye# severe of the #magistrate# had lost #nothing# of its habitual arrogance
he spoke in a #voice# of the #procureur# general with the rigid inflexibility of neck and #shoulder# which caused his flatterers to say as we have before observed that he was the living statue of the #law#
i am very happy to have been the #mean# of preserving a #son# to his #mother# for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all and the good #fortune# which occurred to me $monsieur_cavalcanti$ might have enabled you to dispense with a #duty# which in its discharge confers an undoubtedly great #honor# for i am aware that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ is not usually lavish of the favor which he now bestows on me a favor which however estimable is unequal to the satisfaction which i have in my own consciousness
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ astonished at this reply which he by no #mean# expected started like a #soldier# who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor he wears and a curl of his disdainful #lip# indicated that from that #moment# he noted in the tablets of his brain that the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ was by no #mean# a highly bred #gentleman#
he glanced around in #order# to seize on #something# on which the #conversation# might #turn# and seemed to fall easily on a topic
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ replied the #count# with a chilling #air# he saw the map which $m_de_monte_cristo$ had been examining when he entered and said
it is a rich #study# for you who as i learn have seen as many lands as are delineated on this map
i have sought to make of the human race taken in the mass what you practice every #day# on individuals a physiological #study#
i have believed it was much easier to descend from the whole to a #part# than to ascend from a #part# to the whole
it is an algebraic axiom which makes us proceed from a known to an unknown quantity and not from an unknown to a known but sit down #sir# i beg of you
$m_de_monte_cristo$ pointed to a #chair# which the #procureur# was obliged to take the trouble to move forwards himself while the #count# merely fell back into his own on which he had been kneeling when $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ entered
thus the #count# was halfway turned towards his visitor having his back towards the #window# his elbow resting on the geographical chart which furnished the theme of #conversation# for the #moment# a #conversation# which assumed as in the #case# of the interviews with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ a #turn# analogous to the #person# if not to the situation
ah you philosophize replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ after a #moment# #silence# during which like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent he took breath
you seem geographically engaged #sir# yes #sir# replied the #count# well #sir# really if like you i had #nothing# else to do i should seek a more amusing occupation
#man# is but an ugly caterpillar for him who #study# him through a solar microscope but you said i think that i had #nothing# else to do
why in #truth# #sir# was $m_de_monte_cristo$ reply now really let me ask #sir# have you do you believe you have #anything# to do
or to speak in plain terms do you really think that what you do deserves being called #anything# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #astonishment# redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly made by his strange adversary
since the #magistrate# had heard a paradox so strong or rather to say the #truth# more exactly it was the first #time# he had ever heard of it
#sir# he responded you are a #stranger# and i believe you say yourself that a portion of your #life# has been spent in oriental #country# so you are not aware how human #justice# so expeditious in barbarous #country# takes with us a prudent and well studied #course#
it was a long #time# the #procureur# exerted himself to reply oh yes yes i do #sir# it is the pede claudo of the ancients
it is with the criminal procedure of all nations that i have compared natural #justice# and i must say #sir# that it is the #law# of primitive nations that is the #law# of retaliation that i have most frequently found to be according to the #law# of god
i know all that for it is with the #justice# of all #country# especially that i have occupied myself
it would greatly simplify our legal codes and in that #case# the #magistrate# would not as you just observed have much to do
if this #law# were adopted #sir# said the #procureur# it may perhaps come to this in #time# observed $m_de_monte_cristo$
in the meanwhile continued the #magistrate# our codes are in full force with all their contradictory enactments derived from gallic customs roman #law# and frank usages the knowledge of all which you #will# agree is not to be acquired without extended labor it needs tedious #study# to acquire this knowledge and when acquired a strong #power# of brain to retain it
you know that human inventions march from the complex to the simple and simplicity is always perfection
i agree with you entirely #sir# but all that even you know with respect to the french code i know not only in reference to that code but as regards the codes of all nations
the english turkish japanese hindu #law# are as familiar to me as the french #law# and thus i was #right# when i said to you that relatively you know that #everything# is relative
#sir# that relatively to what i have done you have very little to do but that relatively to all i have learned you have yet a great deal to learn
but with what motive have you learned all this inquired $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in #astonishment# $m_de_monte_cristo$ smiled
i see that in #spite# of the reputation which you have acquired as a superior #man# you #look# at #everything# from the material and vulgar view of society beginning with #man# and ending with #man# that is to say in the most restricted most narrow view which it is possible for human understanding to embrace
really #sir# he observed pray #sir# explain yourself said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ more and more astonished i really do not understand you perfectly
i say #sir# that with the #eye# fixed on the social organization of nations you see only the springs of the machine and lose #sight# of the sublime workman who makes them act i say that you do not recognize before you and around you any but those office holders whose commissions have been signed by a #minister# or #king# and that the #man# whom god has put above those office holders #minister# and #king# by giving them a mission to follow out instead of a post to fill
i say that they escape your narrow limited field of observation it is thus that human weakness fails from its debilitated and imperfect organs
the nations took attila who was doomed to destroy them for a conqueror similar to #other# conquerors and it was necessary for both to reveal their missions that they might be known and acknowledged #one# was compelled to say
tobias took the angel who restored him to #light# for an ordinary young #man# i am the angel of the lord and the #other#
then said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ more and more amazed and really supposing he was speaking to a mystic or a madman you consider yourself as #one# of those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned
i am the hammer of god in #order# that the divine essence in both might be revealed
your pardon #sir# replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ quite astounded but you #will# excuse me if when i presented myself to you i was unaware that i should meet with a #person# whose knowledge and understanding so far surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of #man#
it is not usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find #gentleman# like yourself possessors as you are of immense #fortune# at least so it is said
and why not said $m_de_monte_cristo$ coldly and i beg you to observe that i do not inquire
i merely repeat it is not usual i say for such privileged and wealthy beings to waste their #time# in speculations on the state of society in philosophical reveries intended at best to console those whom fate has disinherited from the goods of this #world#
really #sir# retorted the #count# have you attained the eminent situation in which you are without having admitted or even without having met with exceptions
and do you never #use# your #eye# which must have acquired so much finesse and certainty to divine at a #glance# the kind of #man# by whom you are confronted
should not a #magistrate# be not merely the best administrator of the #law# but the most crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession a steel probe to search #heart# a touchstone to try the #gold# which in each soul is mingled with more or less of alloy
#sir# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ upon my #word# you overcome me i really never heard a #person# speak as you do
because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general conditions and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper spheres which god has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings
and you allow then #sir# that spheres exist and that these marked and invisible beings mingle amongst us
why should they not can you see the #air# you breathe and yet without which you could not for a #moment# exist
then we do not see those beings to whom you allude yes we do you see them whenever god pleases to allow them to assume a material form
you touch them come in contact with them speak to them and they reply to you ah said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ smiling
i confess i should like to be warned when #one# of these beings is in contact with me
you have been served as you #desire# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ for you were warned just now and i now again warn you
then you yourself are #one# of these marked beings yes $monsieur_cavalcanti$ i believe so for until now no #man# has found himself in a #position# similar to mine
the dominions of #king# are limited either by mountains or rivers or a change of #manner# or an alteration of language
my kingdom is bounded only by the #world# for i am not an italian or a frenchman or a hindu or an american or a spaniard
i am a cosmopolite no #country# can say it saw my birth god alone knows what #country# #will# see me die
i adopt all customs speak all languages you believe me to be a frenchman for i speak french with the same facility and purity as yourself
well $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ my nubian believes me to be an arab $m_bertuccio$ my steward takes me for a roman $haydée$ my slave thinks me a greek
that being of no #country# asking no protection from any government acknowledging no #man# as my #brother# not #one# of the scruples that arrest the powerful or the obstacles which paralyze the weak paralyzes or arrests me
you may therefore comprehend i have only two adversaries i #will# not say two conquerors for with perseverance i subdue even them they are #time# and #distance#
this alone can stop me in my onward career before i have attained the goal at which i aim for all the #rest# i have reduced to mathematical terms
there is a third and the most terrible that is my condition as a mortal being what #man# call the #chance# of fate namely ruin change #circumstance#
unless i die i shall always be what i am and therefore it is that i utter the #thing# you have never heard even from the mouths of #king# for #king# have need and #other# #person# have #fear# of you
i have fully anticipated and if any of these should overtake me yet it #will# not overwhelm me for who is there who does not say to himself in a society as incongruously organized as ours
perhaps some #day# i shall have to do with the #king# attorney but can you not say that #sir#
the #moment# you become an inhabitant of france you are naturally subjected to the french #law# i know it #sir# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$
but when i #visit# a #country# i begin to #study# by all the #mean# which are available the #man# from whom i may have #anything# to #hope# or to #fear# till i know them as well as perhaps better than they know themselves
it follows from this that the #king# attorney be he who he may with whom i should have to deal would assuredly be more embarrassed than i should
that is to say replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with hesitation that human #nature# being weak every #man# according to your creed has committed faults
faults or #crime# responded $m_de_monte_cristo$ with a negligent #air# and that you alone amongst the #man# whom you do not recognize as your #brother# for you have said so
observed $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in a #tone# that faltered somewhat you alone are perfect no not perfect was the #count# reply
but let us leave off this strain #sir# if the #tone# of it is displeasing to you i am no more disturbed by your #justice# than are you by my second #sight#
only impenetrable that all no no by no #mean# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who was afraid of seeming to abandon his #ground#
no by your brilliant and almost sublime #conversation# you have elevated me above the ordinary level we no longer talk we rise to dissertation
but you know how the theologians in their collegiate #chair# and philosophers in their controversies occasionally say cruel #truth# let us suppose for the #moment# that we are theologizing in a social #way# or even philosophically and i #will# say to you rude as it may seem
my #brother# you sacrifice greatly to pride you may be above #other# but above you there is god
above us all #sir# was $m_de_monte_cristo$ response in a #tone# and with an emphasis so deep that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ involuntarily shuddered
i have my pride for #man# serpents always ready to threaten #everyone# who would pass without crushing them under #foot#
but i lay aside that pride before god who has taken me from #nothing# to make me what i am
then #count# i admire you said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who for the first #time# in this strange #conversation# used the aristocratic form to the unknown personage whom until now he had only called $monsieur_cavalcanti$
yes and i say to you if you are really strong really superior really pious or impenetrable which you were #right# in saying amounts to the same #thing#
then be proud #sir# for that is the characteristic of predominance yet you have unquestionably some ambition
i too as happens to every #man# once in his #life# have been taken by satan into the highest mountain in the #earth# and when there he showed me all the kingdoms of the #world# and as he said before so said he to me #child# of #earth# what wouldst thou have to make thee adore me
i have #sir# and what may it be i reflected long for a gnawing ambition had long preyed upon me and then i replied
listen i have always heard of providence and yet i have never seen him or #anything# that resembles him or which can make me believe that he exists
i #wish# to be providence myself for i feel that the most beautiful noblest most sublime #thing# in the #world# is to recompense and punish
you mistake he said providence does exist only you have never seen him because the #child# of god is as invisible as the parent
satan bowed his #head# and groaned you have seen #nothing# that resembles him because he #work# by #secret# springs and moves by hidden #way#
all i can do for you is to make you #one# of the agents of that providence the bargain was concluded
i may sacrifice my soul but what #matter# it added $m_de_monte_cristo$ if the #thing# were to do again i would again do it
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looked at $m_de_monte_cristo$ with extreme amazement #count# he inquired have you any relations no #sir# i am alone in the #world#
so much the worse why asked $m_de_monte_cristo$ because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down your pride
i did not say that i feared it i only said that #death# alone could check the execution of my #plan#
you say you #fear# #nothing# but #death# and old #age# my #end# #will# be achieved before i grow old
and madness i have been nearly mad and you know the axiom non bis in idem
it is an axiom of criminal #law# and consequently you understand its full application #sir# continued $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ there is #something# to #fear# besides #death# old #age# and madness
for instance there is apoplexy that lightning stroke which strikes but does not destroy you and yet which brings #everything# to an #end#
you are still yourself as now and yet you are yourself no longer you who like ariel verge on the angelic are but an inert mass which like caliban verges on the brutal and this is called in human tongues as i tell you neither more nor less than apoplexy
come if so you #will# #count# and continue this #conversation# at my $house_of_peers$ any #day# you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you and i #will# show you my #father# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #one# of the most fiery jacobins of the french revolution that is to say he had the most remarkable audacity seconded by a most powerful organization a #man# who has not perhaps like yourself seen all the kingdoms of the #earth# but who has helped to overturn #one# of the greatest in #fact# a #man# who believed himself like you #one# of the envoys not of god but of a supreme being not of providence but of fate
well #sir# the rupture of a #blood# #vessel# on the lobe of the brain has destroyed all this not in a #day# not in an #hour# but in a second
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who on the previous #night# was the old jacobin the old senator the old carbonaro laughing at the guillotine the cannon and the dagger $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ playing with revolutions $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ for whom france was a vast chess #board# from which pawns rooks knights and queens were to disappear so that the #king# was checkmated $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the redoubtable was the next #morning# poor $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the helpless old #man# at the tender mercies of the weakest creature in the household that is his grandchild $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ a dumb and frozen carcass in #fact# living painlessly on that #time# may be given for his frame to decompose without his consciousness of its decay
i am #something# of a physician and have like my #fellow# sought more than once for the soul in living and in dead #matter# yet like providence it has remained invisible to my #eye# although present to my #heart#
a hundred writers since socrates seneca st augustine and gall have made in verse and prose the comparison you have made and yet i can well understand that a #father# sufferings may #effect# great changes in the #mind# of a #son#
i #will# call on you #sir# since you bid me contemplate for the advantage of my pride this terrible spectacle which must have been so great a source of sorrow to your #family#
alas #sir# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ this spectacle is neither strange to my #eye# nor my #thought#
in contrast with the old #man# who is dragging his #way# to the tomb are two #child# just entering into #life# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ the #daughter# by my first #wife# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $renée$ de $madame_de_saint_méran$ and $edward$ the #boy# whose #life# you have this #day# saved
it would have been so unquestionably had not god given me so large a compensation and what is your deduction from this compensation #sir#
my deduction is replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ that my #father# led away by his passions has committed some fault unknown to human #justice# but marked by the #justice# of god
inquired $m_de_monte_cristo$ that god desirous in his mercy to punish but #one# #person# has visited this #justice# on him alone
$m_de_monte_cristo$ with a #smile# on his #lip# uttered in the depths of his soul a groan which would have made $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ fly had he but heard it
adieu #sir# said the #magistrate# who had risen from his #seat# i leave you bearing a remembrance of you
a remembrance of esteem which i #hope# #will# not be disagreeable to you when you know me better for i am not a #man# to bore my #friend# as you #will# learn
the #count# bowed and contented himself with seeing $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ to the #door# of his cabinet the #procureur# being escorted to his #carriage# by two footmen who on a signal from their #master# followed him with every mark of #attention#
when he had gone $m_de_monte_cristo$ breathed a profound sigh and said enough of this #poison# let me now seek the antidote
besides you have made an eternal #friend# of #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ then sounding his bell he said to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ who entered
$haydée$ it #will# be recollected that the new or rather old acquaintances of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ residing in the rue meslay were no #other# than $m_maximilian_morrel$ $mademoiselle_julie$ and $m_emmanuel$
the very anticipations of delight to be enjoyed in his forthcoming #visit# the bright pure gleam of heavenly #happiness# it diffused over the almost deadly warfare in which he had voluntarily engaged illumined his whole #countenance# with a #look# of ineffable #joy# and calmness as immediately after $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ departure his #thought# flew back to the cheering prospect before him of tasting at least a brief respite from the fierce and stormy passions of his #mind#
even $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ who had hastened to obey the #count# summons went forth from his #master# #presence# in charmed amazement at the unusual animation and #pleasure# depicted on #feature# ordinarily so stern and cold while as though dreading to put to flight the agreeable #idea# hovering over his patron meditations whatever they were the faithful nubian walked on tiptoe towards the #door# holding his breath lest its faintest #sound# should dissipate his #master# happy reverie
it was noon and $m_de_monte_cristo$ had set apart #one# #hour# to be passed in the #apartment# of $haydée$ as though his oppressed spirit could not all at once admit the #feeling# of pure and unmixed #joy# but required a gradual succession of calm and gentle #emotion# to prepare his #mind# to receive full and perfect #happiness# in the same #manner# as ordinary #nature# demand to be inured by degrees to the reception of strong or violent sensations
i am going to #madame# #chamber# have the #carriage# ready at #one# clock #chapter# the young greek as we have already said occupied #apartment# wholly unconnected with those of the #count#
the #room# had been fitted up in strict accordance with oriental #idea# the #floor# were covered with the richest carpets turkey could produce the #wall# hung with brocaded silk of the most magnificent designs and texture while around each #chamber# luxurious divans were placed with piles of soft and yielding cushions that needed only to be arranged at the #pleasure# or convenience of such as sought repose
the first three remained constantly in a small waiting #room# ready to obey the summons of a small golden bell or to receive the #order# of the romaic slave who knew just enough french to be able to transmit her mistress #wish# to the three #other# waiting #woman# the latter had received most peremptory instructions from $m_de_monte_cristo$ to treat $haydée$ with all the deference they would observe to a queen
$haydée$ had three french maids and #one# who was a greek the young #girl# herself generally passed her #time# in the #chamber# at the farther #end# of her #apartment#
$haydée$ was reclining upon soft downy cushions covered with blue satin spotted with silver her #head# supported by #one# of her exquisitely moulded #arm# rested on the divan immediately behind her while the #other# was employed in adjusting to her #lip# the coral tube of a rich narghile through whose flexible pipe she drew the smoke fragrant by its passage through perfumed #water#
her attitude though perfectly natural for an eastern #woman# would in a european have been deemed too full of coquettish straining after #effect#
her dress which was that of the #woman# of epirus consisted of a pair of white satin trousers embroidered with pink roses displaying #foot# so exquisitely formed and so delicately fair that they might well have been taken for parian marble had not the #eye# been undeceived by their movements as they constantly shifted in and out of a pair of little slippers with upturned toes beautifully ornamented with #gold# and pearls
she wore a blue and white striped vest with long open sleeves trimmed with silver loops and buttons of pearls and a #sort# of bodice which closing only from the centre to the waist exhibited the whole of the ivory throat and upper #part# of the bosom it was fastened with three magnificent #diamond# clasps
the junction of the bodice and drawers was entirely concealed by #one# of the many colored scarves whose brilliant hues and rich silken fringe have rendered them so precious in the #eye# of parisian belles
tilted on #one# #side# of her #head# she had a small cap of #gold# colored silk embroidered with pearls while on the #other# a purple rose mingled its glowing colors with the luxuriant masses of her #hair# of which the blackness was so intense that it was tinged with blue
the extreme beauty of the #countenance# that shone forth in loveliness that mocked the vain attempts of dress to augment it was peculiarly and purely grecian there were the large dark melting #eye# the finely formed nose the coral #lip# and pearly teeth that belonged to her race and #country#
this was a #sort# of boudoir circular and lighted only from the roof which consisted of rose colored #glass# and to complete the whole $haydée$ was in the very springtide and fulness of youthful charms
$m_de_monte_cristo$ summoned the greek attendant and bade her inquire whether it would be agreeable to her mistress to receive his #visit#
$haydée$ only reply was to direct her #servant# by a #sign# to withdraw the tapestried curtain that hung before the #door# of her boudoir the framework of the #opening# thus made serving as a #sort# of border to the graceful tableau presented by the young #girl# picturesque attitude and #appearance#
as $m_de_monte_cristo$ approached she leaned upon the elbow of the #arm# that held the narghile and extending to him her #other# #hand# said with a #smile# of captivating sweetness in the sonorous language spoken by the #woman# of athens and sparta
she had not yet numbered more than nineteen or twenty summers why demand permission ere you enter are you no longer my #master# or have i ceased to be your slave
$m_de_monte_cristo$ returned her #smile# $haydée$ said he you well know why do you address me so coldly so distantly asked the young greek
oh if so punish me as you #will# but do not do not speak to me in #tone# and #manner# so formal and constrained
have i by any #mean# displeased you $haydée$ replied the #count# you know that you are now in france and are free
free to do what asked the young #girl# free to leave me leave you why should i leave you
that is not for me to say but we are now about to mix in society to #visit# and be visited
i dont #wish# to see anybody but you and should you see #one# whom you could prefer i would not be so unjust
i have never seen #anyone# i preferred to you and i have never loved #anyone# but you and my #father#
my poor #child# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ that is merely because your #father# and myself are the only #man# who have ever talked to you
i dont want anybody else to talk to me my #father# said i was his #joy# you style me your #love# and
both of you have called me my #child# do you remember your #father# $haydée$ the young greek smiled
he is here and here said she touching her #eye# and her #heart# and where am i inquired $m_de_monte_cristo$ laughingly
$m_de_monte_cristo$ took the delicate #hand# of the young #girl# in his and was about to raise it to his #lip# when the simple #child# of #nature# hastily withdrew it and presented her cheek
you now understand $haydée$ said the #count# that from this #moment# you are absolutely free that here you exercise unlimited sway and are at #liberty# to lay aside or continue the #costume# of your #country# as it may suit your inclination
within this mansion you are absolute mistress of your actions and may go abroad or remain in your #apartment# as may seem most agreeable to you
you cried she with #tone# of thrilling tenderness you are everywhere a #carriage# waits your #order# and $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and myrtho #will# accompany you
whithersoever you #desire# to go there is but #one# favor i would entreat of you speak guard carefully the #secret# of your birth
make no allusion to the past nor upon any occasion be induced to pronounce the #name# of your illustrious #father# or ill fated #mother#
it is possible $haydée$ that so perfect a seclusion though conformable with the habits and customs of the east may not be practicable in paris
endeavor then to accustom yourself to our #manner# of living in these northern climes as you did to those of rome florence milan and madrid it may be useful to you #one# of these #day# whether you remain here or #return# to the east
the young #girl# raised her tearful #eye# towards $m_de_monte_cristo$ as she said with touching earnestness whether we #return# to the east you #mean# to say my lord do you not
i have already told you my lord that i shall see no #one# my #child# returned $m_de_monte_cristo$
that whenever we #part# it #will# be no fault or #wish# of mine the #tree# forsakes not the flower the flower falls from the #tree#
you know full well my lord replied $haydée$ i never #will# leave you for i am sure i could not exist without you
my #father# had a long white beard but i loved him he was sixty #year# old but to me he was handsomer than all the fine youths i saw
my poor #girl# in ten #year# i shall be old and you #will# be still young
then tell me $haydée$ do you believe you shall be able to accustom yourself to our present mode of #life#
shall i see you every #day# then what do you #fear# my lord you might find it dull
in the #morning# i shall rejoice in the prospect of your coming and in the #evening# dwell with delight on the #happiness# i have enjoyed in your #presence# then too when alone i can call forth mighty pictures of the past see vast horizons bounded only by the towering mountains of pindus and olympus
oh believe me that when three great passions such as sorrow #love# and gratitude fill the #heart# ennui can find no #place#
no my lord you are a worthy #daughter# of epirus $haydée$ and your charming and poetical #idea#
depend on my #care# to see that your youth is not blighted or suffered to pass away in ungenial solitude and of this be well assured that if you #love# me as a #father# i #love# you as a #child#
prove well your descent from that race of goddesses who claim your #country# as their birthplace you are wrong my lord
the #love# i have for you is very different from the #love# i had for my #father# my #father# died but i did not die
if you were to die i should die too the #count# with a #smile# of profound tenderness extended his #hand# and she carried it to her #lip#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ thus attuned to the interview he proposed to hold with $m_maximilian_morrel$ and his #family# departed murmuring as he went these #line# of pindar
youth is a flower of which #love# is the fruit happy is he who after having watched its silent growth is permitted to gather and call it his own
the #carriage# was prepared according to #order# and stepping lightly into it the #count# drove off at his usual rapid pace
the $house_of_peers$ was of white #stone# and in a small #court# before it were two small #bed# full of beautiful flowers
in the concierge that opened the #gate# the #count# recognized $cocles$ but as he had but #one# #eye# and that #eye# had become somewhat dim in the #course# of nine #year# $cocles$ did not recognize the #count#
the #carriage# that drove up to the #door# were compelled to #turn# to avoid a fountain that played in a basin of rockwork an ornament that had excited the jealousy of the whole #quarter# and had gained for the #place# the appellation of the little versailles
#chapter# the $m_maximilian_morrel$ #family# in a very few #minute# the #count# reached no in the rue meslay it is needless to add that there were #gold# and silver fish in the basin
the whole of the property consisting of an immense workshop two pavilions at the bottom of the #garden# and the #garden# itself had been purchased by $m_emmanuel$ who had seen at a #glance# that he could make of it a profitable speculation
he had reserved the $house_of_peers$ and #half# the #garden# and building a #wall# between the #garden# and the workshops had let them upon lease with the pavilions at the bottom of the #garden#
so that for a trifling #sum# he was as well lodged and as perfectly shut out from observation as the inhabitants of the finest mansion in the faubourg st germain
the breakfast #room# was finished in oak the salon in mahogany and the furnishings were of blue velvet the bedroom was in citronwood and green damask
the $house_of_peers$ with kitchens and cellars below had above the #ground# #floor# two #story# and attics there was a #study# for $m_emmanuel$ who never studied and a music #room# for $mademoiselle_julie$ who never played
the whole of the second #story# was set apart for $m_maximilian_morrel$ it was precisely similar to his sister #apartment# except that for the breakfast parlor he had a billiard #room# where he received his #friend#
he was superintending the grooming of his #horse# and smoking his cigar at the entrance of the #garden# when the #count# #carriage# stopped at the #gate#
$cocles$ opened the #gate# and $monsieur_baptistin$ springing from the #box# inquired whether $monsieur_cavalcanti$ and #madame# herbault and $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ would see his #excellency# the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ cried $m_maximilian_morrel$ throwing away his cigar and hastening to the #carriage# i should think we would see him
and the young #officer# shook the #count# #hand# so warmly that $m_de_monte_cristo$ could not be mistaken as to the sincerity of his #joy# and he saw that he had been expected with impatience and was received with #pleasure#
ah a thousand #thank# #count# for not having forgotten your #promise# come come said $m_maximilian_morrel$ i #will# serve as your guide such a #man# as you are ought not to be introduced by a #servant#
my sister is in the #garden# plucking the dead roses my #brother# is reading his two #paper# la presse and les débats within six #step# of her for wherever you see #madame# herbault you have only to #look# within a circle of four yards and you #will# find $m_emmanuel$ and reciprocally as they say at the polytechnic school
at the #sound# of their #step# a young #woman# of twenty to five and twenty dressed in a silk #morning# gown and busily engaged in plucking the dead leaves off a noisette rose #tree# raised her #head#
this was $mademoiselle_julie$ who had become as the clerk of the $house_of_peers$ of $thomson_french_of_rome$ had predicted #madame# $m_emmanuel$ herbault
she uttered a #cry# of surprise at the #sight# of a #stranger# and $m_maximilian_morrel$ began to laugh dont disturb yourself $mademoiselle_julie$ said he
the #count# has only been two or three #day# in paris but he already knows what a fashionable #woman# of the marais is and if he does not you #will# show him
ah $monsieur_cavalcanti$ returned $mademoiselle_julie$ it is treason in my #brother# to bring you thus but he never has any regard for his poor sister
an old #man# who was digging busily at #one# of the #bed# stuck his spade in the #earth# and approached cap in #hand# striving to conceal a quid of tobacco he had just thrust into his cheek
a few locks of gray mingled with his #hair# which was still thick and matted while his bronzed #feature# and determined #glance# well suited an old #sailor# who had braved the heat of the equator and the storms of the tropics
$penelon$ penelon i think you hailed me $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_julie$ said he $penelon$ had still preserved the habit of calling his #master#
#daughter# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_julie$ and had never been able to change the #name# to #madame# herbault $penelon$ replied $mademoiselle_julie$ go and inform $m_emmanuel$ of this #gentleman# #visit# and $m_maximilian_morrel$ #will# conduct him to the salon
then turning to $m_de_monte_cristo$ i #hope# you #will# permit me to leave you for a few #minute# continued she and without awaiting any reply disappeared behind a clump of #tree# and escaped to the $house_of_peers$ by a lateral alley
i am sorry to see observed $m_de_monte_cristo$ to $m_maximilian_morrel$ that i cause no small disturbance in your $house_of_peers$
#look# there said $m_maximilian_morrel$ laughing there is her #husband# changing his jacket for a coat i assure you you are well known in the rue meslay
oh yes i assure you #count# they want #nothing# that can render them happy they are young and cheerful they are tenderly attached to each #other# and with twenty five thousand #franc# a #year# they fancy themselves as rich as rothschild
your #family# appears to be a very happy #one# said the #count# as if speaking to himself
five and twenty thousand #franc# is not a large #sum# however replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ with a #tone# so sweet and gentle that it went to $m_maximilian_morrel$ #heart# like the #voice# of a #father#
but they #will# not be content with that your #brother# in #law# is a barrister a #doctor# he was a merchant $monsieur_cavalcanti$ and had succeeded to the #business# of my poor #father#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ at his #death# left #franc# which were divided between my sister and myself for we were his only #child#
her #husband# who when he married her had no #other# patrimony than his noble probity his first rate ability and his spotless reputation wished to possess as much as his #wife#
oh i assure you #sir# it was a touching spectacle to see these young creatures destined by their talents for higher stations toiling together and through their unwillingness to change any of the customs of their paternal $house_of_peers$ taking six #year# to accomplish what less scrupulous #people# would have effected in two or three
he labored and toiled until he had amassed #franc# six #year# sufficed to achieve this object marseilles resounded with their well earned praises
at last #one# #day# $m_emmanuel$ came to his #wife# who had just finished making up the #account# $mademoiselle_julie$ said he to her
$cocles$ has just given me the last rouleau of a hundred #franc# that completes the #franc# we had fixed as the limits of our gains
our $house_of_peers$ transacts #business# to the amount of a #million# a #year# from which we derive an income of #franc#
we can dispose of the #business# if we please in an #hour# for i have received a #letter# from delaunay in which he offers to purchase the good #will# of the $house_of_peers$ to unite with his own for #franc#
can you content yourself with the small #fortune# which we shall possess for the future listen to me advise me what i had better do
$m_emmanuel$ returned my sister the $house_of_peers$ of $m_maximilian_morrel$ can only be carried on by a $m_maximilian_morrel$ is it not worth #franc# to save our #father# #name# from the #chance# of evil #fortune# and failure
this is my counsel our #account# are made up and our bills paid all we have to do is to stop the issue of any more and close our office
i #thought# so replied $m_emmanuel$ but i wished to have your advice this was done instantly
it was three clock at a #quarter# past a merchant presented himself to insure two ships it was a clear profit of #franc#
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ said $m_emmanuel$ have the goodness to address yourself to delaunay we have quitted #business#
how long inquired the astonished merchant a #quarter# of an #hour# was the reply and this is the #reason# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ continued $m_maximilian_morrel$ of my sister and #brother# in #law# having only #franc# a #year#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ had scarcely finished his #story# during which the #count# #heart# had swelled within him when $m_emmanuel$ entered wearing a hat and coat
he saluted the #count# with the #air# of a #man# who is aware of the rank of his #guest# then after having led $m_de_monte_cristo$ around the little #garden# he returned to the $house_of_peers$
$mademoiselle_julie$ suitably dressed and her #hair# arranged she had accomplished this feat in less than ten #minute# received the #count# on his entrance
the songs of the birds were heard in an aviary hard by and the branches of laburnums and rose acacias formed an exquisite framework to the blue velvet curtains
#everything# in this charming retreat from the warble of the birds to the #smile# of the mistress breathed tranquillity and repose
the #count# had felt the influence of this #happiness# from the #moment# he entered the $house_of_peers$ and he remained silent and pensive forgetting that he was expected to renew the #conversation# which had ceased after the first salutations had been exchanged
a large vase of japan porcelain filled with flowers that loaded the #air# with their perfume stood in the salon the #silence# became almost painful when by a violent #effort# tearing himself from his pleasing reverie
i pray you to excuse my #emotion# which must astonish you who are only accustomed to the #happiness# i meet here but contentment is so new a #sight# to me that i could never be weary of looking at yourself and your #husband#
#madame# said he at #length# we are very happy $monsieur_cavalcanti$ replied $mademoiselle_julie$ but we have also known unhappiness and few have ever undergone more bitter sufferings than ourselves
the #count# #feature# displayed an #expression# of the most intense curiosity oh all this is a #family# history as $baron_de_château_renaud$ told you the #other# #day# observed $m_maximilian_morrel$
this humble picture would have but little #interest# for you accustomed as you are to behold the #pleasure# and the #misfortune# of the wealthy and industrious but such as we are we have experienced bitter sorrows
and god has poured balm into your wounds as he does into those of all who are in affliction said $m_de_monte_cristo$ inquiringly
we may indeed say he has for he has done for us what he grants only to his chosen he sent us #one# of his angels
the #count# cheeks became scarlet and he coughed in #order# to have an excuse for putting his handkerchief to his mouth
those born to wealth and who have the #mean# of gratifying every #wish# said $m_emmanuel$ know not what is the real #happiness# of #life# just as those who have been tossed on the stormy #water# of the ocean on a few frail planks can alone realize the blessings of fair weather
$m_de_monte_cristo$ rose and without making any #answer# for the tremulousness of his #voice# would have betrayed his #emotion# walked up and down the #apartment# with a slow #step#
yes #count# returned $mademoiselle_julie$ our magnificence makes you #smile# #count# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ who had followed him with his #eye#
no no returned $m_de_monte_cristo$ pale as #death# pressing #one# #hand# on his #heart# to still its throbbings while with the #other# he pointed to a crystal cover beneath which a silken purse lay on a black velvet cushion
i was wondering what could be the significance of this purse with the #paper# at #one# #end# and the large #diamond# at the #other#
#count# replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ with an #air# of gravity those are our most precious #family# #treasure# the #stone# seems very brilliant answered the #count#
oh my #brother# does not allude to its value although it has been estimated at #franc# he #mean# that the articles contained in this purse are the relics of the angel i spoke of just now
this i do not comprehend and yet i may not ask for an explanation #madame# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ bowing
pardon me i had no intention of committing an indiscretion indiscretion oh you make us happy by giving us an excuse for expatiating on this #subject#
oh would we could relate it everywhere and to #everyone# so that the #emotion# of our unknown benefactor might reveal his #presence#
if we wanted to conceal the noble action this purse commemorates we should not expose it thus to view
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ returned $m_maximilian_morrel$ raising the #glass# cover and respectfully kissing the silken purse this has touched the #hand# of a #man# who saved my #father# from suicide us from ruin and our #name# from shame and disgrace a #man# by whose matchless benevolence we poor #child# doomed to want and wretchedness can at present hear #everyone# envying our happy lot
this #letter# as he spoke $m_maximilian_morrel$ drew a #letter# from the purse and gave it to the #count# this #letter# was written by him the #day# that my #father# had taken a desperate resolution and this #diamond# was given by the generous unknown to my sister as her dowry
ah really said $m_de_monte_cristo$ in a #half# stifled #voice# $m_de_monte_cristo$ opened the #letter# and read it with an indescribable #feeling# of delight
it was the #letter# written as our readers know to $mademoiselle_julie$ and signed sinbad the #sailor# unknown you say is the #man# who rendered you this #service# unknown to you
we have supplicated heaven in vain to grant us this favor but the whole #affair# has had a mysterious meaning that we cannot comprehend
yes we have never had the #happiness# of pressing his #hand# continued $m_maximilian_morrel$ we have been guided by an invisible #hand# a #hand# as powerful as that of an enchanter
i have not lost all #hope# of some #day# kissing that #hand# as i now kiss the purse which he has touched
four #year# ago $penelon$ was at trieste $penelon$ #count# is the old #sailor# you saw in the #garden# and who from quartermaster has become gardener $penelon$ when he was at trieste saw on the quay an englishman who was on the #point# of embarking on #board# a yacht and he recognized him as the #person# who called on my #father# the fifth of june and who wrote me this #letter# on the fifth of september
oh cried $mademoiselle_julie$ he felt convinced of his identity but he did not venture to address him
an englishman said $m_de_monte_cristo$ who grew uneasy at the #attention# with which $mademoiselle_julie$ looked at him an englishman you say
yes replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ an englishman who represented himself as the confidential clerk of the $house_of_peers$ of $thomson_french_of_rome$ at rome
it was this that made me start when you said the #other# #day# at de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ that messrs $thomson_french_of_rome$ were your #banker#
that happened as i told you in for god sake tell me did you know this englishman but you tell me also that the $house_of_peers$ of $thomson_french_of_rome$ have constantly denied having rendered you this #service#
then is it not probable that this englishman may be someone who grateful for a kindness your #father# had shown him and which he himself had forgotten has taken this method of requiting the obligation
yes #everything# is possible in this #affair# even a miracle what was his #name# asked $m_de_monte_cristo$
he gave no #other# #name# answered $mademoiselle_julie$ looking earnestly at the #count# than that at the #end# of his #letter# sinbad the #sailor#
which is evidently not his real #name# but a fictitious #one# then noticing that $mademoiselle_julie$ was struck with the #sound# of his #voice# tell me continued he
was he not about my height perhaps a little taller with his chin imprisoned as it were in a high cravat his coat closely buttoned up and constantly taking out his pencil
oh do you then know him cried $mademoiselle_julie$ whose #eye# sparkled with #joy# no returned $m_de_monte_cristo$
i only guessed i knew a $lord_wilmore$ who was constantly doing actions of this kind without revealing himself
he was an eccentric being and did not believe in the existence of gratitude oh heaven exclaimed $mademoiselle_julie$ clasping her #hand#
he did not credit it at the period which i knew him said $m_de_monte_cristo$ touched to the #heart# by the accents of $mademoiselle_julie$ #voice#
in what did he believe then but perhaps since then he has had #proof# that gratitude does exist
and do you know this #gentleman# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ inquired $m_emmanuel$ oh if you do know him cried $mademoiselle_julie$
can you tell us where he is where we can find him $m_maximilian_morrel$ $m_emmanuel$ if we do but discover him he must believe in the gratitude of the #heart#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ felt #tear# start into his #eye# and he again walked hastily up and down the #room# in the #name# of heaven said $m_maximilian_morrel$ if you know #anything# of him tell us what it is
alas cried $m_de_monte_cristo$ striving to repress his #emotion# if $lord_wilmore$ was your unknown benefactor i #fear# you #will# never see him again
i parted from him two #year# ago at palermo and he was then on the #point# of setting out for the most remote regions so that i #fear# he #will# never #return#
oh $monsieur_cavalcanti$ this is cruel of you said $mademoiselle_julie$ much affected and the young #lady# #eye# swam with #tear#
#madame# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ gravely and gazing earnestly on the two liquid pearls that trickled down $mademoiselle_julie$ cheeks had $lord_wilmore$ seen what i now see he would become attached to #life# for the #tear# you shed would reconcile him to mankind and he held out his #hand# to $mademoiselle_julie$ who gave him hers carried away by the #look# and accent of the #count#
but continued she $lord_wilmore$ had a #family# or #friend# he must have known someone can we not
he was my #friend# he had no #secret# from me and if this had been so he would have confided in me
oh it is useless to inquire returned the #count# perhaps after all he was not the #man# you seek for
and he told you #nothing# not a #word# #nothing# that would lead you to suppose
#nothing# and yet you spoke of him at once ah in such a #case# #one# supposes sister sister said $m_maximilian_morrel$ coming to the #count# aid $monsieur_cavalcanti$ is quite #right#
recollect what our excellent #father# so often told us it was no englishman that thus saved us $m_de_monte_cristo$ started
what did your #father# tell you $m_maximilian_morrel$ said he eagerly my #father# #thought# that this action had been miraculously performed
oh it was a touching superstition $monsieur_cavalcanti$ and although i did not myself believe it i would not for the #world# have destroyed my #father#
he believed that a benefactor had arisen from the grave to save us faith how often did he muse over it and pronounce the #name# of a dear #friend#
a #friend# lost to him forever and on his #death# #bed# when the near approach of eternity seemed to have illumined his #mind# with supernatural #light#
this #thought# which had until then been but a #doubt# became a conviction and his last #word# were $m_maximilian_morrel$ it was $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$
at these #word# the #count# paleness which had for some #time# been increasing became alarming he could not speak he looked at his watch like a #man# who has forgotten the #hour# said a few hurried #word# to #madame# herbault and pressing the #hand# of $m_emmanuel$ and $m_maximilian_morrel$ #madame# said he
i trust you #will# allow me to #visit# you occasionally i value your friendship and feel grateful to you for your welcome for this is the first #time# for many #year# that i have thus yielded to my #feeling# and he hastily quitted the #apartment#
this #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ is a strange #man# said $m_emmanuel$ yes answered $m_maximilian_morrel$ but i feel sure he has an excellent #heart# and that he likes us
his #voice# went to my #heart# observed $mademoiselle_julie$ and two or three #time# i fancied that i had heard it before
pyramus and thisbe about two thirds of the #way# along the $faubourg_saint_honoré$ and in the rear of #one# of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood where the various #house# vie with each #other# for elegance of design and magnificence of construction extended a large #garden# where the wide spreading chestnut #tree# raised their #head# high above the #wall# in a solid rampart and with the coming of every spring scattered a shower of delicate pink and white blossoms into the large #stone# vases that stood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought #iron# #gate# that dated from the #time# of $louis_xviii$ xiii
this noble entrance however in #spite# of its striking #appearance# and the graceful #effect# of the geraniums planted in the two vases as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the #eye# with their scarlet bloom had fallen into utter disuse
the proprietors of the mansion had many #year# before #thought# it best to confine themselves to the #possession# of the $house_of_peers$ itself with its thickly planted courtyard #opening# into the $faubourg_saint_honoré$ and to the #garden# shut in by this #gate# which formerly communicated with a fine kitchen #garden# of about an acre
for the demon of speculation drew a #line# or in #other# #word# projected a #street# at the farther #side# of the kitchen #garden#
the #street# was laid out a #name# was chosen and posted up on an #iron# plate but before construction was begun it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome #sum# might be obtained for the #ground# then devoted to fruits and vegetables by building along the #line# of the proposed #street# and so making it a branch of communication with the $faubourg_saint_honoré$ itself #one# of the most important thoroughfares in the city of paris
from some such difficulty the newly named #street# died almost in birth and the purchaser of the kitchen #garden# having paid a high price for it and being quite unable to find #anyone# willing to take his bargain off his #hand# without a considerable loss yet still clinging to the belief that at some future #day# he should obtain a #sum# for it that would repay him not only for his past outlay but also the #interest# upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition contented himself with letting the #ground# temporarily to some market gardeners at a yearly rental of #franc#
and so as we have said the #iron# #gate# leading into the kitchen #garden# had been closed up and left to the rust which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges while to prevent the ignoble #glance# of the diggers and delvers of the #ground# from presuming to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion the #gate# had been boarded up to a height of six #foot#
true the planks were not so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the $house_of_peers$ left no #ground# for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that #circumstance#
horticulture seemed however to have been abandoned in the deserted kitchen #garden# and where cabbages carrots radishes peas and melons had once flourished a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of cultivation
a small low #door# gave egress from the walled space we have been describing into the projected #street# the #ground# having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters and had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to #return# not even the #one# #half# per cent it had originally paid
towards the $house_of_peers$ the chestnut #tree# we have before mentioned rose high above the #wall# without in any #way# affecting the growth of #other# luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces as though asserting their #right# to enjoy the boon of #light# and #air#
at #one# #corner# where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out #day# a large #stone# bench and sundry rustic #seat# indicated that this sheltered #spot# was either in general favor or particular #use# by some inhabitant of the $house_of_peers$ which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of verdure that partially concealed it though situated but a hundred paces off
whoever had selected this retired portion of the #ground# as the boundary of a walk or as a #place# for meditation was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare the cool refreshing shade the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun
that found no entrance there even during the burning #day# of hottest summer the incessant and melodious warbling of birds and the entire removal from either the #noise# of the #street# or the bustle of the mansion
on the #evening# of #one# of the warmest #day# spring had yet bestowed on the inhabitants of paris might be seen negligently thrown upon the #stone# bench a book a parasol and a #work# basket from which hung a partly embroidered cambric handkerchief while at a little #distance# from these articles was a young #woman# standing close to the #iron# #gate# endeavoring to discern #something# on the #other# #side# by #mean# of the #opening# in the planks the earnestness of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of her #wish# proving how much her #feeling# were interested in the #matter#
at that #instant# the little #side# #gate# leading from the waste #ground# to the #street# was noiselessly opened and a tall powerful young #man# appeared
he was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap but his carefully arranged #hair# beard and moustache all of the richest and glossiest black ill accorded with his plebeian attire
after casting a rapid #glance# around him in #order# to assure himself that he was unobserved he entered by the small #gate# and carefully closing and securing it after him proceeded with a hurried #step# towards the barrier
at the #sight# of him she expected though probably not in such a #costume# the young #woman# started in #terror# and was about to make a hasty retreat
but the #eye# of #love# had already seen even through the narrow chinks of the wooden palisades the movement of the white robe and observed the fluttering of the blue sash
#chapter# in #matter# of speculation however though #man# proposes yet #money# disposes pressing his #lip# close to the planks he exclaimed
dont be alarmed $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ it is i again the timid #girl# found courage to #return# to the #gate# saying as she did so
it is almost #dinner# #time# and i had to #use# no little diplomacy to get rid of my watchful #mother# in #law# my too devoted maid and my troublesome #brother# who is always teasing me about coming to #work# at my embroidery which i am in a fair #way# never to get done
so pray excuse yourself as well as you can for having made me wait and after that tell me why i see you in a dress so singular that at first i did not recognize you
dearest $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said the young #man# the difference between our respective stations makes me #fear# to offend you by speaking of my #love# but yet i cannot find myself in your #presence# without longing to pour forth my soul and tell you how fondly i adore you
if it be but to carry away with me the recollection of such sweet #moment# i could even #thank# you for chiding me for it leaves me a gleam of #hope# that if you did not expect me and that indeed would be worse than vanity to suppose at least i was in your #thought#
and why do you come so late #today# you asked me the cause of my being late and why i come disguised
i #will# candidly explain the #reason# of both and i trust to your goodness to pardon me i have chosen a trade
a trade oh $m_maximilian_morrel$ how can you jest at a #time# when we have such deep cause for uneasiness
heaven keep me from jesting with that which is far dearer to me than #life# itself but listen to me $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and i #will# tell you all about it
i became weary of ranging fields and scaling #wall# and seriously alarmed at the #idea# suggested by you that if caught hovering about here your #father# would very likely have me sent to #prison# as a thief
that would compromise the #honor# of the french army to say #nothing# of the #fact# that the continual #presence# of a #captain# of spahis in a #place# where no warlike projects could be supposed to #account# for it might well create surprise so i have become a gardener and consequently adopted the #costume# of my calling
what excessive nonsense you talk $m_maximilian_morrel$ nonsense pray do not call what i consider the wisest action of my #life# by such a #name#
consider by becoming a gardener i effectually screen our meetings from all suspicion or danger i beseech of you $m_maximilian_morrel$ to cease trifling and tell me what you really #mean#
simply that having ascertained that the #piece# of #ground# on which i stand was to let i made application for it was readily accepted by the proprietor and am now #master# of this fine crop of lucern
there is #nothing# now to prevent my building myself a little hut on my plantation and residing not twenty yards from you
think of that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ only imagine what #happiness# that would afford me i can scarcely contain myself at the bare #idea#
but would you believe that i purchase all this delight #joy# and #happiness# for which i would cheerfully have surrendered ten #year# of my #life# at the small cost of #franc# per annum paid quarterly
i am on my own #ground# and have an undoubted #right# to #place# a ladder against the #wall# and to #look# over when i please without having any apprehensions of being taken off by the #police# as a suspicious character
i may also enjoy the precious privilege of assuring you of my fond faithful and unalterable affection whenever you #visit# your favorite bower unless indeed it offends your pride to listen to professions of #love# from the #lip# of a poor workingman clad in a blouse and cap
a faint #cry# of mingled #pleasure# and surprise escaped from the #lip# of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ who almost instantly said in a saddened #tone# as though some envious cloud darkened the #joy# which illumined her #heart#
such felicity seems above all price as a #thing# impossible and unattainable henceforth we have #nothing# to #fear# alas no $m_maximilian_morrel$ this must not be for many #reason#
we should presume too much on our own #strength# and like #other# perhaps be led astray by our blind confidence in each #other# prudence
have i not from the first blessed #hour# of our acquaintance schooled all my #word# and actions to your sentiments and #idea#
how can you for an #instant# entertain so unworthy a #thought# dear $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and you have i am sure the fullest confidence in my #honor#
when you spoke to me of experiencing a vague and indefinite sense of coming danger i placed myself blindly and devotedly at your #service# asking no #other# reward than the #pleasure# of being useful to you and have i ever since by #word# or #look# given you cause of regret for having selected me from the numbers that would willingly have sacrificed their #life# for you
you told me my dear $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ that you were engaged to $m_franz_d_épinay$ and that your #father# was resolved upon completing the match and that from his #will# there was no appeal as $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was never known to change a determination once formed
i kept in the background as you wished and waited not for the decision of your #heart# or my own but hoping that providence would graciously interpose in our behalf and #order# #event# in our favor
but what cared i for delays or difficulties $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ as long as you confessed that you loved me and took #pity# on me
ah $m_maximilian_morrel$ that is the very #thing# that makes you so bold and which renders me at once so happy and unhappy that i frequently ask myself whether it is better for me to endure the harshness of my #mother# in #law# and her blind preference for her own #child# or to be as i now am insensible to any #pleasure# save such as i find in these meetings so fraught with danger to both
if you #will# only repeat that avowal now and then i can endure #anything# i #will# not admit that #word# returned the young #man# it is at once cruel and unjust
you have permitted me to converse with you from #time# to #time# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ but forbidden my ever following you in your walks or elsewhere
and since i found #mean# to enter this enclosure to exchange a few #word# with you through this #gate# to be close to you without really seeing you
have i ever asked so much as to touch the hem of your gown or tried to pass this barrier which is but a trifle to #one# of my youth and #strength#
is it possible to find a more submissive slave than myself have i not obeyed never has a complaint or a murmur escaped me
i have been bound by my #promise# as rigidly as any knight of olden #time# come come dearest $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ confess that what i say is true lest i be tempted to call you unjust
it is true said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ as she passed the #end# of her slender #finger# through a small #opening# in the planks and permitted $m_maximilian_morrel$ to press his #lip# to them
my dear $m_maximilian_morrel$ for you well knew that from the #moment# in which you had manifested an opposite spirit all would have been ended between us
and you are a true and faithful #friend# but still you acted from motives of self #interest# you promised to bestow on me the friendly affection of a #brother#
for i have no #friend# but yourself upon #earth# who am neglected and forgotten by my #father# harassed and persecuted by my #mother# in #law# and left to the sole companionship of a paralyzed and speechless old #man# whose withered #hand# can no longer press mine and who can speak to me with the #eye# alone although there still lingers in his #heart# the warmest tenderness for his poor grandchild
oh how bitter a fate is mine to serve either as a victim or an #enemy# to all who are stronger than myself while my only #friend# and supporter is a living corpse
indeed indeed $m_maximilian_morrel$ i am very miserable and if you #love# me it must be out of #pity# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ replied the young #man# deeply affected
i #will# not say you are all i #love# in the #world# for i dearly prize my sister and #brother# in #law# but my affection for them is calm and tranquil in no #manner# resembling what i feel for you
when i think of you my #heart# beats fast the #blood# burns in my veins and i can hardly breathe but i solemnly #promise# you to restrain all this ardor this fervor and intensity of #feeling# until you yourself shall require me to render them available in serving or assisting you
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ is not expected to #return# home for a #year# to come i am told in that #time# many favorable and unforeseen #chance# may befriend us
let us then #hope# for the best #hope# is so sweet a comforter meanwhile $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ while reproaching me with selfishness think a little what you have been to me
the beautiful but cold resemblance of a marble venus what #promise# of future reward have you made me for all the submission and obedience
you tell me of $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay your betrothed lover and you shrink from the #idea# of being his #wife# but tell me $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ is there no #other# sorrow in your #heart#
my #life# and each warm drop that circles round my #heart# are consecrated to your #service# you know full well that my existence is bound up in yours
i have evinced none whatever what granted me scarcely more you see me devoted to you #body# and soul that were i to lose you
i would not outlive the #hour# of such crushing misery yet you speak with calmness of the prospect of your being the #wife# of another
oh $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ were i in your #place# and did i feel conscious as you do of being worshipped adored with such a #love# as mine a hundred #time#
at least should i have passed my #hand# between these #iron# bars and said take this #hand# dearest $m_maximilian_morrel$ and believe that living or dead i am yours
yours only and forever the poor #girl# made no reply but her lover could plainly hear her sobs and #tear#
dearest dearest $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ exclaimed he forgive me if i have offended you and forget the #word# i spoke if they have unwittingly caused you pain
a rapid change took #place# in the young #man# #feeling# no $m_maximilian_morrel$ i am not offended answered she but
$house_of_peers$ where even he is seldom seen whose #will# has been thwarted and spirits broken from the #age# of ten #year# beneath the #iron# rod so sternly held over me oppressed mortified and persecuted #day# by #day# #hour# by #hour# #minute# by #minute# no #person# has cared for even observed my sufferings nor have i ever breathed #one# #word# on the #subject# save to yourself
outwardly and in the #eye# of the #world# i am surrounded by kindness and affection but the reverse is the #case#
do you not see what a poor helpless being i am almost a #stranger# and an outcast in my #father# the general remark is
oh it cannot be expected that #one# of so stern a character as $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ could lavish the tenderness some #father# do on their #daughter#
what though she has lost her own #mother# at a tender #age# she has had the #happiness# to find a second #mother# in #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
the #world# however is mistaken my #father# abandons me from utter indifference while my #mother# in #law# detests me with a hatred so much the more terrible because it is veiled beneath a continual #smile#
hate you sweet $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ exclaimed the young #man# how is it possible for #anyone# to do that
alas replied the weeping #girl# i am obliged to own that my #mother# in #law# aversion to me arises from a very natural source
her overweening #love# for her own #child# my #brother# $edward$ but why should it i do not know
but though unwilling to introduce #money# #matter# into our present #conversation# i #will# just say this much that her extreme dislike to me has its origin there and i much #fear# she envies me the #fortune# i enjoy in #right# of my #mother# and which #will# be more than doubled at the #death# of and mme
de $madame_de_saint_méran$ whose sole heiress i am #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ has #nothing# of her own and hates me for being so richly endowed
alas how gladly would i exchange the #half# of this wealth for the #happiness# of at least sharing my #father# #love#
god knows i would prefer sacrificing the whole so that it would obtain me a happy and affectionate home poor $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
i seem to myself as though living a #life# of bondage yet at the same #time# am so conscious of my own weakness that i #fear# to break the restraint in which i am held lest i fall utterly helpless
then too my #father# is not a #person# whose #order# may be infringed with impunity protected as he is by his high #position# and firmly established reputation for talent and unswerving integrity no #one# could oppose him he is all powerful even with the #king# he would crush you at a #word#
dear $m_maximilian_morrel$ believe me when i assure you that if i do not attempt to resist my #father# commands it is more on your #account# than my own
but why $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ do you persist in anticipating the worst why picture so gloomy a future because i judge it from the past
still consider that although i may not be strictly speaking what is termed an illustrious match for you i am for many #reason# not altogether so much beneath your alliance
the #day# when such distinctions were so nicely weighed and considered no longer exist in france and the first #family# of the monarchy have intermarried with those of the empire
now i belong to this last named class and certainly my prospects of military preferment are most encouraging as well as certain
my #fortune# though small is free and unfettered and the memory of my late #father# is respected in our #country# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ as that of the most upright and honorable merchant of the city i say our #country# because you were born not far from marseilles
the aristocracy of the lance has allied itself with the nobility of the cannon dont speak of marseilles i beg of you $m_maximilian_morrel$ that #one# #word# brings back my #mother# to my recollection
my angel #mother# who died too soon for myself and all who knew her but who after watching over her #child# during the brief period allotted to her in this #world# now i fondly #hope#
oh if my #mother# were still living there would be #nothing# to #fear# $m_maximilian_morrel$ for i would tell her that i loved you and she would protect us
i #fear# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ replied the lover that were she living i should never have had the #happiness# of knowing you you would then have been too happy to have stooped from your grandeur to bestow a #thought# on me
watches from her home in heaven now it is you who are unjust $m_maximilian_morrel$ cried $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
but there is #one# #thing# i #wish# to know and what is that inquired the young #man# perceiving that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ hesitated
tell me truly $m_maximilian_morrel$ whether in former #day# when our #father# dwelt at marseilles there was ever any misunderstanding between them
not that i am aware of replied the young #man# unless indeed any ill #feeling# might have arisen from their being of opposite parties
your #father# was as you know a zealous partisan of the bourbons while mine was wholly devoted to the emperor there could not possibly be any #other# difference between them
but why do you ask i #will# tell you replied the young #girl# for it is but #right# you should know
well on the #day# when your appointment as an #officer# of the legion of #honor# was announced in the #paper# we were all sitting with my #grandfather# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was there also
do you not $m_maximilian_morrel$ the #banker# whose #horse# ran away with my #mother# in #law# and little #brother# and very nearly killed them
while the #rest# of the company were discussing the approaching #marriage# of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i was reading the #paper# to my #grandfather# but when i came to the paragraph about you although i had done #nothing# else but read it over to myself all the #morning# you know you had told me all about it the previous #evening# i felt so happy and yet so nervous at the #idea# of speaking your #name# aloud and before so many #people# that i really think i should have passed it over but for the #fear# that my doing so might create suspicions as to the cause of my #silence# so i summoned up all my courage and read it as firmly and as steadily as i could
you recollect $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ dear $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ well would you believe it directly my #father# caught the #sound# of your #name#
he turned round quite hastily and like a poor silly #thing# i was so persuaded that #everyone# must be as much affected as myself by the utterance of your #name# that i was not surprised to see my #father# start and almost tremble but i even #thought# though that surely must have been a mistake that $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ trembled too
stop a bit then knitting his #brow# into a deep frown he added surely this cannot be #one# of the $m_maximilian_morrel$ #family# who lived at marseilles and gave us so much trouble from their violent bonapartism
$m_maximilian_morrel$ morrel cried my #father# i #mean# about the #year# yes replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
i believe he is the #son# of the old shipowner indeed answered $m_maximilian_morrel$ and what did your #father# say then $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
oh such a dreadful #thing# that i dont dare to tell you always tell me #everything# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ with a #smile#
food for cannon which was precisely all they were good for and i am delighted to see that the present government have adopted this salutary principle with all its pristine vigor
if algiers were good for #nothing# but to furnish the #mean# of carrying so admirable an #idea# into practice it would be an acquisition well worthy of struggling to obtain
ah continued my #father# still frowning their idolized emperor treated these madmen as they deserved he called them though it certainly does cost france somewhat dear to assert her #right# in that uncivilized #country#
brutal politics i must confess said $m_maximilian_morrel$ but dont attach any serious importance dear to what your #father# said
does not the emperor who has devised so many clever and efficient modes of improving the art of war organize a regiment of lawyers judges and legal practitioners sending them in the hottest #fire# the #enemy# could maintain and using them to save better #man#
you see my dear that for picturesque #expression# and generosity of spirit there is not much to choose between the language of either party
my #father# was not a bit behind yours in that #sort# of talk why said he but what did $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ say to this outburst on the #part# of the #procureur#
oh he laughed and in that singular #manner# so peculiar to himself #half# malicious #half# ferocious he almost immediately got up and took his leave then for the first #time# i observed the agitation of my #grandfather# and i must tell you $m_maximilian_morrel$ that i am the only #person# capable of discerning #emotion# in his paralyzed frame
and i suspected that the #conversation# that had been carried on in his #presence# for they always say and do what they like before the dear old #man# without the smallest regard for his #feeling# had made a strong impression on his #mind# for naturally enough it must have pained him to hear the emperor he so devotedly loved and served spoken of in that depreciating #manner#
the #name# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ interposed $m_maximilian_morrel$ is celebrated throughout europe he was a statesman of high standing and you may or may not know $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ that he took a leading #part# in every bonapartist conspiracy set on #foot# during the restoration of the bourbons
oh i have often heard whispers of #thing# that seem to me most strange the #father# a bonapartist the #son# a royalist
but to resume my #story# i turned towards my #grandfather# as though to #question# him as to the cause of his #emotion# he looked expressively at the newspaper i had been reading
what can have been the #reason# of so singular a difference in parties and politics what is the #matter#
dear #grandfather# said i are you pleased he gave me a #sign# in the affirmative with what my #father# said just now
he returned a #sign# in the negative perhaps you liked what $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said another #sign# in the negative
oh then you were glad to hear that $m_maximilian_morrel$ i didnt dare to say $m_maximilian_morrel$ had been made an #officer# of the legion of #honor#
he signified assent only think of the poor old #man# being so pleased to think that you who were a perfect #stranger# to him had been made an #officer# of the legion of #honor#
perhaps it was a mere whim on his #part# for he is falling they say into second childhood but i #love# him for showing so much #interest# in you
how singular murmured $m_maximilian_morrel$ your #father# hates me while your #grandfather# on the #contrary# what strange #feeling# are aroused by politics
$m_maximilian_morrel$ leaped at #one# bound into his crop of lucern which he began to pull up in the most ruthless #way# under the pretext of being occupied in weeding it
hush cried $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ suddenly someone is coming $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ exclaimed a #voice# from behind the #tree# #madame# is searching for you everywhere there is a visitor in the #drawing# #room#
a visitor inquired $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ much agitated who is it some grand personage a prince i believe they said the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
the #name# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ sent an electric shock through the young #man# on the #other# #side# of the #iron# #gate# to whom $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
now then said $m_maximilian_morrel$ leaning on the handle of his spade i would give a good deal to know how it comes about that the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ is acquainted with $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
i #will# come directly cried $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ aloud i am coming was the customary signal of farewell
it was really the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ who had just arrived at #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ for the #purpose# of returning the #procureur# #visit# and at his #name# as may be easily imagined the whole $house_of_peers$ was in confusion
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who was alone in her #drawing# #room# when the #count# was announced desired that her #son# might be brought thither instantly to renew his #thank# to the #count# and $edward$ who heard this great personage talked of for two whole #day# made all possible haste to come to him not from obedience to his #mother# or out of any #feeling# of gratitude to the #count# but from sheer curiosity and that some #chance# remark might give him the opportunity for making #one# of the impertinent speeches which made his #mother# say
#chapter# toxicology oh that naughty #child# but i cant be severe with him he is really so bright
after the usual civilities the #count# inquired after $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ my #husband# dines with the chancellor replied the young #lady#
he has just gone and i am sure he ll be exceedingly sorry not to have had the #pleasure# of seeing you before he went
two visitors who were there when the #count# arrived having gazed at him with all their #eye# retired after that reasonable delay which politeness admits and curiosity requires
inquired #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ of $edward$ tell someone to bid her come here that i may have the #honor# of introducing her to the #count#
what is your sister $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ doing you have a #daughter# then #madame# inquired the #count# very young i presume
the #daughter# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ by his first #marriage# replied the young #wife# a fine well grown #girl#
but melancholy interrupted #master# $edward$ snatching the feathers out of the tail of a splendid paroquet that was screaming on its gilded perch in #order# to make a plume for his hat
this young madcap is however very nearly #right# and merely re echoes what he has heard me say with pain a hundred #time# for $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ is in #spite# of all we can do to rouse her of a melancholy disposition and taciturn habit which frequently injure the #effect# of her beauty
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ merely cried be still $edward$ she then added but what detains her go $edward$ and see
because they are looking for her where she is not to be found and where are they looking for her
with grandpapa $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and do you think she is not there no no no no no she is not there replied $edward$ singing his #word#
she is under the big chestnut #tree# replied the spoiled brat as he gave in #spite# of his #mother# commands live flies to the parrot which seemed keenly to relish such fare
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ stretched out her #hand# to ring intending to direct her waiting maid to the #spot# where she would find $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ when the young #lady# herself entered the #apartment#
she appeared much dejected and any #person# who considered her attentively might have observed the traces of recent #tear# in her #eye#
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ whom we have in the rapid march of our narrative presented to our readers without formally introducing her was a tall and graceful #girl# of nineteen with bright chestnut #hair# deep blue #eye# and that reposeful #air# of quiet distinction which characterized her #mother#
her white and slender #finger# her pearly neck her cheeks tinted with varying hues reminded #one# of the lovely englishwomen who have been so poetically compared in their #manner# to the gracefulness of a swan
she entered the #apartment# and seeing near her stepmother the #stranger# of whom she had already heard so much saluted him without any girlish awkwardness or even lowering her #eye# and with an elegance that redoubled the #count# #attention#
and where is she then if you know why dont you tell he rose to #return# the salutation
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ my #step# #daughter# said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ to $m_de_monte_cristo$ leaning back on her sofa and motioning towards $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ with her #hand#
and de $m_de_monte_cristo$ #king# of china emperor of cochin china said the young imp looking slyly towards his sister
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ at this really did #turn# pale and was very nearly angry with this household plague who answered to the #name# of $edward$ but the #count# on the #contrary# smiled and appeared to #look# at the #boy# complacently which caused the maternal #heart# to bound again with #joy# and enthusiasm
but #madame# replied the #count# continuing the #conversation# and looking by #turn# at #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ have i not already had the #honor# of meeting yourself and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ before
i could not help thinking so just now the #idea# came over my #mind# and as $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ entered the #sight# of her was an additional ray of #light# thrown on a confused remembrance excuse the remark
i do not think it likely #sir# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ is not very fond of society and we very seldom go out said the young #lady#
then it was not in society that i met with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ or yourself #madame# or this charming little merry #boy#
besides the parisian #world# is entirely unknown to me for as i believe i told you i have been in paris but very few #day#
no but perhaps you #will# permit me to call to #mind# stay the #count# placed his #hand# on his #brow# as if to collect his #thought#
but it appears that this recollection is connected with a lovely sky and some religious fête $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was holding flowers in her #hand# the interesting #boy# was chasing a beautiful peacock in a #garden# and you #madame# were under the trellis of some arbor
no it was somewhere away from here it was i do not know pray come to my aid #madame# do not these #circumstance# appeal to your memory
and yet it appears to me #sir# that if i had met you anywhere the recollection of you must have been imprinted on my memory
no indeed replied #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ perhaps the #count# saw us in italy said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ timidly
yes in italy it was in italy most probably replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ you have travelled then in italy $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
yes #madame# and i were there two #year# ago the #doctor# anxious for my lungs had prescribed the #air# of naples
we went by bologna perugia and rome ah yes true $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ exclaimed $m_de_monte_cristo$ as if this simple explanation was sufficient to revive the recollection he sought
it was at perugia on corpus christi #day# in the #garden# of the hôtel des postes when #chance# brought us together you #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and her #son# i now remember having had the #honor# of meeting you
i perfectly well remember perugia #sir# and the hôtel des postes and the festival of which you speak said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
but in vain do i tax my memory of whose treachery i am ashamed for i really do not recall to #mind# that i ever had the #pleasure# of seeing you before
it is strange but neither do i recollect meeting with you observed $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ raising her beautiful #eye# to the #count#
i #will# assist your memory #madame# continued the #count# the #day# had been burning hot you were waiting for #horse# which were delayed in consequence of the festival
but i remember it perfectly interposed the darling $edward$ $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was walking in the shade of the #garden# and your #son# disappeared in pursuit of the peacock
and i caught it mamma dont you remember interposed $edward$ and i pulled three such beautiful feathers out of his tail
you #madame# remained under the arbor do you not remember that while you were seated on a #stone# bench and while as i told you $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and your young #son# were absent you conversed for a considerable #time# with somebody
yes in #truth# yes answered the young #lady# turning very red i do remember conversing with a #person# wrapped in a long woollen mantle he was a medical #man# i think
precisely so #madame# this #man# was myself for a fortnight i had been at that hotel during which period i had cured my #valet# de chambre of a fever and my landlord of the jaundice so that i really acquired a reputation as a skilful physician
we discoursed a long #time# #madame# on different #subject# of perugino of raphael of #manner# customs of the famous aqua tofana of which they had told you i think you said that certain individuals in perugia had preserved the #secret#
yes true replied #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ somewhat uneasily i remember now
i do not recollect now all the various #subject# of which we discoursed #madame# continued the #count# with perfect calmness
but i perfectly remember that falling into the error which #other# had entertained respecting me you consulted me as to the health of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
yes really #sir# you were in #fact# a medical #man# said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ since you had cured the sick
molière or beaumarchais would reply to you #madame# that it was precisely because i was not that i had cured my patients for myself i am content to say to you that i have studied chemistry and the natural sciences somewhat deeply but still only as an amateur you understand
at this #moment# the clock struck six it is six clock said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ evidently agitated
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #will# you not go and see if your grandpapa #will# have his #dinner# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ rose and saluting the #count# left the #apartment# without speaking
oh #madame# said the #count# when $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had left the #room# was it on my #account# that you sent $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ away
by no #mean# replied the young #lady# quickly but this is the #hour# when we usually give $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the unwelcome meal that sustains his pitiful existence
you are aware #sir# of the deplorable condition of my #husband# #father# yes #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ spoke of it to me
alas yes the poor old #gentleman# is entirely helpless the #mind# alone is still active in this human machine and that is faint and flickering like the #light# of a lamp about to expire
but excuse me #sir# for talking of our domestic #misfortune# i interrupted you at the #moment# when you were telling me that you were a skilful chemist
a paralysis i think no #madame# i did not say as much as that replied the #count# with a #smile#
i have studied chemistry because having determined to live in eastern climates i have been desirous of following the example of #king# mithridates
mithridates rex ponticus said the young scamp as he tore some beautiful portraits out of a splendid album the individual who took cream in his cup of #poison# every #morning# at breakfast
quite the #contrary# $edward$ you naughty #boy# exclaimed #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ snatching the mutilated book from the urchin
you are positively past bearing you really disturb the #conversation# go leave us and join your sister $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ in dear grandpapa
grasp $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #room# the album said $edward$ sulkily what do you #mean# the album i want the album
how dare you #tear# out the #drawing# oh it amuses me go go at once
i wont go unless you give me the album said the #boy# seating himself doggedly in an armchair according to his habit of never giving #way#
take it then and pray disturb us no longer said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ giving the album to $edward$ who then went towards the #door# led by his #mother#
the #count# followed her with his #eye# let us see if she shuts the #door# after him he muttered
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ closed the #door# carefully after the #child# the #count# appearing not to notice her then casting a scrutinizing #glance# around the #chamber# the young #wife# returned to her #chair# in which she seated herself
allow me to observe #madame# said the #count# with that kind #tone# he could assume so well you are really very severe with that dear clever #child#
it was his cornelius nepos that #master# $edward$ was repeating when he referred to #king# mithridates continued the #count# and you interrupted him in a quotation which proves that his tutor has by no #mean# neglected him for your #son# is really advanced for his #year#
oh sometimes severity is quite necessary replied #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with all a #mother# real firmness
the #fact# is #count# answered the #mother# agreeably flattered he has great aptitude and learns all that is set before him
he has but #one# fault he is somewhat wilful but really on referring for the #moment# to what he said do you truly believe that mithridates used these precautions and that these precautions were efficacious
i think so #madame# because i myself have made #use# of them that i might not be poisoned at naples at palermo and at smyrna that is to say on three several occasions when but for these precautions i must have lost my #life#
and your precautions were successful completely so yes i remember now your mentioning to me at perugia #something# of this #sort#
indeed said the #count# with an #air# of surprise remarkably well counterfeited i really did not remember
i inquired of you if #poison# acted equally and with the same #effect# on #man# of the north as on #man# of the south and you answered me that the cold and sluggish habits of the north did not present the same aptitude as the rich and energetic temperaments of the natives of the south
i have seen russians devour without being visibly inconvenienced vegetable substances which would infallibly have killed a neapolitan or an arab
and you really believe the result would be still more sure with us than in the east and in the midst of our fogs and rains a #man# would habituate himself more easily than in a warm latitude to this progressive absorption of #poison#
certainly it being at the same #time# perfectly understood that he should have been duly fortified against the #poison# to which he had not been accustomed
and that is the #case# observed $m_de_monte_cristo$ yes i understand that and how would you habituate yourself for instance or rather
suppose you knew beforehand the #poison# that would be made #use# of against you suppose the #poison# was for instance brucine
how did you habituate yourself to it oh very easily brucine is extracted from the false angostura is it not
inquired #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ precisely #madame# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ but i perceive i have not much to teach you
allow me to compliment you on your knowledge such learning is very rare among #lady# oh i am aware of that said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
but i have a passion for the occult sciences which speak to the imagination like poetry and are reducible to figures like an algebraic equation but go on
i beg of you what you say #interest# me to the greatest degree well replied $m_de_monte_cristo$
suppose then that this #poison# was brucine and you were to take a milligramme the first #day# two milligrammes the second #day# and so on
well at the #end# of ten #day# you would have taken a centigramme at the #end# of twenty #day# increasing another milligramme you would have taken three hundred centigrammes that is to say a dose which you would support without inconvenience and which would be very dangerous for any #other# #person# who had not taken the same precautions as yourself
well then at the #end# of a #month# when drinking #water# from the same carafe you would kill the #person# who drank with you without your perceiving otherwise than from slight inconvenience that there was any poisonous substance mingled with this #water#
i have often read and read again the history of mithridates said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in a #tone# of reflection and had always considered it a fable
no #madame# #contrary# to most history it is true but what you tell me #madame# what you inquire of me is not the result of a #chance# query for
two #year# ago you asked me the same #question# and said then that for a very long #time# this history of mithridates had occupied your #mind#
do you know any #other# counter #poison# i do not true #sir#
the two favorite #study# of my youth were botany and mineralogy and subsequently when i learned that the #use# of simples frequently explained the whole history of a #people# and the entire #life# of individuals in the east as flowers betoken and symbolize a #love# #affair# i have regretted that i was not a #man# that i might have been a flamel a fontana or a cabanis
and the more #madame# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ as the orientals do not confine themselves as did mithridates to make a cuirass of his #poison# but they also made them a dagger
science becomes in their #hand# not only a defensive weapon but still more frequently an offensive #one# the #one# serves against all their physical sufferings the #other# against all their #enemy#
there is not #one# of those #woman# egyptian turkish or greek whom here you call good #woman# who do not know how by #mean# of chemistry to stupefy a #doctor# and in psychology to amaze a confessor
with opium belladonna brucea snake wood and the cherry laurel they put to sleep all who stand in their #way#
really said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ whose #eye# sparkled with strange #fire# at this #conversation# oh yes indeed #madame# continued $m_de_monte_cristo$
the #secret# dramas of the east begin with a #love# philtre and #end# with a #death# potion begin with paradise and #end# with hell
there are as many elixirs of every kind as there are caprices and peculiarities in the physical and moral #nature# of humanity and i #will# say further the art of these chemists is capable with the utmost precision to accommodate and proportion the remedy and the bane to yearnings for #love# or #desire# for vengeance
these eastern societies in the midst of which you have passed a portion of your existence are as fantastic as the tales that come from their strange land
a #man# can easily be put out of the #way# there then it is indeed the bagdad and bassora of the thousand and #one# #night#
the sultans and viziers who rule over society there and who constitute what in france we call the government are really haroun al raschids and giaffars who not only pardon a poisoner but even make him a prime #minister# if his #crime# has been an ingenious #one# and who under such #circumstance# have the whole #story# written in #letter# of #gold# to divert their #hour# of idleness and ennui
but #sir# remarked the young #woman# by no #mean# #madame# the fanciful exists no longer in the east
they hang behead and impale their criminals in the most agreeable possible #manner# but some of these like clever rogues have contrived to escape human #justice# and succeed in their fraudulent enterprises by cunning stratagems
amongst us a simpleton possessed by the demon of hate or cupidity who has an #enemy# to destroy or some near relation to dispose of goes straight to the grocer or druggist gives a false #name# which leads more easily to his detection than his real #one# and under the pretext that the rats prevent him from sleeping purchases five or six grammes of arsenic if he is really a cunning #fellow# he goes to five or six different druggists or grocers and thereby becomes only five or six #time# more easily
when he has acquired his specific he administers duly to his #enemy# or near kinsman a dose of arsenic which would make a mammoth or mastodon burst and which without rhyme or #reason# makes his victim utter groans which alarm the entire neighborhood
there disguised under #other# #name# and concealed under #other# #costume# are #police# agents #magistrate# attorneys general and bailiffs traced then then arrive a crowd of policemen and constables
they fetch a #doctor# who opens the dead #body# and collects from the entrails and stomach a quantity of arsenic in a spoon
the same #evening# the grocer or grocers druggist or druggists come and say it was i who sold the arsenic to the #gentleman# and rather than not recognize the guilty purchaser they #will# recognize twenty
then the foolish criminal is taken imprisoned interrogated confronted confounded condemned and cut off by hemp or steel or if she be a #woman# of any consideration they lock her up for #life#
next #day# a hundred newspapers relate the #fact# with the #name# of the victim and the murderer this is the #way# in which you northerns understand chemistry #madame#
desrues was however i must confess more skilful what would you have #sir# said the #lady# laughing we do what we can
all the #world# has not the #secret# of the medicis or the borgias now replied the #count# shrugging his #shoulder#
it is because at your theatres by what at least i could judge by reading the #piece# they play they see #person# swallow the contents of a phial or suck the button of a ring and fall dead instantly
they are ignorant of the consequences of the murder they see neither the #police# commissary with his badge of office nor the corporal with his four #man# and so the poor fools believe that the whole #thing# is as easy as lying
but go a little #way# from france go either to aleppo or cairo or only to naples or rome and you #will# see #people# passing by you in the #street# #people# erect smiling and fresh colored of whom asmodeus if you were holding on by the skirt of his mantle would say that #man# was poisoned three weeks ago he #will# be a dead #man# in a #month#
shall i tell you the cause of all these stupidities five #minute# afterwards the curtain falls and the spectators depart
then remarked #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ they have again discovered the #secret# of the famous aqua tofana that they said was lost at perugia
the arts change about and make a tour of the #world# #thing# take a different #name# and the vulgar do not follow them that is all but there is always the same result
ah but #madame# does mankind ever lose #anything# #poison# act particularly on some organ or another #one# on the stomach another on the brain another on the intestines
well the #poison# brings on a cough the cough an inflammation of the lungs or some #other# complaint catalogued in the book of science which however by no #mean# precludes it from being decidedly mortal and if it were not would be sure to become so #thank# to the remedies applied by foolish #doctor# who are generally bad chemists and which #will# act in favor of or against the malady as you please and then there is a human being killed according to all the rules of art and skill and of whom #justice# learns #nothing# as was said by a terrible chemist of my acquaintance the worthy #abbé# adelmonte of taormina in sicily who has studied these national phenomena very profoundly
it is quite frightful but deeply interesting said the young #lady# motionless with #attention# i #thought# i must confess that these tales were inventions of the middle #age#
what is the #use# of #time# rewards of merit medals crosses monthyon prizes if they do not lead society towards more complete perfection
yet #man# #will# never be perfect until he learns to create and destroy he does know how to destroy and that is #half# the battle
so added #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ constantly returning to her object the #poison# of the borgias the medicis the renées the ruggieris and later probably that of #baron# de trenck whose #story# has been so misused by modern drama and romance
yes no #doubt# but improved upon by ours were objects of art #madame# and #nothing# more replied the #count#
do you suppose that the real savant addresses himself stupidly to the mere individual by no #mean# science loves eccentricities leaps and bounds trials of #strength# fancies if i may be allowed so to term them
thus for instance the excellent #abbé# adelmonte of whom i spoke just now made in this #way# some marvellous experiments
really yes i #will# mention #one# to you he had a remarkably fine #garden# full of vegetables flowers and fruit
for three #day# he watered this cabbage with a distillation of arsenic on the third the cabbage began to droop and #turn# yellow
from amongst these vegetables he selected the most simple a cabbage for instance at that #moment# he cut it in the #eye# of everybody it seemed fit for #table# and preserved its wholesome #appearance#
he then took the cabbage to the #room# where he had rabbits for the #abbé# adelmonte had a collection of rabbits cats and guinea pigs fully as fine as his collection of vegetables flowers and fruit
it was only poisoned to the #abbé# adelmonte well the #abbé# adelmonte took a rabbit and made it eat a leaf of the cabbage
what #procureur# has ever ventured to draw up an accusation against magendie or flourens in consequence of the rabbits cats and guinea pigs
the rabbit died what #magistrate# would find or even venture to insinuate #anything# against this they have killed not #one# so then the rabbit dies and #justice# takes no notice
this rabbit dead the #abbé# adelmonte has its entrails taken out by his cook and thrown on the dunghill on this dunghill is a hen who pecking these intestines is in her #turn# taken ill and dies next #day#
at the #moment# when she is struggling in the convulsions of #death# a vulture is flying by there are a good many vultures in adelmonte #country# this bird darts on the dead fowl and carries it away to a #rock# where it dines off its prey
three #day# afterwards this poor vulture which has been very much indisposed since that #dinner# suddenly feels very giddy while flying aloft in the clouds and falls heavily into a fish pond
now suppose that next #day# #one# of these eels or pike or carp poisoned at the fourth remove is served up at your #table#
well then your #guest# #will# be poisoned at the fifth remove and die at the #end# of eight or ten #day# of pains in the intestines sickness or abscess of the pylorus
the pike eels and carp eat greedily always as everybody knows well they feast on the vulture the #doctor# open the #body# and say with an #air# of profound learning
the #subject# has died of a tumor on the liver or of typhoid fever but remarked #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
all these #circumstance# which you link thus to #one# another may be broken by the least accident the vulture may not see the fowl or may fall a hundred yards from the fish pond
ah that is where the art comes in to be a great chemist in the east #one# must direct #chance# and this is to be achieved
arsenic is indelible indestructible in whatsoever #way# it is absorbed it #will# be found again in the #body# of the victim from the #moment# when it has been taken in sufficient quantity to cause #death#
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was in deep #thought# yet listened attentively but she exclaimed suddenly precisely so cried $m_de_monte_cristo$ precisely so and this is what i said to my worthy adelmonte
he reflected smiled and replied to me by a sicilian proverb which i believe is also a french proverb my #son# the #world# was not made in a #day#
instead of having watered his cabbage with arsenic he had watered it this #time# with a solution of salts having their basis in strychnine strychnos colubrina as the learned term it
now the cabbage had not the slightest #appearance# of disease in the #world# and the rabbit had not the smallest distrust yet five #minute# afterwards the rabbit was dead
but in seven #return# on sunday on the sunday following i did #return# to him the fowl pecked at the rabbit and the next #day# was a dead hen
this #time# we were the vultures so we opened the bird and this #time# all special symptoms had disappeared there were only general symptoms
there was no peculiar indication in any organ an excitement of the nervous system that was it a #case# of cerebral congestion #nothing# more
the fowl had not been poisoned she had died of apoplexy apoplexy is a rare disease among fowls i believe but very common among #man#
it is very fortunate she observed that such substances could only be prepared by chemists otherwise all the #world# would be poisoning each #other#
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ appeared more and more thoughtful by chemists and #person# who have a taste for chemistry said $m_de_monte_cristo$ carelessly
and then said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ endeavoring by a struggle and with #effort# to get away from her #thought# however skilfully it is prepared #crime# is always #crime# and if it avoid human scrutiny it does not escape the #eye# of god
the orientals are stronger than we are in #case# of conscience and very prudently have no hell that is the #point#
really #madame# this is a scruple which naturally must occur to a pure #mind# like yours but which would easily yield before #sound# reasoning
the bad #side# of human #thought# #will# always be defined by the paradox of jean jacques rousseau you remember the mandarin who is killed five hundred leagues off by raising the tip of the #finger#
you #will# find very few #person# who #will# go and brutally thrust a knife in the #heart# of a #fellow# creature or #will# administer to him in #order# to remove him from the surface of the globe on which we move with #life# and animation that quantity of arsenic of which we just now talked
#man# whole #life# passes in doing these #thing# and his intellect is exhausted by reflecting on them such a #thing# is really out of rule eccentric or stupid
to attain such a #point# the #blood# must be heated to thirty six degrees the pulse be at least at ninety and the #feeling# excited beyond the ordinary limit
but suppose #one# pass as is permissible in philology from the #word# itself to its softened synonym then instead of committing an ignoble assassination you make an elimination you merely and simply remove from your path the individual who is in your #way# and that without shock or violence without the display of the sufferings which in the #case# of becoming a punishment make a martyr of the victim and a butcher in every sense of the #word# of him who inflicts them
then there #will# be no #blood# no groans no convulsions and above all no consciousness of that horrid and compromising #moment# of accomplishing the act then #one# escapes the clutch of the human #law# which says do not disturb society
this is the mode in which they manage these #thing# and succeed in eastern climes where there are grave and phlegmatic #person# who #care# very little for the #question# of #time# in conjunctures of importance
yet conscience remains remarked #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in an agitated #voice# and with a stifled sigh yes answered $m_de_monte_cristo$ happily yes conscience does remain and if it did not how wretched we should be
after every action requiring exertion it is conscience that saves us for it supplies us with a thousand good excuses of which we alone are judges and these #reason# howsoever excellent in producing sleep would avail us but very little before a tribunal when we were tried for our #life#
thus richard iii for instance was marvellously served by his conscience after the putting away of the two #child# of $edward$ iv
in #fact# he could say these two #child# of a cruel and persecuting #king# who have inherited the vices of their #father# which i alone could perceive in their juvenile propensities
these two #child# are impediments in my #way# of promoting the #happiness# of the english #people# whose unhappiness they the #child# would infallibly have caused
thus was #lady# macbeth served by her conscience when she sought to give her #son# and not her #husband# whatever shakespeare may say a throne
ah maternal #love# is a great virtue a powerful motive so powerful that it excuses a multitude of #thing# even if after duncan #death# #lady# macbeth had been at all pricked by her conscience
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ listened with avidity to these appalling maxims and horrible paradoxes delivered by the #count# with that ironical simplicity which was peculiar to him
do you know my dear #count# she said that you are a very terrible reasoner and that you #look# at the #world# through a somewhat distempered medium
after a #moment# #silence# the #lady# inquired have you really measured the #world# by scrutinies or through alembics and crucibles
for you must indeed be a great chemist and the elixir you administered to my #son# which recalled him to #life# almost instantaneously m
#one# drop of that elixir sufficed to recall #life# to a dying #child# but three drops would have impelled the #blood# into his lungs in such a #way# as to have produced most violent palpitations six would have suspended his respiration and caused syncope more serious than that in which he was ten would have destroyed him
oh do not #place# any reliance on that #madame# you know #madame# how suddenly i snatched him from those phials which he so imprudently touched
in the first #place# let us agree that the #word# #poison# does not exist because in medicine #use# is made of the most violent #poison# which become according as they are employed most salutary remedies
is it then so terrible a #poison# oh no what then is it a skilful preparation of my #friend# the worthy #abbé# adelmonte who taught me the #use# of it
oh observed #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ it must be an admirable anti spasmodic perfect #madame# as you have seen replied the #count#
and i frequently make #use# of it with all possible prudence though be it observed he added with a #smile# of intelligence
as for me so nervous and so #subject# to fainting fits i should require a #doctor# adelmonte to invent for me some #mean# of breathing freely and tranquillizing my #mind# in the #fear# i have of dying some fine #day# of suffocation
in the meanwhile as the #thing# is difficult to find in france and your #abbé# is not probably disposed to make a journey to paris on my #account# i must continue to #use# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ planche anti spasmodics and mint and hoffman drops are among my favorite remedies
most assuredly responded #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in the same #tone# here are some lozenges which i have made up on #purpose# they are compounded doubly strong
$m_de_monte_cristo$ opened the tortoise shell #box# which the #lady# presented to him and inhaled the odor of the lozenges with the #air# of an amateur who thoroughly appreciated their composition
they are indeed exquisite he said but as they are necessarily submitted to the process of deglutition a function which it is frequently impossible for a fainting #person# to accomplish
undoubtedly and so should i prefer it after the #effect# i have seen produced but of #course# it is a #secret# and i am not so indiscreet as to ask it of you
i prefer my own specific but i said $m_de_monte_cristo$ rising as he spoke i am gallant enough to offer it you
how kind you are only remember #one# #thing# a small dose is a remedy a large #one# is #poison#
#one# drop #will# restore #life# as you have seen five or six #will# inevitably kill and in a #way# the more terrible inasmuch as poured into a #glass# of wine it would not in the slightest degree affect its flavor
the clock struck #half# past six and a #lady# was announced a #friend# of #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who came to dine with her
if i had had the #honor# of seeing you for the third or fourth #time# #count# instead of only for the second said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
if i had had the #honor# of being your #friend# instead of only having the #happiness# of being under an obligation to you i should insist on detaining you to #dinner# and not allow myself to be daunted by a first refusal
but i say no more #madame# it is really as if i were prescribing for you
i have promised to escort to the académie a greek princess of my acquaintance who has never seen your grand opera and who relies on me to conduct her thither
a thousand #thank# #madame# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ but i have an engagement which i cannot break adieu then #sir# and do not forget the prescription
ah in #truth# #madame# to do that i must forget the #hour# #conversation# i have had with you which is indeed impossible
$m_de_monte_cristo$ bowed and left the $house_of_peers$ #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ remained immersed in #thought# he is a very strange #man# she said
and in my #opinion# is himself the adelmonte he talks about as to $m_de_monte_cristo$ the result had surpassed his utmost expectations
good said he as he went away this is a fruitful soil and i feel certain that the seed sown #will# not be cast on barren #ground#
the pretext of an opera engagement was so much the more feasible as there chanced to be on that very #night# a more than ordinary attraction at the académie royale
levasseur who had been suffering under severe illness made his reappearance in the character of bertram and as usual the announcement of the most admired production of the favorite composer of the #day# had attracted a brilliant and fashionable audience
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ like most #other# young #man# of rank and #fortune# had his orchestra stall with the certainty of always finding a #seat# in at least a dozen of the principal #box# occupied by #person# of his acquaintance he had moreover his #right# of entry into the omnibus #box#
next #morning# faithful to his #promise# he sent the prescription requested #chapter# robert le diable $baron_de_château_renaud$ rented a stall beside his own while $m_beauchamp$ as a journalist had unlimited range all over the theatre
it happened that on this particular #night# the #minister# #box# was placed at the disposal of $m_lucien_debray$ who offered it to the comte de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who again upon his rejection of it by $mercédès$ sent it to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with an intimation that he should probably do himself the #honor# of joining the #baroness# and her #daughter# during the #evening# in the #event# of their accepting the #box# in #question#
to no class of #person# is the presentation of a gratuitous opera #box# more acceptable than to the wealthy millionaire who still hugs economy while boasting of carrying a #king# ransom in his waistcoat #pocket#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had however protested against showing himself in a ministerial #box# declaring that his political principles and his parliamentary #position# as member of the opposition party would not permit him so to commit himself the #baroness# had therefore despatched a #note# to $m_lucien_debray$ bidding him call for them it being wholly impossible for her to go alone with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to the opera
there is no gainsaying the #fact# that a very unfavorable construction would have been put upon the #circumstance# if the two #woman# had gone without escort while the addition of a third in the #person# of her #mother# admitted lover enabled $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to defy malice and ill #nature#
the #lady# received the offer with too much #pleasure# to #dream# of a refusal #one# must take the #world# as #one# finds it
the curtain rose as usual to an almost empty $house_of_peers$ it being #one# of the absurdities of parisian fashion never to appear at the opera until after the beginning of the performance so that the first act is generally played without the slightest #attention# being paid to it that #part# of the audience already assembled being too much occupied in observing the fresh arrivals while #nothing# is heard but the #noise# of #opening# and shutting #door# and the buzz of #conversation#
surely said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ as the #door# of a #box# on the first circle opened that must be the #countess#
now do you know #baron# i have a great #mind# to pick a quarrel with you for asking it as if all the #world# did not know who the #countess# was
and who is the #countess# inquired $baron_de_château_renaud$ what a #question# ah to be sure replied $baron_de_château_renaud$ the lovely venetian is it not
herself at this #moment# the #countess# perceived $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and returned his salutation with a #smile# you know her it seems said $baron_de_château_renaud$
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ introduced me to her at rome replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ well then #will# you do as much for me in paris as $m_franz_de_quesnel$ did for you in rome
this manifestation on the #part# of the spectators of their #wish# to be allowed to hear the music produced not the slightest #effect# on the two young #man# who continued their #conversation#
with #pleasure# there was a #cry# of shut up from the audience the #countess# was present at the races in the champ de mars said $baron_de_château_renaud$
#today# yes bless me i quite forgot the races did you bet oh merely a paltry fifty $louis_xviii$
and who was the winner nautilus i staked on him but there were three races were there not
yes there was the prize given by the jockey club a #gold# cup you know and a very singular #circumstance# occurred about that race
what was it oh shut up again interposed some of the audience why it was won by a #horse# and rider utterly unknown on the #course#
the #fact# was nobody had observed a #horse# entered by the #name# of $luigi_vampa$ or that of a jockey styled job when at the last #moment# a splendid roan mounted by a jockey about as big as your fist presented themselves at the starting post
they were obliged to stuff at least twenty pounds weight of shot in the small rider #pocket# to make him weight but with all that he outstripped ariel and barbare against whom he ran by at least three whole #length#
is that possible true as #day# and was it not found out at last to whom the #horse# and jockey belonged
no you say that the #horse# was entered under the #name# of $luigi_vampa$ exactly that was the title
then answered $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i am better informed than you are and know who the owner of that #horse# was
and this #time# the #tone# and #manner# in which the command was given betokened such growing hostility that the two young #man# perceived for the first #time# that the mandate was addressed to them
leisurely turning round they calmly scrutinized the various #countenance# around them as though demanding some #one# #person# who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they deemed excessive impertinence but as no #one# responded to the challenge the #friend# turned again to the front of the theatre and affected to busy themselves with the stage
at this #moment# the #door# of the #minister# #box# opened and #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ accompanied by her #daughter# entered escorted by $m_lucien_debray$ who assiduously conducted them to their #seat#
shut up there cried the pit in chorus ha ha said $baron_de_château_renaud$ here come some #friend# of yours viscount
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ turned round just in #time# to receive a gracious wave of the fan from the #baroness# as for $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ she scarcely vouchsafed to waste the #glance# of her large black #eye# even upon the #business# of the stage
what are you looking at there dont you see they are trying to catch your #eye# i tell you what my dear #fellow# said $baron_de_château_renaud$
i cannot imagine what objection you can possibly have to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ that is setting aside her want of ancestry and somewhat inferior rank which by the #way# i dont think you #care# very much about
now barring all that i #mean# to say she is a deuced fine #girl# handsome certainly replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but not to my taste which i confess inclines to #something# softer gentler and more feminine
ah well exclaimed $baron_de_château_renaud$ who because he had seen his thirtieth summer fancied himself duly warranted in assuming a #sort# of paternal #air# with his more youthful #friend# you young #people# are never satisfied why what would you have more
your parents have chosen you a bride built on the model of diana the huntress and yet you are not content
no for that very resemblance affrights me i should have liked #something# more in the #manner# of the venus of milo or capua but this chase loving diana continually surrounded by her nymphs gives me a #sort# of alarm lest she should some #day# bring on me the fate of actæon
and indeed it required but #one# #glance# at $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to comprehend the justness of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ remark
she was beautiful but her beauty was of too marked and decided a character to please a fastidious taste her #hair# was raven black but its natural waves seemed somewhat rebellious her #eye# of the same color as her #hair# were surmounted by well arched #brow# whose great defect however consisted in an almost habitual frown while her whole physiognomy wore that #expression# of firmness and decision so little in accordance with the gentler attributes of her sex
her mouth which might have been found fault with as too large displayed teeth of pearly whiteness rendered still more conspicuous by the brilliant carmine of her #lip# contrasting vividly with her naturally pale complexion
but that which completed the almost masculine #look# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ found so little to his taste was a dark mole of much larger dimensions than these freaks of #nature# generally are placed just at the #corner# of her mouth and the #effect# tended to increase the #expression# of self dependence that characterized her #countenance#
the #rest# of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #person# was in perfect keeping with the #head# just described she indeed reminded #one# of diana as $baron_de_château_renaud$ observed but her bearing was more haughty and resolute
as regarded her attainments the only fault to be found with them was the same that a fastidious connoisseur might have found with her beauty that they were somewhat too erudite and masculine for so young a #person#
she was a perfect linguist a first rate artist wrote poetry and composed music to the #study# of the latter she professed to be entirely devoted following it with an indefatigable perseverance assisted by a schoolfellow a young #woman# without #fortune# whose talent promised to develop into remarkable #power# as a singer
it was rumored that she was an object of almost paternal #interest# to #one# of the principal composers of the #day# who excited her to spare no pains in the cultivation of her #voice# which might hereafter prove a source of wealth and independence
but this counsel effectually decided $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ never to commit herself by being seen in public with #one# destined for a theatrical #life# and acting upon this principle the #banker# #daughter# though perfectly willing to allow $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ armilly that was the #name# of the young virtuosa to practice with her through the #day# took especial #care# not to be seen in her company
still though not actually received at the hôtel $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ in the #light# of an acknowledged #friend# $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ was treated with far more kindness and consideration than is usually bestowed on a governess
the curtain fell almost immediately after the entrance of #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ into her #box# the band quitted the orchestra for the accustomed #half# #hour# interval allowed between the acts and the audience were left at #liberty# to promenade the salon or lobbies or to pay and receive #visit# in their respective #box#
her nose was precisely what a sculptor would have chosen for a chiselled juno $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and $baron_de_château_renaud$ were amongst the first to avail themselves of this permission
for an #instant# the #idea# struck #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ that this eagerness on the #part# of the young viscount arose from his impatience to join her party and she whispered her expectations to her #daughter# that $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was hurrying to pay his respects to them
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ however merely returned a dissenting movement of the #head# while with a cold #smile# she directed the #attention# of her #mother# to an opposite #box# on the first circle in which sat the #countess# and where $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had just made his #appearance#
so we meet again my travelling #friend# do we cried the #countess# extending her #hand# to him with all the warmth and cordiality of an old acquaintance it was really very good of you to recognize me so quickly and still more so to bestow your first #visit# on me
be assured replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ that if i had been aware of your arrival in paris and had known your address i should have paid my respects to you before this
allow me to introduce my #friend# $baron_de_château_renaud$ #one# of the few true #gentleman# now to be found in france and from whom i have just learned that you were a spectator of the races in the champ de mars #yesterday#
$baron_de_château_renaud$ bowed to the #countess# so you were at the races #baron# inquired the #countess# eagerly
yes #madame# well then pursued #madame# with considerable animation you can probably tell me who won the jockey club stakes
i am sorry to say i cannot replied the #baron# and i was just asking the same #question# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$
are you very anxious to know #countess# asked $m_albert_de_morcerf$ to know what the #name# of the owner of the winning #horse#
excessively only imagine but do tell me viscount whether you really are acquainted with it or no i beg your pardon #madame# but you were about to relate some #story# were you not
you must know i felt so interested in the splendid roan #horse# with his elegant little rider so tastefully dressed in a pink satin jacket and cap that i could not help praying for their success with as much earnestness as though the #half# of my #fortune# were at stake and when i saw them outstrip all the #other# and come to the winning post in such gallant style i actually clapped my #hand# with #joy#
imagine my surprise when upon returning home the first object i met on the #staircase# was the identical jockey in the pink jacket
i concluded that by some singular #chance# the owner of the winning #horse# must live in the same hotel as myself but as i entered my #apartment# i beheld the very #gold# cup awarded as a prize to the unknown #horse# and rider
you said only imagine and then paused pray continue well then listen inside the cup was a small #piece# of #paper# on which were written these #word# from $lord_ruthven$ to #countess#
precisely i was sure of it said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ sure of what that the owner of the #horse# was $lord_ruthven$ himself
what $lord_ruthven$ do you #mean# why our $lord_ruthven$ the vampire of the salle argentina is it possible
exclaimed the #countess# is he here in paris to be sure why not and you #visit# him meet him at your own $house_of_peers$ and elsewhere
i assure you he is my most intimate #friend# and de $baron_de_château_renaud$ has also the #honor# of his acquaintance
but why are you so sure of his being the winner of the jockey club prize was not the winning #horse# entered by the #name# of $luigi_vampa$
what of that why do you not recollect the #name# of the celebrated #bandit# by whom i was made #prisoner#
oh yes and from whose #hand# the #count# extricated me in so wonderful a #manner# to be sure i remember it all now
he called himself $luigi_vampa$ you see it evident where the #count# got the #name# but what could have been his motive for sending the cup to me
in the first #place# because i had spoken much of you to him as you may believe and in the second because he delighted to see a countrywoman take so lively an #interest# in his success
i trust and #hope# you never repeated to the #count# all the foolish remarks we used to make about him
i should not like to affirm upon oath that i have not besides his presenting you the cup under the #name# of $lord_ruthven$
oh but that is dreadful why the #man# must owe me a fearful grudge does his action appear like that of an #enemy#
no certainly not well then and so he is in paris yes and what #effect# does he produce
then the coronation of the queen of england took #place# followed by the theft of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ mars #diamond# and so #people# talked of #something# else
why said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he was talked about for a week my good #fellow# said $baron_de_château_renaud$ the #count# is your #friend# and you treat him accordingly
do not believe what $m_albert_de_morcerf$ is telling you #countess# so far from the sensation excited in the parisian circles by the #appearance# of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ having abated i take upon myself to declare that it is as strong as ever
his first astounding act upon coming amongst us was to present a pair of #horse# worth #franc# to #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ his second the almost miraculous preservation of #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #life# now it seems that he has carried off the prize awarded by the jockey club
i therefore maintain in #spite# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ that not only is the #count# the object of #interest# at this present #moment# but also that he #will# continue to be so for a #month# longer if he pleases to exhibit an eccentricity of conduct which after all may be his ordinary mode of existence
perhaps you are #right# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ meanwhile who is in the russian ambassador #box# which #box# do you #mean# asked the #countess#
the #one# between the pillars on the first tier it seems to have been fitted up entirely afresh
did you observe #anyone# during the first act asked $baron_de_château_renaud$ where in that #box# no replied the #countess#
it was certainly empty during the first act then resuming the #subject# of their previous #conversation# she said and so you really believe it was your mysterious #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ that gained the prize
i am sure of it and who afterwards sent the cup to me undoubtedly
do no such #thing# i beg of you he would only send you another formed of a magnificent sapphire or hollowed out of a gigantic ruby
but i dont know him said the #countess# i have a great #mind# to #return# it it is his #way# and you must take him as you find him
at this #moment# the bell rang to announce the #drawing# up of the curtain for the second act $m_albert_de_morcerf$ rose to #return# to his #place#
at the #end# of the next act with your permission i #will# come and inquire whether there is #anything# i can do for you in paris
pray take notice said the #countess# that my present residence is rue de rivoli and that i am at home to my #friend# every saturday #evening#
shall i see you again asked the #countess# so now you are both forewarned the young #man# bowed and quitted the #box#
upon reaching their stalls they found the whole of the audience in the parterre standing up and directing their gaze towards the #box# formerly possessed by the russian ambassador
a #man# of from thirty five to forty #year# of #age# dressed in deep black had just entered accompanied by a young #woman# dressed after the eastern style
the #lady# was surpassingly beautiful while the rich magnificence of her attire drew all #eye# upon her hullo said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
in a few #moment# the young #girl# had attracted the #attention# of the whole $house_of_peers$ and even the occupants of the #box# leaned forward to scrutinize her magnificent #diamond#
it is $m_de_monte_cristo$ and his greek the #stranger# were indeed no #other# than the #count# and $haydée$ the second act passed away during #one# continued buzz of #voice#
intimating that some great and universally interesting #event# had occurred all #eye# all #thought# were occupied with the young and beautiful #woman# whose gorgeous apparel and splendid jewels made a most extraordinary spectacle
upon this occasion an unmistakable #sign# from #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ intimated her #desire# to see $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in her #box# directly the curtain fell on the second act and neither the politeness nor good taste of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ would permit his neglecting an invitation so unequivocally given
#one# deep whisper at the close of the act he therefore went to the #baroness# having bowed to the two #lady# he extended his #hand# to $m_lucien_debray$
by the #baroness# he was most graciously welcomed while $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ received him with her accustomed coldness my dear #fellow# said $m_lucien_debray$ you have come in the nick of #time#
there is #madame# overwhelming me with #question# respecting the #count# she insists upon it that i can tell her his birth education and parentage where he came from and whither he is going
being no disciple of cagliostro i was wholly unable to do this so by #way# of getting out of the scrape i said ask $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he has got the whole history of his beloved $m_de_monte_cristo$ at his #finger# #end# whereupon the #baroness# signified her #desire# to see you
is it not almost incredible said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ that a #person# having at least #half# a #million# of #secret# #service# #money# at his command should possess so little information
let me assure you #madame# said $m_lucien_debray$ that had i really the #sum# you mention at my disposal i would employ it more profitably than in troubling myself to obtain particulars respecting the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ whose only merit in my #eye# consists in his being twice as rich as a nabob
however i have turned the #business# over to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ so pray settle it with him as may be most agreeable to you for my own #part# i #care# #nothing# about the #count# or his mysterious doings
i am very sure no nabob would have sent me a pair of #horse# worth #franc# wearing on their #head# four #diamond# valued at #franc# each
and i verily believe that like potemkin he keeps his #pocket# filled for the sake of strewing them along the #road# as tom thumb did his flint #stone#
he seems to have a mania for #diamond# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ smiling
perhaps he has discovered some mine said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i suppose you know he has an #order# for unlimited credit on the #baron# banking establishment
and further that he stated to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ his intention of only staying a #year# in paris during which #time# he proposed to spend six #million#
i was not aware of it replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but i can readily believe it he must be the shah of persia travelling incog
i really never met with #one# #woman# so ready to do #justice# to the charms of another as yourself responded $m_lucien_debray$ raising his lorgnette to his #eye#
have you noticed the remarkable beauty of the young #woman# $m_lucien_debray$ inquired $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ a most lovely creature upon my soul was his verdict
who is this young #person# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ inquired $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ does anybody know $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ replying to this direct appeal
i can give you very exact information on that #subject# as well as on most #point# relative to the mysterious #person# of whom we are now conversing
so i should suppose by her dress if you know no more than that #everyone# here is as well informed as yourself
the young #woman# is a greek i am extremely sorry you find me so ignorant a cicerone
i do know #one# #thing# more namely that she is a musician for #one# #day# when i chanced to be breakfasting with the #count# i heard the #sound# of a guzla
replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but i am reluctantly obliged to confess i have #nothing# further to communicate yes stay it is impossible that it could have been touched by any #other# #finger# than her own
then your #count# entertains visitors does he asked #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ indeed he does and in a most lavish #manner# i can assure you
i must try and persuade $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to invite him to a ball or #dinner# or #something# of the #sort# that he may be compelled to ask us in #return#
what said $m_lucien_debray$ laughing do you really #mean# you would go to his $house_of_peers$ why not
you have ample #proof# to the #contrary# if you #look# opposite said the #baroness# as she laughingly pointed to the beautiful greek
my #husband# could accompany me but do you know this mysterious #count# is a bachelor no no
exclaimed $m_lucien_debray$ that #girl# is not his #wife# he told us himself she was his slave do you not recollect
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ his telling us so at your breakfast well then said the #baroness# if slave she be she has all the #air# and #manner# of a princess
of the arabian #night# if you like but tell me my dear $m_lucien_debray$ what it is that constitutes a princess
to me she seems overloaded observed $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ she would #look# far better if she wore fewer and we should then be able to see her finely formed throat and wrists
why #diamond# and she is covered with them see how the artist peeps out exclaimed #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
my poor $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ you must conceal your passion for the fine arts i admire all that is beautiful returned the young #lady#
what do you think of the #count# inquired $m_lucien_debray$ he is not much amiss according to my #idea# of good #look#
the #count# repeated $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ as though it had not occurred to her to observe him sooner the #count# oh he is so dreadfully pale
i quite agree with you said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and the #secret# of that very pallor is what we want to find out
the #countess# insists upon it that he is a vampire then the #countess# has returned to paris has she inquired the #baroness#
is that she mamma asked $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ almost opposite to us with that profusion of beautiful #light# #hair# yes said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ that is she
shall i tell you what you ought to do $m_albert_de_morcerf$ command me #madame# well then you should go and bring your #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ to us
what for asked $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ what for why to converse with him of #course# have you really no #desire# to meet him
none whatever replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ strange #child# murmured the #baroness# he #will# very probably come of his own accord said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
there do you see #madame# he recognizes you and bows the #baroness# returned the salute in the most smiling and graceful #manner#
well said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i may as well be magnanimous and #tear# myself away to forward your #wish# adieu i #will# go and try if there are any #mean# of speaking to him
go straight to his #box# that #will# be the simplest #plan# but i have never been presented
presented to whom to the beautiful greek you say she is only a slave while you assert that she is a queen or at least a princess
no i #hope# that when he sees me leave you he #will# come out that is possible go
i am going said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ as he made his parting bow just as he was passing the #count# #box# the #door# opened and $m_de_monte_cristo$ came forth
after giving some directions to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ who stood in the lobby the #count# took $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #arm# carefully closing the #box# #door# $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ placed himself before it while a crowd of spectators assembled round the nubian
see that cluster of #person# collected around poor $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ who is as much astonished as themselves really #one# might suppose he was the only nubian they had ever beheld
now i can #promise# you that a frenchman might show himself in public either in tunis constantinople bagdad or cairo without being treated in that #way#
upon my #word# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ paris is a strange city and the parisians a very singular #people#
that shows that the eastern nations have too much good sense to waste their #time# and #attention# on objects undeserving of either
however as far as $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ is concerned i can assure you the #interest# he excites is merely from the #circumstance# of his being your attendant
you who are at this #moment# the most celebrated and fashionable #person# in paris really and what has procured me so flattering a distinction
you give away #horse# worth a thousand $louis_xviii$ you save the #life# of #lady# of high rank and beauty under the #name# of major black you run thoroughbreds ridden by tiny urchins not larger than marmots then when you have carried off the golden trophy of victory instead of setting any value on it you give it to the first handsome #woman# you think of
what why yourself to be sure and who has filled your #head# with all this nonsense
why in the first #place# i heard it from #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who by the by is dying to see you in her #box# or to have you seen there by #other# secondly i learned it from $m_beauchamp$ journal and thirdly from my own imagination
why if you sought concealment did you call your #horse# $luigi_vampa$ that was an oversight certainly replied the #count#
but tell me does the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ never #visit# the opera i have been looking for him but without success
he #will# be here tonight in what #part# of the $house_of_peers$ in the #baroness# #box# i believe
that charming young #woman# with her is her #daughter# yes i congratulate you $m_albert_de_morcerf$ smiled
we #will# discuss that #subject# at #length# some future #time# said he but what do you think of the music
oh it is well enough as the production of a human composer sung by featherless bipeds to quote the late diogenes
from which it would seem my dear #count# that you can at #pleasure# enjoy the seraphic strains that proceed from the seven choirs of paradise
you are #right# in some degree when i #wish# to listen to #sound# more exquisitely attuned to melody than mortal ear ever yet listened to i go to sleep
what music why the music you have been listening to
then sleep here my dear #count# the conditions are favorable what else was opera invented for no #thank# you
your orchestra is too noisy to sleep after the #manner# i speak of absolute calm and #silence# are necessary and then a certain preparation
i know the famous hashish precisely so my dear viscount whenever you #wish# to be regaled with music come and sup with me
i have already enjoyed that treat when breakfasting with you said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ do you #mean# at rome
ah then i suppose you heard $haydée$ guzla the poor exile frequently beguiles a weary #hour# in playing over to me the #air# of her native land
i do $m_albert_de_morcerf$ did not pursue the #subject# and $m_de_monte_cristo$ himself fell into a silent reverie
the bell rang at this #moment# for the rising of the curtain you #will# excuse my leaving you said the #count# turning in the direction of his #box#
what are you going pray say #everything# that is kind to #countess# on the #part# of her #friend# the vampire
and what message shall i convey to the #baroness# that with her permission i shall do myself the #honor# of paying my respects in the #course# of the #evening#
the third act had begun and during its progress the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ according to his #promise# made his #appearance# in the #box# of #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was not a #person# to excite either #interest# or curiosity in a #place# of public amusement his #presence# therefore was wholly unnoticed save by the occupants of the #box# in which he had just seated himself
the quick #eye# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ however marked his coming and a slight though meaning #smile# passed over his #lip#
$haydée$ whose soul seemed centred in the #business# of the stage like all unsophisticated #nature# delighted in whatever addressed itself to the #eye# or ear
mesdemoiselles noblet julia and leroux executed the customary pirouettes robert duly challenged the prince of granada and the royal #father# of the princess isabella taking his #daughter# by the #hand# swept round the stage with majestic strides the better to display the rich folds of his velvet robe and mantle
the third act passed off as usual after which the curtain again fell and the spectators poured forth from the theatre into the lobbies and salon
the #count# left his #box# and a #moment# later was saluting the baronne $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who could not restrain a #cry# of mingled #pleasure# and surprise
you are welcome #count# she exclaimed as he entered i have been most anxious to see you that i might repeat orally the #thank# writing
can so ill express surely so trifling a #circumstance# cannot deserve a #place# in your remembrance believe me #madame# i had entirely forgotten it
but it is not so easy to forget $monsieur_cavalcanti$ that the very next #day# after your princely gift you saved the #life# of my dear #friend# #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ which was endangered by the very animals your generosity restored to me
this #time# at least i do not deserve your #thank# it was $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ my nubian slave who rendered this #service# to #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
was it $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ asked the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who rescued my #son# from the #hand# of #bandit# no #count# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ taking the #hand# held out to him by the general
in this instance i may fairly and freely accept your #thank# but you have already tendered them and fully discharged your debt
if indeed there existed #one# and i feel almost mortified to find you still reverting to the #subject# may i beg of you #baroness# to #honor# me with an introduction to your #daughter#
oh you are no #stranger# at least not by #name# replied #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and the last two or three #day# we have really talked of #nothing#
but you $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ continued the #baroness# turning towards her #daughter# this is the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ the #count# bowed while $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ bent her #head# slightly
you have a charming young #person# with you tonight #count# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is she your #daughter# no $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said $m_de_monte_cristo$ astonished at the coolness and freedom of the #question#
she is a poor unfortunate greek left under my #care# and what is her #name# $haydée$ replied $m_de_monte_cristo$
and tell me did you ever see at the #court# of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ tepelini whom you so gloriously and valiantly served a more exquisite beauty or richer #costume#
a greek murmured the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ yes indeed #count# said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ did i hear rightly $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said $m_de_monte_cristo$ that you served at $ali_pasha_of_yanina$
and it is no #secret# that i owe my #fortune# such as it is to the liberality of the illustrious albanese chief
i was #inspector# general of the pasha troops replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but #look# exclaimed #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ where
there said $m_de_monte_cristo$ placing his #arm# around the #count# and leaning with him over the front of the #box# just as $haydée$ whose #eye# were occupied in examining the theatre in search of her guardian perceived his pale #feature# close to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #face#
she bent forwards as though to assure herself of the reality of what she saw then uttering a faint #cry# threw herself back in her #seat#
stammered $m_albert_de_morcerf$ it was as if the young #girl# beheld the #head# of medusa the #sound# was heard by the #people# about $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ who instantly opened the #box# #door#
why #count# exclaimed $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ what has happened to your ward she seems to have been taken suddenly ill very probably answered the #count#
but do not be alarmed on her #account# $haydée$ nervous system is delicately organized and she is peculiarly susceptible to the odors even of flowers
nay there are some which cause her to faint if brought into her #presence# however continued $m_de_monte_cristo$ #drawing# a small phial from his #pocket# i have an infallible remedy
so saying he bowed to the #baroness# and her #daughter# exchanged a parting shake of the #hand# with $m_lucien_debray$ and the #count# and left #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #box#
upon his #return# to $haydée$ he found her still very pale as soon as she saw him she seized his #hand# her own #hand# were moist and icy cold
who was it you were talking with over there she asked with the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ answered $m_de_monte_cristo$
exclaimed $haydée$ her #eye# flashing with rage he sold my #father# to the turks and the #fortune# he boasts of was the price of his treachery
he tells me he served your illustrious #father# and that he owes his #fortune# to him wretch did not you know that
my dear lord #something# of this i heard in epirus said $m_de_monte_cristo$ but the particulars are still unknown to me
you shall relate them to me my #child# they are no #doubt# both curious and interesting yes yes but let us go
so saying $haydée$ arose and wrapping herself in her burnouse of white cashmere embroidered with pearls and coral she hastily quitted the #box# at the #moment# when the curtain was rising upon the fourth act
i feel as though it would kill me to remain long near that dreadful #man# do you observe said the #countess# to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who had returned to her #side#
that #man# does #nothing# like #other# #people# he listens most devoutly to the third act of robert le diable and when the fourth begins takes his departure
some #day# after this meeting $m_albert_de_morcerf$ visited the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ at his $house_of_peers$ in the champs élysées which had already assumed that palace like #appearance# which the #count# princely #fortune# enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences
he came to renew the #thank# of #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ which had been already conveyed to the #count# through the medium of a #letter# signed baronne $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ née $hermine$ de servieux
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ was accompanied by $m_lucien_debray$ who joining in his #friend# #conversation# added some passing compliments the source of which the #count# talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess
he was convinced that $m_lucien_debray$ #visit# was due to a double #feeling# of curiosity the larger #half# of which sentiment emanated from the rue de la chaussée antin
#chapter# a flurry in stocks in short #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ not being able personally to examine in detail
the domestic economy and household arrangements of a #man# who gave away #horse# worth #franc# and who went to the opera with a greek slave wearing #diamond# to the amount of a #million# of #money# had deputed those #eye# by which she was accustomed to see to give her a faithful #account# of the mode of #life# of this incomprehensible #person#
but the #count# did not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection between $m_lucien_debray$ #visit# and the curiosity of the #baroness#
you are in constant communication with the #baron# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ the #count# inquired of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ yes #count# you know what i told you
it is more than ever a settled #thing# said $m_lucien_debray$ and considering that this remark was all that he was at that #time# called upon to make he adjusted the #glass# to his #eye# and biting the top of his #gold# headed cane began to make the tour of the #apartment# examining the #arm# and the pictures
all remains the same then in that #quarter# ah said $m_de_monte_cristo$ i did not expect that the #affair# would be so promptly concluded
while we are forgetting them they are falling into their appointed #order# and when again our #attention# is directed to them we are surprised at the progress they have made towards the proposed #end#
my #father# and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ served together in spain my #father# in the army and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ in the commissariat department
it was there that my #father# ruined by the revolution and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who never had possessed any patrimony both laid the foundations of their different #fortune#
i think $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ mentioned that in a #visit# which i paid him and continued he casting a #side# #glance# at $m_lucien_debray$ who was turning over the leaves of an album
oh #thing# take their #course# without our assistance yes said $m_de_monte_cristo$ $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is pretty
very pretty or rather very beautiful replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but of that style of beauty which i do not appreciate i am an ungrateful #fellow#
i think i remember that to be her #name# you speak as if you were already her #husband#
really said $m_de_monte_cristo$ lowering his #voice# you do not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the #subject# of this #marriage#
ah returned $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in his #turn# looking around to see what $m_lucien_debray$ was doing $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is too rich for me replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and that frightens me
my #father# income is about #franc# per annum and he #will# give me perhaps ten or twelve thousand when i marry
bah exclaimed $m_de_monte_cristo$ that a fine #reason# to give are you not rich yourself
but #everything# does not depend on wealth and it is a fine #thing# to have a good #name# and to occupy a high station in society
your #name# is celebrated your #position# magnificent and then the comte de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ is a #soldier# and it is pleasing to see the integrity of a bayard united to the poverty of a duguesclin disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword can shine
as for me i consider the union with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ a most suitable #one# she #will# enrich you and you #will# ennoble her
that perhaps might not be considered a large #sum# in paris especially said the #count# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ shook his #head# and looked thoughtful
i confess observed $m_de_monte_cristo$ that i have some difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young #lady# who is both rich and beautiful
there is still #something# else said he oh said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ this repugnance if repugnance it may be called is not all on my #side#
it is my #mother# who dissents she has a clear and penetrating judgment and does not #smile# on the proposed union
whence can it arise then for you told me your #father# desired the #marriage# i cannot #account# for it but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
ah said the #count# in a somewhat forced #tone# that may be easily explained the comtesse de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who is aristocracy and refinement itself does not relish the #idea# of being allied by your #marriage# with #one# of ignoble birth that is natural enough
i do not know if that is her #reason# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but #one# #thing# i do know that if this #marriage# be consummated it #will# render her quite miserable
there was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in #order# to talk over and settle the #affair# but i had such a sudden attack of indisposition
real interrupted the #count# smiling oh real enough from anxiety doubtless at any rate they postponed the #matter# for two #month#
there is no hurry you know i am not yet twenty #one# and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is only seventeen but the two #month# expire next week
it must be done my dear #count# you cannot imagine how my #mind# is harassed how happy you are in being exempt from all this
well and why should not you be free too what prevents you from being so oh it #will# be too great a disappointment to my #father# if i do not marry $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
marry her then said the #count# with a significant shrug of the #shoulder# yes replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but that #will# plunge my #mother# into positive #grief#
i #will# try and think over what is the best #thing# to be done you #will# give me your advice #will# you not and if possible extricate me from my unpleasant #position#
then do not marry her said the #count# well i shall see i think rather than give pain to my dear #mother# i would run the risk of offending the #count#
ah said he to $m_lucien_debray$ who had thrown himself into an easy #chair# at the farthest extremity of the salon and who held a pencil in his #right# #hand# and an #account# book in his left what are you doing there
$m_de_monte_cristo$ turned away he seemed moved by this last remark are you making a sketch after poussin
oh no was the tranquil response i am too fond of art to attempt #anything# of that #sort# i am doing a little #sum# in arithmetic
i am calculating what the $house_of_peers$ of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ must have gained by the last rise in haiti bonds from they have risen to in three #day# and the prudent #banker# had purchased at therefore he must have made livres
in arithmetic yes i am calculating by the #way# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ that indirectly concerns you that is not his biggest scoop said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ did he not make a #million# in spaniards this last #year#
my dear #fellow# said $m_lucien_debray$ here is the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ who #will# say to you as the italians do
denaro santità metà della metà when they tell me such #thing# i only shrug my #shoulder# and say #nothing#
but you were speaking of haitians said $m_de_monte_cristo$ ah haitians that is quite another #thing# haitians are the écarté of french stock jobbing
we may like bouillotte delight in whist be enraptured with boston and yet grow tired of them all but we always come back to écarté it is not only a game it is a hors œuvre
had he but waited till #today# the price would have fallen to and instead of gaining #franc# he would have lost or
m $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ sold #yesterday# at and #pocket# #franc# and what has caused the sudden fall from to asked $m_de_monte_cristo$
i am profoundly ignorant of all these stock jobbing intrigues because said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ laughing #one# #piece# of news follows another and there is often great dissimilarity between them
i see that $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is accustomed to play at gaining or losing #franc# in a #day# he must be enormously rich
ah said the #count# it is not he who plays exclaimed $m_lucien_debray$ it is #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ she is indeed daring
but you who are a reasonable being $m_lucien_debray$ and who knows how little dependence is to be placed on the news since you are at the fountain #head# surely you ought to prevent it said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with a #smile#
how can i if her #husband# fails in controlling her asked $m_lucien_debray$ you know the character of the #baroness#
no #one# has any influence with her and she does precisely what she pleases ah if i were in your #place# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
well i would reform her it would be rendering a #service# to her future #son# in #law# how would you set about it
ah that would be easy enough i would give her a lesson a lesson yes
your #position# as secretary to the #minister# renders your authority great on the #subject# of political news you never open your mouth but the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your #word#
cause her to lose a hundred thousand #franc# and that would teach her prudence i do not understand stammered $m_lucien_debray$
it is very clear notwithstanding replied the young #man# with an artlessness wholly free from affectation tell her some fine #morning#
an unheard of #piece# of intelligence some telegraphic despatch of which you alone are in #possession# for instance that henri iv was seen #yesterday# at gabrielle
that would boom the market she #will# buy heavily and she #will# certainly lose when $m_beauchamp$ announces the following #day# in his gazette
the report circulated by some usually well informed #person# that the #king# was seen #yesterday# at gabrielle $house_of_peers$ is totally without foundation
$m_de_monte_cristo$ although apparently indifferent had not lost #one# #word# of this #conversation# and his penetrating #eye# had even read a hidden #secret# in the embarrassed #manner# of the secretary
we can positively assert that his majesty did not quit the pont neuf $m_lucien_debray$ #half# smiled this embarrassment had completely escaped $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but it caused $m_lucien_debray$ to shorten his #visit# he was evidently ill at ease
the #count# in taking leave of him said #something# in a low #voice# to which he answered willingly #count# i accept
do you not think on reflection said he to him that you have done wrong in thus speaking of your #mother# in #law# in the #presence# of $m_lucien_debray$
the #count# returned to young $m_albert_de_morcerf$ my dear #count# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i beg of you not to apply that title so prematurely
so much so that the #baroness# very rarely comes to the $house_of_peers$ and my #mother# has not i think visited #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ twice in her whole #life#
now speaking without any exaggeration is your #mother# really so very much averse to this #marriage#
m $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is my #banker# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ has overwhelmed me with politeness in #return# for a #service# which a casual #piece# of good #fortune# enabled me to render him
then said the #count# i am emboldened to speak openly to you i predict from all this an avalanche of #dinner# and routs
now in #order# not to presume on this and also to be beforehand with them i have if agreeable to you #thought# of inviting and #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and and #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ to my #country# $house_of_peers$ at $auteuil$
if i were to invite you and the #count# and #countess# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ to this #dinner# i should give it the #appearance# of being a matrimonial meeting or at least #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ would #look# upon the #affair# in that #light# especially if #baron# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ did me the #honor# to bring his #daughter#
in that #case# your #mother# would hold me in aversion and i do not at all #wish# that on the #contrary# i #desire# to stand high in her esteem
i #thank# you sincerely for having used so much candor towards me and i gratefully accept the exclusion which you propose
indeed #count# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ you say you #desire# my #mother# good #opinion# i assure you it is already yours to a very unusual extent
do you think so said $m_de_monte_cristo$ with #interest# oh i am sure of it we talked of you an #hour# after you left us the #other# #day#
but to #return# to what we were saying if my #mother# could know of this #attention# on your #part# and i #will# venture to tell her
i am sure that she #will# be most grateful to you it is true that my #father# #will# be equally angry
but i think your #father# #will# not be the only angry #one# and #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #will# think me a very ill mannered #person#
the #count# laughed well said he to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ they know that i am intimate with you that you are
in #fact# #one# of the oldest of my parisian acquaintances and they #will# not find you at my $house_of_peers$ they #will# certainly ask me why i did not invite you
be sure to provide yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a semblance of probability and communicate the #fact# to me by a #line# in writing
you know that with #banker# #nothing# but a written document #will# be valid i #will# do better than that said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
my #mother# is wishing to go to the #sea# #side# what #day# is fixed for your #dinner# saturday this is tuesday well #tomorrow# #evening# we leave and the #day# after we shall be at tréport
indeed you give me more credit than i deserve i only #wish# to do what #will# be agreeable to you that is all
really #count# you have a delightful #way# of setting #people# at their ease when shall you send your invitations
this very #day# well i #will# immediately call on $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and tell him that my #mother# and myself must leave paris #tomorrow#
i have not seen you consequently i know #nothing# of your #dinner# how foolish you are have you forgotten that $m_lucien_debray$ has just seen you at my $house_of_peers$
i have seen you and invited you without any ceremony when you instantly answered that it would be impossible for you to accept as you were going to tréport
ah true fix it this #way# well then that is settled but you #will# come and call on my #mother# before #tomorrow#
before #tomorrow# that #will# be a difficult #matter# to arrange besides i shall just be in the #way# of all the preparations for departure
well you can do better you were only a charming #man# before but if you accede to my proposal you #will# be adorable
you are #today# free as #air# come and dine with me we shall be a small party only yourself my #mother# and i
what must i do to attain such sublimity you have scarcely seen my #mother# you shall have an opportunity of observing her more closely
she is a remarkable #woman# and i only regret that there does not exist another like her about twenty #year# younger
in that #case# i assure you there would very soon be a #countess# and viscountess of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ as to my #father# you #will# not see him he is officially engaged and dines with the chief referendary
you shall tell us the history of the beautiful greek who was with you the #other# #night# at the opera and whom you call your slave and yet treat like a princess
we #will# talk over our travels and you who have seen the whole #world# #will# relate your adventures we #will# talk italian and spanish
a thousand #thank# said the #count# your invitation is most gracious and i regret exceedingly that it is not in my #power# to accept it
come accept my invitation and my #mother# #will# #thank# you i am not so much at #liberty# as you suppose on the #contrary# i have a most important engagement
ah take #care# you were teaching me just now how in #case# of an invitation to #dinner# #one# might creditably make an excuse
i require the #proof# of a pre engagement i am not a #banker# like $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ but i am quite as incredulous as he is
i am going to give you a #proof# replied the #count# and he rang the bell humph said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
this is the second #time# you have refused to dine with my #mother# it is evident that you #wish# to avoid her
$m_de_monte_cristo$ started oh you do not #mean# that said he besides here comes the confirmation of my assertion
$monsieur_baptistin$ entered and remained standing at the #door# i had no previous knowledge of your #visit# had i
indeed you are such an extraordinary #person# that i would not #answer# for it at all #event# i could not guess that you would invite me to #dinner#
probably not well listen $monsieur_baptistin$ what did i tell you this #morning# when i called you into my laboratory
to close the #door# against visitors as soon as the clock struck five replied the #valet# what then
no no i #wish# to do away with that mysterious reputation that you have given me my dear viscount it is tiresome to be always acting manfred
ah my dear #count# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i #wish# my #life# to be free and open go on $monsieur_baptistin$
major $bartolomeo_cavalcanti$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ a #man# who ranks amongst the most ancient nobility of italy whose #name# dante has celebrated in the tenth canto of the inferno
then to admit no #one# except major $bartolomeo_cavalcanti$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ and his #son# you hear you remember it do you not
then there is his #son# $andrea_rondolo$ a charming young #man# about your own #age# viscount bearing the same title as yourself and who is making his entry into the parisian #world# aided by his #father#
the major #will# bring his #son# with him this #evening# the contino as we say in italy he confides him to my #care#
#million# if he proves himself worthy of it i #will# do what i can to advance his #interest# you #will# assist me in the #work# #will# you not
he is a perfect nobleman very polite modest and agreeable such as may be found constantly in italy descendants of very ancient #family#
i have met him several #time# at florence bologna and lucca and he has now communicated to me the #fact# of his arrival in paris
the acquaintances #one# makes in travelling have a #sort# of claim on #one# they everywhere expect to receive the same #attention# which you once paid them by #chance# as though the civilities of a passing #hour# were likely to awaken any lasting #interest# in favor of the #man# in whose society you may happen to be thrown in the #course# of your journey
this good major $monsieur_cavalcanti$ is come to take a second view of paris which he only saw in passing through in the #time# of the empire when he was on his #way# to moscow
i shall give him a good #dinner# he #will# confide his #son# to my #care# i #will# #promise# to watch over him i shall let him follow in whatever path his folly may lead him and then i shall have done my #part#
most undoubtedly this major $monsieur_cavalcanti$ is an old #friend# of yours then by no #mean# certainly i see you are a model mentor said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
good bye we shall #return# on sunday by the #way# i have received news of $m_franz_de_quesnel$ have you is he still amusing himself in italy
i believe so however he regrets your absence extremely he says you were the sun of rome and that without you all appears dark and cloudy
i do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it rains
his #opinion# of me is altered for the better then no he still persists in looking upon you as the most incomprehensible and mysterious of beings
and i felt a lively #interest# in him the very first #evening# of my introduction when i met him in search of a supper and prevailed upon him to accept a portion of mine
he is a charming young #man# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ he is i think the #son# of general épinay
he is the same who was so shamefully assassinated in by the bonapartists yes
really i like him extremely is there not also a matrimonial engagement contemplated for him yes he is to marry $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
indeed and you know i am to marry $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ laughing you #smile#
i #smile# because there appears to me to be about as much inclination for the consummation of the engagement in #question# as there is for my own
yes why do you do so but really my dear #count# we are talking as much of #woman# as they do of us it is unpardonable
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ rose are you going really that is a good #idea# two #hour# have i been boring you to #death# with my company and
then you with the greatest politeness ask me if i am going indeed #count# you are the most polished #man# in the #world#
and your #servant# too how very well behaved they are there is quite a style about them $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $monsieur_baptistin$ especially i could never get such a #man# as that
my #servant# seem to imitate those you sometimes see in a play who because they have only a #word# or two to say aquit themselves in the most awkward #manner# possible
that is not all give my compliments to your illustrious luccanese cavalcante of the $monsieur_cavalcanti$ and if by any #chance# he should be wishing to establish his #son# find him a #wife# very rich very noble on her #mother# #side# at least and a #baroness# in #right# of her #father# i #will# help you in the search
therefore if you #part# with $monsieur_baptistin$ give me the refusal of him by all #mean#
ah ha you #will# do as much as that #will# you yes well really #nothing# is certain in this #world#
oh #count# what a #service# you might render me i should like you a hundred #time# better if by your intervention i could manage to remain a bachelor even were it only for ten #year#
#nothing# is impossible gravely replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ and taking leave of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he returned into the $house_of_peers$ and struck the gong three #time#
$m_bertuccio$ appeared $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_bertuccio$ you understand that i intend entertaining company on saturday at $auteuil$ $m_bertuccio$ slightly started
i shall require your #service# to see that all be properly arranged it is a beautiful $house_of_peers$ or at all #event# may be made so
there must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title your #excellency# for the tapestried hangings are very old
let them all be taken away and changed then with the exception of the sleeping #chamber# which is hung with red damask you #will# leave that exactly as it is
you #will# not touch the #garden# either as to the yard you may do what you please with it i should prefer that being altered beyond all recognition
$m_bertuccio$ bowed i #will# do #everything# in my #power# to carry out your #wish# your #excellency#
i should be glad however to receive your #excellency# commands concerning the #dinner# really my dear $m_bertuccio$
said the #count# since you have been in paris you have become quite nervous and apparently out of your element you no longer seem to understand me
but surely your #excellency# #will# be so good as to inform me whom you are expecting to receive
i do not yet know myself neither is it necessary that you should do so lucullus dines with lucullus that is quite sufficient
both the #count# and $monsieur_baptistin$ had told the #truth# when they announced to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ the proposed #visit# of the major which had served $m_de_monte_cristo$ as a pretext for declining $m_albert_de_morcerf$ invitation
seven clock had just struck and $m_bertuccio$ according to the command which had been given him had two #hour# before left for $auteuil$ when a cab stopped at the #door# and after depositing its occupant at the #gate# immediately hurried away as if ashamed of its employment
the visitor was about fifty two #year# of #age# dressed in #one# of the green surtouts ornamented with black frogs which have so long maintained their popularity all over europe
he wore trousers of blue cloth boots tolerably clean but not of the brightest polish and a little too thick in the soles buckskin gloves a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes and a black cravat striped with white which if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free #will# might have passed for a halter so much did it resemble #one#
such was the picturesque #costume# of the #person# who rang at the #gate# and demanded if it was not at no in the avenue des champs élysées that the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ lived and who being answered by the porter in the affirmative entered closed the #gate# after him and began to ascend the #step#
the small and angular #head# of this #man# his white #hair# and thick gray moustaches caused him to be easily recognized by $monsieur_baptistin$ who had received an exact description of the expected visitor and who was awaiting him in the hall
$m_bertuccio$ bowed and left the #room# #chapter# major $monsieur_cavalcanti$ therefore scarcely had the #stranger# #time# to pronounce his #name# before the #count# was apprised of his arrival
he was ushered into a simple and elegant #drawing# #room# and the #count# rose to meet him with a smiling #air#
ah my dear #sir# you are most welcome i was expecting you indeed said the italian was your #excellency# then aware of my #visit#
yes i had been told that i should see you #today# at seven clock then you have received full information concerning my arrival
of #course# ah so much the better i feared this little precaution might have been forgotten m
what precaution that of informing you beforehand of my coming oh no it has not
but you are sure you are not mistaken very sure it really was i whom your #excellency# expected at seven clock this #evening#
i #will# prove it to you beyond a #doubt# oh no never #mind# that said the italian
it is not worth the trouble yes yes said $m_de_monte_cristo$ his visitor appeared slightly uneasy let me see said the #count# are you not the marquis $bartolomeo_cavalcanti$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$
$bartolomeo_cavalcanti$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ joyfully replied the italian yes i am really he ex major in the austrian #service# was i a major
timidly asked the old #soldier# yes said $m_de_monte_cristo$ you were a major that is the title the french give to the post which you filled in italy
very good said the major i do not demand more you understand your #visit# here #today# is not of your own suggestion is it said $m_de_monte_cristo$
no certainly not you were sent by some #other# #person# yes by the excellent $abbé_busoni$
exactly so said the delighted major and you have a #letter# yes there it is give it to me then
the major looked at the #count# with his large staring #eye# and then took a survey of the #apartment# but his gaze almost immediately reverted to the proprietor of the #room#
and $m_de_monte_cristo$ took the #letter# which he opened and read yes yes i see major $monsieur_cavalcanti$ a worthy patrician of lucca a descendant of the $monsieur_cavalcanti$ of florence continued $m_de_monte_cristo$ reading aloud
possessing an income of #half# a #million# $m_de_monte_cristo$ raised his #eye# from the #paper# and bowed #half# a #million# said he magnificent
yes in so many #word# and it must be so for the #abbé# knows correctly the amount of all the largest #fortune# in europe
be it #half# a #million# then but on my #word# of #honor# i had no #idea# that it was so much
#half# a #million# is it said the major because you are robbed by your steward
you must make some reformation in that #quarter# you have opened my #eye# said the italian gravely i #will# show the #gentleman# the #door#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ resumed the perusal of the #letter# and who only needs #one# #thing# more to make him happy
yes indeed but #one# said the major with a sigh which is to recover a lost and adored #son#
a lost and adored #son# stolen away in his infancy either by an #enemy# of his noble #family# or by the gypsies
at the #age# of five #year# said the major with a deep sigh and raising his #eye# to heaven
i have given him renewed #life# and #hope# in the assurance that you have the #power# of restoring the #son# whom he has vainly sought for fifteen #year#
unhappy #father# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ the #count# continued the major looked at the #count# with an indescribable #expression# of anxiety
i have the #power# of so doing said $m_de_monte_cristo$ the major recovered his self #possession# so then said he the #letter# was true to the #end#
no indeed certainly not a good #man# a #man# holding religious office as does the $abbé_busoni$ could not condescend to deceive or play off a joke but your #excellency# has not read all
did you #doubt# it my dear $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $bartolomeo_cavalcanti$ ah true said $m_de_monte_cristo$ there is a postscript
in #order# to save major $monsieur_cavalcanti$ the trouble of #drawing# on his #banker# i send him a draft for #franc# to defray his travelling expenses and credit on you for the further #sum# of #franc# which you still owe me
yes yes repeated the major yes there is a postscript the major awaited the conclusion of the postscript apparently with great anxiety
very good said the #count# he said very good muttered the major then #sir# replied he then what asked $m_de_monte_cristo$
then the postscript well what of the postscript then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the #rest# of the #letter#
i do not remember if it is exactly #franc# which i am still owing him but i dare say we shall not dispute the difference
certainly the $abbé_busoni$ and myself have a small #account# open between us you attached great importance then to this postscript my dear $monsieur_cavalcanti$
i must explain to you said the major that fully confiding in the signature of the $abbé_busoni$ i had not provided myself with any #other# funds so that if this resource had failed me i should have found myself very unpleasantly situated in paris
is it possible that a #man# of your standing should be embarrassed anywhere said $m_de_monte_cristo$ why really i know no #one# said the major
but then you yourself are known to #other# yes i am known so that proceed my dear $monsieur_cavalcanti$
so that you #will# remit to me these #franc# certainly at your first request the major #eye# dilated with pleasing #astonishment#
but sit down said $m_de_monte_cristo$ really i do not know what i have been thinking of i have positively kept you standing for the last #quarter# of an #hour#
dont mention it the major drew an armchair towards him and proceeded to #seat# himself now said the #count#
what #will# you take a #glass# of sherry port or alicante alicante if you please it is my favorite wine
i have some that is very good you #will# take a biscuit with it #will# you not yes i #will# take a biscuit as you are so obliging
$m_de_monte_cristo$ rang $monsieur_baptistin$ appeared the #count# advanced to meet him well said he in a low #voice#
the young #man# is here said the #valet# de chambre in the same #tone# into what #room# did you take him
into the blue #drawing# #room# according to your #excellency# #order# that #right# now bring the alicante and some biscuits
$monsieur_baptistin$ left the #room# really said the major i am quite ashamed of the trouble i am giving you
pray dont mention such a #thing# said the #count# $monsieur_baptistin$ re entered with #glass# wine and biscuits the #count# filled #one# #glass# but in the #other# he only poured a few drops of the ruby colored liquid
the bottle was covered with spiders webs and all the #other# #sign# which indicate the #age# of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a #man# #face#
the #count# told $monsieur_baptistin$ to leave the plate within reach of his #guest# who began by sipping the alicante with an #expression# of great satisfaction and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine
the major made a wise choice he took the full #glass# and a biscuit so #sir# you lived at lucca did you
you were rich noble held in great esteem had all that could render a #man# happy all said the major hastily swallowing his biscuit positively all
and yet there was #one# #thing# wanting in #order# to complete your #happiness# only #one# #thing# said the italian
and that #one# #thing# your lost #child# ah said the major taking a second biscuit that consummation of my #happiness# was indeed wanting
the worthy major raised his #eye# to heaven and sighed let me hear then said the #count# who this deeply regretted #son# was
for i always understood you were a bachelor that was the general #opinion# #sir# said the major and i
yes replied the #count# and you confirmed the report a youthful indiscretion i suppose which you were anxious to conceal from the #world# at large
the major recovered himself and resumed his usual calm #manner# at the same #time# casting his #eye# down either to give himself #time# to compose his #countenance# or to assist his imagination all the while giving an under #look# at the #count# the protracted #smile# on whose #lip# still announced the same polite curiosity
yes said the major i did #wish# this fault to be hidden from every #eye# not on your own #account# surely replied $m_de_monte_cristo$
for a #man# is above that #sort# of #thing# oh no certainly not on my own #account# said the major with a #smile# and a shake of the #head#
but for the sake of the #mother# said the #count# yes for the #mother# sake his poor #mother#
take some more wine my dear $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said the #count# pouring out for him a second #glass# of alicante your #emotion# has quite overcome you
his poor #mother# murmured the major trying to get the lachrymal gland in operation so as to moisten the #corner# of his #eye# with a false #tear#
cried the major taking a third biscuit she belonged to #one# of the first #family# in italy i think did she not
she was of a noble #family# of fiesole #count# and her #name# was do you #desire# to know her #name#
oh said $m_de_monte_cristo$ it would be quite superfluous for you to tell me for i already know it
the #count# knows #everything# said the italian bowing oliva corsinari was it not oliva corsinari
a marchioness a marchioness and you married her at last notwithstanding the opposition of her #family# yes that was the #way# it ended
and you have doubtless brought all your #paper# with you said $m_de_monte_cristo$ what #paper# the certificate of your #marriage# with oliva corsinari and the register of your #child# birth
the register of my #child# birth the register of the birth of $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ of your #son# is not his #name# $andrea_rondolo$
i believe so said the major what you believe so i dare not positively assert it as he has been lost for so long a #time#
your #excellency# i regret to say that not knowing it was necessary to come provided with these #paper# i neglected to bring them
well then said $m_de_monte_cristo$ you have all the documents with you that is unfortunate returned $m_de_monte_cristo$
were they then so necessary they were indispensable the major passed his #hand# across his #brow# ah perbacco indispensable were they
certainly they were supposing there were to be #doubt# raised as to the validity of your #marriage# or the legitimacy of your #child#
true said the major there might be #doubt# raised in that #case# your #son# would be very unpleasantly situated
it would be fatal to his #interest# it might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance
you must know that in france they are very particular on these #point# it is not sufficient as in italy to go to the #priest# and say we #love# each #other# and want you to marry us
#marriage# is a civil #affair# in france and in #order# to marry in an orthodox #manner# you must have #paper# which undeniably establish your identity
peccato that is the #misfortune# you see i have not these necessary #paper#
fortunately i have them though said $m_de_monte_cristo$ you yes you have them i have them
ah indeed said the major who seeing the object of his journey frustrated by the absence of the #paper# feared also that his forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the #franc# ah indeed that is a fortunate #circumstance# yes that really is lucky for it never occurred to me to bring them
i do not at all wonder at it #one# cannot think of #everything# but happily the $abbé_busoni$ #thought# for you
he is an excellent #person# he is extremely prudent and thoughtful he is an admirable #man# said the major
and he sent them to you here they are the major clasped his #hand# in token of admiration
you married oliva corsinari in the church of san paolo del monte cattini here is the #priest# certificate yes indeed there it is truly said the italian looking on with #astonishment#
and here is $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ baptismal register given by the curé of saravezza all quite correct take these documents then they do not concern me
you #will# give them to your #son# who #will# of #course# take great #care# of them i should think so indeed
if he were to lose them well and if he were to lose them said $m_de_monte_cristo$ in that #case# replied the major
it would be necessary to write to the curé for duplicates and it would be some #time# before they could be obtained
it would be a difficult #matter# to arrange said $m_de_monte_cristo$ almost an impossibility replied the major
i am very glad to see that you understand the value of these #paper# i regard them as invaluable
now said $m_de_monte_cristo$ as to the #mother# of the young #man# as to the #mother# of the young #man# repeated the italian with anxiety
as regards the marchesa corsinari really said the major difficulties seem to thicken upon us #will# she be wanted in any #way#
no #sir# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ besides has she not yes #sir# said the major she has m
paid the last debt of #nature# alas yes returned the italian i knew that said $m_de_monte_cristo$
and i am still mourning her loss exclaimed the major #drawing# from his #pocket# a checked handkerchief and alternately wiping first the left and then the #right# #eye#
she has been dead these ten #year# what would you have said $m_de_monte_cristo$ we are all mortal
now you understand my dear $monsieur_cavalcanti$ that it is useless for you to tell #people# in france that you have been separated from your #son# for fifteen #year#
#story# of gypsies who steal #child# are not at all in vogue in this #part# of the #world# and would not be believed
you sent him for his education to a college in #one# of the provinces and now you #wish# him to complete his education in the parisian #world#
that is the #reason# which has induced you to leave via reggio where you have lived since the #death# of your #wife#
that #will# be sufficient you think so certainly very well then if they should hear of the separation
ah yes what could i say that an unfaithful tutor bought over by the #enemy# of your #family#
by the corsinari precisely had stolen away this #child# in #order# that your #name# might become extinct that is reasonable since he is an only #son#
well now that all is arranged do not let these newly awakened remembrances be forgotten you have doubtless already guessed that i was preparing a surprise for you
an agreeable #one# asked the italian ah i see the #eye# of a #father# is no more to be deceived than his #heart#
hum said the major someone has told you the #secret# or perhaps you guessed that he was here
that who was here your #child# your #son# your $andrea_rondolo$ i did guess it replied the major with the greatest possible coolness
then he is here he is said $m_de_monte_cristo$ when the #valet# de chambre came in just now he told me of his arrival
ah very well very well said the major clutching the buttons of his coat at each exclamation my dear #sir# said $m_de_monte_cristo$
i #will# in the meantime go and prepare the young #man# for this much desired interview for i presume that he is not less impatient for it than yourself
i understand your #emotion# you must have #time# to recover yourself i should quite imagine that to be the #case# said $monsieur_cavalcanti$
well in a #quarter# of an #hour# he shall be with you you #will# bring him then you carry your goodness so far as even to present him to me yourself
but do not be uneasy even if the powerful #voice# of #nature# should be silent you cannot well mistake him he #will# enter by this #door#
he is a fine young #man# of fair complexion a little too fair perhaps pleasing in #manner# but you #will# see and judge for yourself
no i do not #wish# to come between a #father# and #son# your interview #will# be private by the #way# said the major
you know i have only the #franc# which the $abbé_busoni$ sent me this #sum# i have expended upon travelling expenses and
and you want #money# that is a #matter# of #course# my dear $monsieur_cavalcanti$ well here are #franc# on #account#
does your #excellency# #wish# for a receipt said the major at the same #time# slipping the #money# into the inner #pocket# of his coat
the major #eye# sparkled brilliantly it is #franc# which i now owe you said $m_de_monte_cristo$
for what said the #count# i #thought# you might want it to show the $abbé_busoni$ well when you receive the remaining you shall give me a receipt in full
between honest #man# such excessive precaution is i think quite unnecessary yes so it is between perfectly upright #people#
#one# #word# more said $m_de_monte_cristo$ say on you #will# permit me to make #one# remark
certainly pray do so then i should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress
it may be worn at via reggio but that #costume# however elegant in itself has long been out of fashion in paris
indeed said the major regarding himself with an #air# of complete satisfaction yes that unfortunate
oh if you really are attached to your old mode of dress you can easily resume it when you leave paris
but what shall i wear what you find in your trunks in my trunks i have but #one# portmanteau
i dare say you have #nothing# else with you what is the #use# of boring #one# self with so many #thing#
besides an old #soldier# always likes to march with as little baggage as possible that is just the #case#
precisely so but you are a #man# of foresight and prudence therefore you sent your luggage on before you
it has arrived at the hôtel des princes rue de richelieu it is there you are to take up your #quarter#
i presume you have given #order# to your #valet# de chambre to put in all you are likely to need your plain clothes and your uniform
then in these trunks on grand occasions you must wear your uniform that #will# #look# very well do not forget your crosses
they still laugh at them in france and yet always wear them for all that very well very well said the major who was in ecstasy at the #attention# paid him by the #count#
now said $m_de_monte_cristo$ that you have fortified yourself against all painful excitement prepare yourself my dear $monsieur_cavalcanti$ to meet your lost $andrea_rondolo$
saying which $m_de_monte_cristo$ bowed and disappeared behind the tapestry leaving the major fascinated beyond #expression# with the delightful reception which he had received at the #hand# of the #count#
the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ entered the adjoining #room# which $monsieur_baptistin$ had designated as the #drawing# #room# and found there a young #man# of graceful demeanor and elegant #appearance# who had arrived in a cab about #half# an #hour# previously
#chapter# $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $monsieur_baptistin$ had not found any difficulty in recognizing the #person# who presented himself at the #door# for admittance
he was certainly the tall young #man# with #light# #hair# red beard black #eye# and brilliant complexion whom his #master# had so particularly described to him
when the #count# entered the #room# the young #man# was carelessly stretched on a sofa tapping his boot with the #gold# headed cane which he held in his #hand#
on perceiving the #count# he rose quickly the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ i believe said he yes #sir# and i think i have the #honor# of addressing #count# $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$
#count# $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ repeated the young #man# accompanying his #word# with a bow you are charged with a #letter# of introduction addressed to me are you not said the #count#
i did not mention that because the signature seemed to me so strange the #letter# signed sinbad the #sailor# is it not
now as i have never known any sinbad with the exception of the #one# celebrated in the thousand and #one# #night#
well it is #one# of his descendants and a great #friend# of mine he is a very rich englishman eccentric almost to insanity and his real #name# is $lord_wilmore$
exactly so ah indeed then that explains #everything# that is extraordinary said $andrea_rondolo$ he is then the same englishman whom i met at
ah yes indeed well $monsieur_cavalcanti$ i am at your #service# if what you say be true replied the #count# smiling
perhaps you #will# be kind enough to give me some #account# of yourself and your #family# certainly i #will# do so said the young #man# with a quickness which gave #proof# of his ready invention
i am as you have said the #count# $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ #son# of major $bartolomeo_cavalcanti$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ a descendant of the $monsieur_cavalcanti$ whose #name# are inscribed in the golden book at florence
our #family# although still rich for my #father# income amounts to #half# a #million# has experienced many #misfortune# and i myself was at the #age# of five #year# taken away by the treachery of my tutor so that for fifteen #year# i have not seen the author of my existence
since i have arrived at #year# of discretion and become my own #master# i have been constantly seeking him but all in vain
at #length# i received this #letter# from your #friend# which states that my #father# is in paris and authorizes me to address myself to you for information respecting him
really all you have related to me is exceedingly interesting said $m_de_monte_cristo$ observing the young #man# with a gloomy satisfaction
and you have done well to conform in #everything# to the #wish# of my #friend# sinbad for your #father# is indeed here and is seeking you
the #count# from the #moment# of first entering the #drawing# #room# had not once lost #sight# of the #expression# of the young #man#
#countenance# he had admired the assurance of his #look# and the firmness of his #voice# but at these #word# so natural in themselves
your #father# is indeed here and is seeking you young $andrea_rondolo$ started and exclaimed my #father#
is my #father# here most undoubtedly replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ your #father# major $bartolomeo_cavalcanti$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ the #expression# of #terror# which for the #moment# had overspread the #feature# of the young #man# had now disappeared
ah yes that is the #name# certainly major $bartolomeo_cavalcanti$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ and you really #mean# to say $monsieur_cavalcanti$ that my dear #father# is here
the history which he related to me of his lost #son# touched me to the quick indeed his #grief# #hope# and #fear# on that #subject# might furnish material for a most touching and pathetic poem
at #length# he #one# #day# received a #letter# stating that the abductors of his #son# now offered to restore him or at least to give notice where he might be found on condition of receiving a large #sum# of #money# by #way# of ransom
your #father# did not hesitate an #instant# and the #sum# was sent to the frontier of piedmont with a passport signed for italy
yes #sir# and i can even add that i have only just left his company you were in the south of france i think
yes replied $andrea_rondolo$ with an embarrassed #air# i was in the south of france a #carriage# was to await you at nice
precisely so and it conveyed me from nice to genoa from genoa to turin from turin to chambéry from chambéry to pont de beauvoisin and from pont de beauvoisin to paris
then your #father# ought to have met with you on the #road# for it is exactly the same route which he himself took and that is how we have been able to trace your journey to this #place#
if my #father# had met me i #doubt# if he would have recognized me i must be somewhat altered since he last saw me
indeed but said $andrea_rondolo$ oh the #voice# of #nature# said $m_de_monte_cristo$
true interrupted the young #man# i had not looked upon it in that #light# now replied $m_de_monte_cristo$
there is only #one# source of uneasiness left in your #father# #mind# which is this he is anxious to know how you have been employed during your long absence from him
how you have been treated by your persecutors and if they have conducted themselves towards you with all the deference due to your rank
finally he is anxious to see if you have been fortunate enough to escape the bad moral influence to which you have been exposed and which is infinitely more to be dreaded than any physical suffering he #wish# to discover if the fine abilities with which #nature# had endowed you have been weakened by want of culture and in short whether you consider yourself capable of resuming and retaining in the #world# the high #position# to which your rank entitles you
#sir# exclaimed the young #man# quite astounded i #hope# no false report as for myself i first heard you spoken of by my #friend# $lord_wilmore$ the philanthropist
i believe he found you in some unpleasant #position# but do not know of what #nature# for i did not ask not being inquisitive
he told me that he was anxious to restore you to the #position# which you had lost and that he would seek your #father# until he found him
he did seek and has found him apparently since he is here now and finally my #friend# apprised me of your coming and gave me a few #other# instructions relative to your future #fortune#
i am quite aware that my #friend# $lord_wilmore$ is peculiar but he is sincere and as rich as a #gold# mine consequently he may indulge his eccentricities without any #fear# of their ruining him and i have promised to adhere to his instructions
now #sir# pray do not be offended at the #question# i am about to put to you as it comes in the #way# of my #duty# as your patron
i would #wish# to know if the #misfortune# which have happened to you #misfortune# entirely beyond your control and which in no degree diminish my regard for you
i would #wish# to know if they have not in some measure contributed to render you a #stranger# to the #world# in which your #fortune# and your #name# entitle you to make a conspicuous figure
your #misfortune# engaged his sympathies so you see you must have been interesting #sir# returned the young #man# with a reassurance of #manner# make your #mind# easy on this score
those who took me from my #father# and who always intended sooner or later to sell me again to my original proprietor as they have now done calculated that in #order# to make the most of their bargain it would be politic to leave me in #possession# of all my personal and hereditary worth and even to increase the value if possible
i have therefore received a very good education and have been treated by these kidnappers very much as the slaves were treated in asia minor whose #master# made them grammarians #doctor# and philosophers in #order# that they might fetch a higher price in the roman market
$m_de_monte_cristo$ smiled with satisfaction it appeared as if he had not expected so much from $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$
besides continued the young #man# if there did appear some defect in education or offence against the established forms of etiquette i suppose it would be excused in consideration of the #misfortune# which accompanied my birth and followed me through my youth
well said $m_de_monte_cristo$ in an indifferent #tone# you #will# do as you please #count# for you are the #master# of your own actions and are the #person# most concerned in the #matter# but if i were you i would not divulge a #word# of these adventures
your history is quite a romance and the #world# which delights in romances in yellow covers strangely mistrusts those which are bound in living parchment even though they be gilded like yourself
you would hardly have recited your touching history before it would go forth to the #world# and be deemed unlikely and unnatural
you would be no longer a lost #child# found but you would be looked upon as an upstart who had sprung up like a mushroom in the #night#
you might excite a little curiosity but it is not #everyone# who likes to be made the centre of observation and the #subject# of unpleasant remark
i agree with you $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said the young #man# turning pale and in #spite# of himself trembling beneath the scrutinizing #look# of his #companion# such consequences would be extremely unpleasant
this is the kind of difficulty which i wished to represent to you my dear #count#
nevertheless you must not exaggerate the evil said $m_de_monte_cristo$ for by endeavoring to avoid #one# fault you #will# fall into another
you must resolve upon #one# simple and single #line# of conduct and for a #man# of your intelligence this #plan# is as easy as it is necessary you must form honorable friendships and by that #mean# counteract the prejudice which may attach to the obscurity of your former #life#
did i not possess a moral distrust of my best #friend# and a #sort# of inclination to lead #other# to #doubt# them too therefore in departing from this rule i should as the actors say be playing a #part# quite out of my #line# and should therefore run the risk of being hissed which would be an act of folly
$andrea_rondolo$ visibly changed #countenance# i would offer myself as your surety and friendly adviser said $m_de_monte_cristo$
however your #excellency# said $andrea_rondolo$ in consideration of $lord_wilmore$ by whom i was recommended to you yes certainly interrupted $m_de_monte_cristo$
but $lord_wilmore$ did not omit to inform me my dear $andrea_rondolo$ that the season of your youth was rather a stormy #one#
i do not demand any confession from you it is precisely to avoid that necessity that your #father# was sent for from lucca
he is a little stiff and pompous in his #manner# and he is disfigured by his uniform but when it becomes known that he has been for eighteen #year# in the austrian #service# all that #will# be pardoned
ah said the #count# watching $andrea_rondolo$ #countenance# you shall soon see him we are not generally very severe with the austrians
ah #sir# you have given me confidence it is so long since we were separated that i have not the least remembrance of him and besides you know that in the #eye# of the #world# a large #fortune# covers all defects
in short you #will# find your #father# a very presentable #person# i assure you he is a millionaire
his income is #franc# then said the young #man# with anxiety i shall be sure to be placed in an agreeable #position#
he #will# allow you an income of livres per annum during the whole #time# of your stay in paris
#one# of the most agreeable possible my dear #sir# then in that #case# i shall always choose to remain there
but said he so long as i do remain in paris and #nothing# forces me to quit it do you #mean# to tell me that i may rely on receiving the #sum# you just now mentioned to me
you cannot control #circumstance# my dear #sir# #man# proposes and god disposes $andrea_rondolo$ sighed
you may shall i receive it from my #father# asked $andrea_rondolo$ with some uneasiness yes you #will# receive it from your #father# personally but $lord_wilmore$ #will# be the security for the #money#
he has at the request of your #father# opened an #account# of #franc# a #month# at $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ which is #one# of the safest banks in paris
and does my #father# #mean# to remain long in paris asked $andrea_rondolo$ only a few #day# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$
his #service# does not allow him to absent himself more than two or three weeks together ah my dear #father#
exclaimed $andrea_rondolo$ evidently charmed with the #idea# of his speedy departure therefore said $m_de_monte_cristo$ feigning to mistake his meaning therefore
i #will# not for another #instant# retard the #pleasure# of your meeting are you prepared to embrace your worthy #father#
i #hope# you do not #doubt# it go then into the #drawing# #room# my young #friend# where you #will# find your #father# awaiting you
$m_de_monte_cristo$ watched him till he disappeared and then touched a spring in a panel made to #look# like a picture which in sliding partly from the frame discovered to view a small #opening# so cleverly contrived that it revealed all that was passing in the #drawing# #room# now occupied by $monsieur_cavalcanti$ and $andrea_rondolo$
the young #man# closed the #door# behind him and advanced towards the major who had risen when he heard #step# approaching him
ah my dear #father# said $andrea_rondolo$ in a loud #voice# in #order# that the #count# might hear him in the next #room# is it really you
$andrea_rondolo$ made a low bow to the #count# and entered the adjoining #room# how do you do my dear #son# said the major gravely
after so many #year# of painful separation said $andrea_rondolo$ in the same #tone# of #voice# and glancing towards the #door# what a #happiness# it is to meet again
indeed it is after so long a separation #will# you not embrace me #sir# said $andrea_rondolo$
if you #wish# it my #son# said the major and the two #man# embraced each #other# after the fashion of actors on the stage that is to say each rested his #head# on the #other# #shoulder#
then we are once more reunited said $andrea_rondolo$ once more replied the major never more to be separated
i think my dear #son# you must be by this #time# so accustomed to france as to #look# upon it almost as a second #country#
why as to that the #fact# is said the young #man# that i should be exceedingly grieved to leave it
as for me you must know i cannot possibly live out of lucca therefore i shall #return# to italy as soon as i can
but before you leave france my dear #father# i #hope# you #will# put me in #possession# of the documents which #will# be necessary to prove my descent
certainly i am come expressly on that #account# it has cost me much trouble to find you but i had resolved on giving them into your #hand# and if i had to recommence my search it would occupy all the few remaining #year# of my #life#
$andrea_rondolo$ seized the certificate of his #father# #marriage# and his own baptismal register and after having opened them with all the eagerness which might be expected under the #circumstance# he read them with a facility which proved that he was accustomed to similar documents and with an #expression# which plainly denoted an unusual #interest# in the contents
when he had perused the documents an indefinable #expression# of #pleasure# lighted up his #countenance# and looking at the major with a most peculiar #smile# he said in very excellent tuscan
where are these #paper# then here they are then there is no longer any such #thing# in italy as being condemned to the galleys
the major drew himself up to his full height why what do you #mean# by that #question# i #mean# that if there were it would be impossible to draw up with impunity two such deeds as these
in france my dear #sir# #half# such a #piece# of effrontery as that would cause you to be quickly despatched to toulon for five #year# for change of #air#
#will# you be good enough to explain your meaning said the major endeavoring as much as possible to assume an #air# of the greatest majesty
my dear $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said $andrea_rondolo$ taking the major by the #arm# in a confidential #manner# how much are you paid for being my #father#
nonsense i am going to set you an example of confidence they give me #franc# a #year# to be your #son# consequently you can understand that it is not at all likely
the major was about to speak when $andrea_rondolo$ continued in a low #voice# i shall ever deny my parent
the major looked anxiously around him make yourself easy we are quite alone said $andrea_rondolo$ besides we are conversing in italian
well then replied the major they paid me #franc# down $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said $andrea_rondolo$ do you believe in fairy tales
i used not to do so but i really feel now almost obliged to have faith in them
you have then been induced to alter your #opinion# you have had some #proof# of their #truth# the major drew from his #pocket# a handful of #gold#
most palpable #proof# said he as you may perceive you think then that i may rely on the #count# #promise#
certainly i do you are sure he #will# keep his #word# with me to the #letter# but at the same #time# remember we must continue to play our respective #part#
i as a tender #father# and i as a dutiful #son# as they choose that i shall be descended from you
foi i can hardly tell but i was alluding to those who wrote the #letter# you received #one# did you not
whom do you #mean# by they ma yes from whom from a certain $abbé_busoni$
have you any knowledge of him no i have never seen him what did he say in the #letter#
you #will# #promise# not to betray me #rest# assured of that you well know that our #interest# are the same
then read for yourself and the major gave a #letter# into the young #man# #hand# $andrea_rondolo$ read in a low #voice#
you are poor a miserable old #age# awaits you would you like to become rich or at least independent
set out immediately for paris and demand of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ avenue des champs élysées no the #son# whom you had by the marchesa corsinari and who was taken from you at five #year# of #age#
in #order# that you may not #doubt# the kind intention of the writer of this #letter# you #will# find enclosed an #order# for #franc# payable in florence at signor gozzi also a #letter# of introduction to the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ on whom i give you a draft of #franc#
this #son# is named $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ remember to go to the #count# on the th may at seven clock in the #evening#
signed $abbé_busoni$ it is the same what do you #mean# said the major
i was going to say that i received a #letter# almost to the same #effect# you yes
from the $abbé_busoni$ no from whom then from an englishman called $lord_wilmore$ who takes the #name# of sinbad the #sailor#
and of whom you have no more knowledge than i of the $abbé_busoni$ you are mistaken there i am ahead of you
ah that is just what i cannot tell you if i did i should make you as wise as myself which it is not my intention to do
you have seen him then yes once where and what did the #letter# contain
read it you are poor and your future prospects are dark and gloomy do you #wish# for a #name#
should you like to be rich and your own #master# parbleu said the young #man# was it possible there could be two #answer# to such a #question#
take the post chaise which you #will# find waiting at the porte de gênes as you enter nice pass through turin chambéry and pont de beauvoisin
go to the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ avenue des champs élysées on the th of may at seven clock in the #evening# and demand of him your #father#
the marquis #will# give you some #paper# which #will# certify this #fact# and authorize you to appear under that #name# in the parisian #world#
you are the #son# of the marchese $monsieur_cavalcanti$ and the marchesa oliva corsinari as to your rank an annual income of livres #will# enable you to support it admirably
i enclose a draft for livres payable on ferrea #banker# at nice and also a #letter# of introduction to the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ whom i have directed to supply all your wants
sinbad the #sailor# humph said the major very good you have seen the #count# you say i have only just left him
and has he conformed to all that the #letter# specified he has do you understand it
not in the least there is a dupe somewhere at all #event# it is neither you nor i
certainly not well then why it does not much concern us do you think it does
no i agree with you there we must play the game to the #end# and consent to be blindfolded
ah you shall see i #promise# you i #will# sustain my #part# to admiration i never once doubted your doing so
on hearing the #sound# of his footsteps the two #man# threw themselves in each #other# #arm# and while they were in the midst of this embrace the #count# entered
$m_de_monte_cristo$ chose this #moment# for re entering the #drawing# #room# well marquis said $m_de_monte_cristo$ you appear to be in no #way# disappointed in the #son# whom your good #fortune# has restored to you
ah your #excellency# i am overwhelmed with delight and what are your #feeling# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ turning to the young #man#
there is only #one# #thing# which grieves me observed the major and that is the necessity for my leaving paris so soon
as for me my #heart# is overflowing with #happiness# happy #father# happy #son# said the #count#
ah my dear $monsieur_cavalcanti$ i trust you #will# not leave before i have had the #honor# of presenting you to some of my #friend#
i am at your #service# #sir# replied the major now #sir# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ addressing $andrea_rondolo$ make your confession
to whom tell $monsieur_cavalcanti$ #something# of the state of your finances ma foi $monsieur_cavalcanti$ you have touched upon a tender chord
do you hear what he says major certainly i do but do you understand
i do your #son# says he requires #money# well what would you have me do said the major
yes you said the #count# at the same #time# advancing towards $andrea_rondolo$ and slipping a packet of bank #note# into the young #man# #hand#
you should furnish him with some of #course# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ i what is this it is from your #father#
from my #father# yes did you not tell him just now that you wanted #money# well then he deputes me to give you this
am i to consider this as #part# of my income on #account# no it is for the first expenses of your settling in paris
ah how good my dear #father# is #silence# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ he does not #wish# you to know that it comes from him
i fully appreciate his delicacy said $andrea_rondolo$ cramming the #note# hastily into his #pocket# and now #gentleman# i #wish# you good #morning# said $m_de_monte_cristo$
and when shall we have the #honor# of seeing you again your #excellency# asked $monsieur_cavalcanti$ ah said $andrea_rondolo$ when may we #hope# for that #pleasure#
on saturday if you #will# yes let me see saturday i am to dine at my #country# $house_of_peers$ at $auteuil$ on that #day#
i #will# introduce you to him for it #will# be necessary he should know you as he is to pay your #money#
rue de la fontaine no several #person# are invited and among #other# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ your #banker# full dress
said the major #half# aloud oh yes certainly said the #count# uniform cross knee breeches and how shall i be dressed
demanded $andrea_rondolo$ oh very simply black trousers patent leather boots white waistcoat either a black or blue coat and a long cravat
go to blin or véronique for your clothes $monsieur_baptistin$ #will# tell you where if you do not know their address the less pretension there is in your attire the better #will# be the #effect# as you are a rich #man#
if you #mean# to buy any #horse# get them of devedeux and if you purchase a phaeton go to baptiste for it
at what #hour# shall we come asked the young #man# about #half# past six we #will# be with you at that #time# said the major
the two $monsieur_cavalcanti$ bowed to the #count# and left the $house_of_peers$ $m_de_monte_cristo$ went to the #window# and saw them crossing the #street# #arm# in #arm#
there go two miscreants said he it is a #pity# they are not really related then after an #instant# of gloomy reflection come i #will# go to see the morrels said he
in the lucern patch our readers must now allow us to transport them again to the enclosure surrounding $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ $house_of_peers$ and behind the #gate# #half# screened from view by the large chestnut #tree# which on all #side# spread their luxuriant branches we shall find some #people# of our acquaintance
i think that disgust is even more sickening than hatred #chapter# this #time# $m_maximilian_morrel$ was the first to arrive
he was intently watching for a #shadow# to appear among the #tree# and awaiting with anxiety the #sound# of a #light# #step# on the gravel walk
at #length# the long desired #sound# was heard and instead of #one# figure as he had expected he perceived that two were approaching him
the delay had been occasioned by a #visit# from #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ which had been prolonged beyond the #time# at which $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was expected
that she might not appear to fail in her #promise# to $m_maximilian_morrel$ she proposed to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ that they should take a walk in the #garden# being anxious to show that the delay which was doubtless a cause of vexation to him was not occasioned by any neglect on her #part#
the young #man# with the intuitive perception of a lover quickly understood the #circumstance# in which she was involuntarily placed and he was comforted
besides although she avoided coming within speaking #distance# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ arranged so that $m_maximilian_morrel$ could see her pass and repass and each #time# she went by she managed unperceived by her #companion# to cast an expressive #look# at the young #man# which seemed to say have patience
and $m_maximilian_morrel$ was patient and employed himself in mentally contrasting the two #girl# #one# fair with soft languishing #eye# a figure gracefully bending like a weeping willow the #other# a brunette with a fierce and haughty #expression# and as straight as a poplar
you see it is not my fault it is unnecessary to state that in the #eye# of the young #man# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ did not suffer by the contrast
in about #half# an #hour# the #girl# went away and $m_maximilian_morrel$ understood that $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #visit# had at last come to an #end#
for #fear# that #anyone# should be observing her #return# she walked slowly and instead of immediately directing her #step# towards the #gate# she seated herself on a bench and carefully casting her #eye# around to convince herself that she was not watched she presently arose and proceeded quickly to join $m_maximilian_morrel$
in a few #minute# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ re entered the #garden# alone good #evening# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said a well known #voice# good #evening# $m_maximilian_morrel$ i know i have kept you waiting but you saw the cause of my delay
yes i recognized $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i was not aware that you were so intimate with her who told you we were intimate $m_maximilian_morrel$
from the #manner# in which you walked and talked together #one# would have #thought# you were two school #girl# telling your #secret# to each #other#
she was owning to me her repugnance to the #marriage# with de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and i on the #other# #hand# was confessing to her
no #one# but you appeared to be so we were having a confidential #conversation# returned $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ how wretched it made me to think of marrying $m_franz_d_épinay$
that #will# #account# to you for the unreserved #manner# which you observed between me and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ as in speaking of the #man# whom i could not #love# my #thought# involuntarily reverted to him on whom my affections were fixed
dear $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ ah how good you are to say so $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ you possess a quality which can never belong to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
it is that indefinable charm which is to a #woman# what perfume is to the flower and flavor to the fruit for the beauty of either is not the only quality we seek
it is your #love# which makes you #look# upon #everything# in that #light# no $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ i assure you such is not the #case#
i was observing you both when you were walking in the #garden# and on my #honor# without at all wishing to depreciate the beauty of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i cannot understand how any #man# can really #love# her
the #fact# is $m_maximilian_morrel$ that i was there and my #presence# had the #effect# of rendering you unjust in your comparison
but tell me it is a #question# of simple curiosity and which was suggested by certain #idea# passing in my #mind# relative to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
no i dare say it is #something# disparaging which you are going to say it only proves how little indulgence we may expect from your sex interrupted $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
you cannot at least deny that you are very harsh judges of each #other# if we are so it is because we generally judge under the influence of excitement
but #return# to your #question# does $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ object to this #marriage# with de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ on #account# of loving another
yes but #girl# tell each #other# #secret# without being particularly intimate own now that you did #question# her on the #subject#
i told you i was not on terms of strict intimacy with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ ah i see you are smiling
if you are already aware of the #conversation# that passed the wooden partition which interposed between us and you has proved but a slight security
she told me that she loved no #one# said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ that she disliked the #idea# of being married that she would infinitely prefer leading an independent and unfettered #life# and that she almost wished her #father# might lose his #fortune# that she might become an artist like her #friend# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ armilly
come what did she say ah you see well what does that prove asked $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
#nothing# replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ then why did you #smile# why you know very well that you are reflecting on yourself $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
do you want me to go away ah no no but do not let us lose #time# you are the #subject# on which i #wish# to speak
true we must be quick for we have scarcely ten #minute# more to pass together ma foi
said $m_maximilian_morrel$ in consternation yes you are #right# i am but a poor #friend# to you what a #life#
i cause you to lead poor $m_maximilian_morrel$ you who are formed for #happiness# i bitterly reproach myself i assure you
well what does it signify $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ so long as i am satisfied and feel that even this long and painful suspense is amply repaid by five #minute# of your society or two #word# from your #lip#
and i have also a deep conviction that heaven would not have created two #heart# harmonizing as ours do and almost miraculously brought us together to separate us at last
those are kind and cheering #word# you must #hope# for us both $m_maximilian_morrel$ that #will# make me at least partly happy
i can only tell you that #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ sent to request my #presence# as she had a communication to make on which a #part# of my #fortune# depended
let them take my #fortune# i am already too rich and perhaps when they have taken it they #will# leave me in peace and quietness
but why must you leave me so soon i do not know particulars you would #love# me as much if i were poor would you not $m_maximilian_morrel$
what should i #care# for either riches or poverty if my $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was near me and i felt certain that no #one# could deprive me of her
oh i shall always #love# you but do you not #fear# that this communication may relate to your #marriage#
i do not think that is the #case# however it may be $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ you must not be alarmed
i assure you that as long as i live i shall never #love# #anyone# else do you think to reassure me when you say that
$m_maximilian_morrel$ pardon me you are #right# i am a brute but i was going to tell you that i met de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ the #other# #day#
well $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_franz_de_quesnel$ is his #friend# you know what then $monsieur_cavalcanti$ de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ has received a #letter# from $m_franz_de_quesnel$ announcing his immediate #return#
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ turned pale and leaned her #hand# against the #gate# ah heavens if it were that but no the communication would not come through #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
but it has appeared as if #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ secretly objected to the #marriage# although she did not choose openly to oppose it
why not because i scarcely know why is it so then i feel as if i could adore #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
if she objects to your marrying $m_franz_d_épinay$ she would be all the more likely to listen to any #other# proposition
do not be in such a hurry to do that said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ with a sad #smile# no $m_maximilian_morrel$ it is not suitors to which #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ objects it is #marriage# itself
#marriage# if she dislikes that so much why did she ever marry herself you do not understand me $m_maximilian_morrel$
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in #spite# of all the remarks which she considered it her #duty# to make secretly approved of the proposition my #father# consented to it at her instigation and it was only on #account# of my poor #grandfather# that i finally abandoned the project
you can form no #idea# of the #expression# of that old #man# #eye# when he #look# at me the only #person# in the #world# whom he loves and i had almost said by whom he is beloved in #return#
when he learned my resolution i shall never forget the reproachful #look# which he cast on me and the #tear# of utter #despair# which chased each #other# down his lifeless cheeks
ah $m_maximilian_morrel$ i experienced at that #moment# such remorse for my intention that throwing myself at his #foot# i exclaimed forgive me pray forgive me
about a #year# ago i talked of retiring to a convent my dear #grandfather# they may do what they #will# with me i #will# never leave you
ah $m_maximilian_morrel$ i may have much to suffer but i feel as if my #grandfather# #look# at that #moment# would more than compensate for all
dear $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ you are a perfect angel and i am sure i do not know what i sabring #right# and left among the bedouins can have done to merit your being revealed to me unless indeed heaven took into consideration the #fact# that the victims of my sword were infidels
when i had ceased speaking he thankfully raised his #eye# to heaven but without uttering a #word# but tell me what #interest# #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ can have in your remaining unmarried
i possess nearly livres in #right# of my #mother# my #grandfather# and my grandmother the marquis and marquise de $madame_de_saint_méran$ #will# leave me as much and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ evidently intends making me his heir
did i not tell you just now that i was rich $m_maximilian_morrel$ too rich my #brother# $edward$ who inherits #nothing# from his #mother# #will# therefore be poor in comparison with me
now if i had taken the veil all this #fortune# would have descended to my #father# and in reversion to his #son#
it is not for herself that she is so but for her #son# and what you regard as a vice becomes almost a virtue when looked at in the #light# of maternal #love#
ah how strange it seems that such a young and beautiful #woman# should be so avaricious
but could you not compromise #matter# and give up a portion of your #fortune# to her #son# how could i make such a proposition especially to a #woman# who always professes to be so entirely disinterested
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ i have always regarded our #love# in the #light# of #something# sacred consequently i have covered it with the veil of respect and hid it in the innermost recesses of my soul
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #will# you permit me to make a confidant of a #friend# and reveal to him the #love# i bear you $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ started
no human being not even my sister is aware of its existence a #friend# $m_maximilian_morrel$ and who is this #friend#
have you never experienced for #anyone# that sudden and irresistible sympathy which made you feel as if the object of it had been your old and familiar #friend# though in reality it was the first #time# you had ever met
nay further have you never endeavored to recall the #time# #place# and #circumstance# of your former intercourse and failing in this attempt have almost believed that your spirits must have held converse with each #other# in some state of being anterior to the present and that you are only now occupied in a reminiscence of the past
i tremble to give my permission listen $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ yes well that is precisely the #feeling# which i experienced when i first saw that extraordinary #man#
extraordinary did you say yes you have known him for some #time# then scarcely longer than eight or ten #day#
and do you call a #man# your #friend# whom you have only known for eight or ten #day# ah $m_maximilian_morrel$ i had hoped you set a higher value on the title of #friend#
your logic is most powerful $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ but say what you #will# i can never renounce the sentiment which has instinctively taken #possession# of my #mind#
i feel as if it were ordained that this #man# should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me and sometimes it really seems as if his #eye# was able to see what was to come and his #hand# endowed with the #power# of directing #event# according to his own #will#
indeed said $m_maximilian_morrel$ i have often been almost tempted to attribute to him the gift of prophecy at all #event# he has a wonderful #power# of foretelling any future good
ah said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ in a mournful #tone# do let me see this #man# $m_maximilian_morrel$ he may tell me whether i shall ever be loved sufficiently to make amends for all i have suffered
he must be a prophet then said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ smiling my poor #girl# you know him already
i know him yes it was he who saved the #life# of your #step# #mother# and her #son#
the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ the same ah cried $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ he is too much the #friend# of #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ ever to be mine
the #friend# of #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ it cannot be surely $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ you are mistaken no indeed i am not for i assure you his #power# over our household is almost unlimited
courted by my #step# #mother# who regards him as the epitome of human wisdom admired by my #father# who says he has never before heard such sublime #idea# so eloquently expressed idolized by $edward$ who notwithstanding his #fear# of the #count# large black #eye# runs to meet him the #moment# he arrives and opens his #hand# in which he is sure to find some delightful present de $m_de_monte_cristo$ appears to exert a mysterious and almost uncontrollable influence over all the members of our #family#
if such be the #case# my dear $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ you must yourself have felt or at all #event# #will# soon feel the #effect# of his #presence#
he meets $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in italy it is to rescue him from the #hand# of the banditti he introduces himself to #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
it is that he may give her a royal present your #step# #mother# and her #son# pass before his #door# it is that his nubian may save them from destruction
this #man# evidently possesses the #power# of influencing #event# both as regards #man# and #thing# i never saw more simple tastes united to greater magnificence
his #smile# is so sweet when he addresses me that i forget it ever can be bitter to #other# ah $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ tell me if he ever looked on you with #one# of those sweet #smile#
me said the young #girl# he never even #glance# at me on the #contrary# if i accidentally cross his path he appears rather to avoid me
ah he is not generous neither does he possess that supernatural penetration which you attribute to him for if he did he would have perceived that i was unhappy and if he had been generous seeing me sad and solitary he would have used his influence to my advantage and since as you say he resembles the sun he would have warmed my #heart# with #one# of his #life# giving rays
if so depend on it you #will# be happy you say he loves you $m_maximilian_morrel$ how do you know that he does
all would pay deference to an #officer# like you with a fierce moustache and a long sabre but they think they may crush a poor weeping #girl# with impunity
if it were otherwise if he treated me diplomatically that is to say like a #man# who #wish# by some #mean# or #other# to obtain a footing in the $house_of_peers$ so that he may ultimately gain the #power# of dictating to its occupants
he would if it had been but once have honored me with the #smile# which you extol so loudly but no he saw that i was unhappy he understood that i could be of no #use# to him and therefore paid no #attention# to me whatever
who knows but that in #order# to please #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and my #father# he may not persecute me by every #mean# in his #power#
ah $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ i assure you you are mistaken it is not just that he should despise me so without any #reason#
i have done wrong for i have given utterance to #thought# concerning that #man# which i did not even know existed in my #heart#
i do not deny the influence of which you speak or that i have not myself experienced it but with me it has been productive of evil rather than good
ah forgive me said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ perceiving the #effect# which her #word# were producing on $m_maximilian_morrel$ well $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said $m_maximilian_morrel$ with a sigh we #will# not discuss the #matter# further
i #will# not make a confidant of him alas said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ i see that i have given you pain
i can only say how sincerely i ask pardon for having grieved you but indeed i am not prejudiced beyond the #power# of conviction
i own that your #question# embarrasses me $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ for i cannot say that the #count# has rendered me any ostensible #service#
still as i have already told you i have an instinctive affection for him the source of which i cannot explain to you
tell me what this #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ has done for you has the sun done #anything# for me
no he warms me with his rays and it is by his #light# that i see you #nothing# more has such and such a perfume done #anything# for me
its odor charms #one# of my senses that is all i can say when i am asked why i praise it
a #secret# #voice# seems to whisper to me that there must be #something# more than #chance# in this unexpected reciprocity of friendship
no my friendship for him is as strange and unaccountable as his for me in his most simple actions as well as in his most #secret# #thought# i find a relation to my own
you #will# perhaps #smile# at me when i tell you that ever since i have known this #man# i have involuntarily entertained the #idea# that all the good #fortune# which has befallen me originated from him
however i have managed to live thirty #year# without this protection you #will# say but i #will# endeavor a little to illustrate my meaning
he invited me to dine with him on saturday which was a very natural #thing# for him to do well what have i learned since
that your #mother# and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ are both coming to this #dinner# i shall meet them there and who knows what future advantages may result from the interview
this may appear to you to be no unusual combination of #circumstance# nevertheless i perceive some hidden plot in the arrangement #something# in #fact# more than is apparent on a casual view of the #subject#
i believe that this singular #man# who appears to fathom the motives of #everyone# has purposely arranged for me to meet and #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and sometimes i confess i have gone so far as to try to read in his #eye# whether he was in #possession# of the #secret# of our #love#
i should take you for a visionary and should tremble for your #reason# if i were always to hear you talk in a strain similar to this
my good #friend# said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ is it possible that you can see #anything# more than the merest #chance# in this meeting
my #father# who never goes out has several #time# been on the #point# of refusing this invitation #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ on the #contrary# is burning with the #desire# of seeing this extraordinary nabob in his own $house_of_peers$ therefore she has with great difficulty prevailed on my #father# to accompany her
$m_maximilian_morrel$ there is no #one# in the #world# of whom i can ask help but yourself and my #grandfather# who is little better than a corpse
pray reflect a little no no it is as i have said no support to cling to but my #mother# in heaven
i see that you are #right# logically speaking said $m_maximilian_morrel$ but the gentle #voice# which usually has such #power# over me fails to convince me #today#
i feel the same as regards yourself said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and i own that if you have no stronger #proof# to give me
i have another replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ but i #fear# you #will# deem it even more absurd than the first
my ten #year# of #service# have also confirmed my #idea# on the #subject# of sudden inspirations for i have several #time# owed my #life# to a mysterious impulse which directed me to move at once either to the #right# or to the left in #order# to escape the ball which killed the comrade fighting by my #side# while it left me unharmed
so much the worse said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ smiling it is nevertheless conclusive to my #mind# dear $m_maximilian_morrel$ why not attribute your escape to my constant prayers for your safety
when you are away i no longer pray for myself but for you yes since you have known me said $m_maximilian_morrel$ smiling
you are very provoking and #will# not give me credit for #anything# but let me hear this second #proof# which you yourself own to be absurd
but that cannot apply to the #time# previous to our acquaintance $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ well #look# through this #opening# and you #will# see the beautiful new #horse# which i rode here
ah what a beautiful creature cried $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ why did you not bring him close to the #gate# so that i could talk to him and pat him
he is as you see a very valuable animal said $m_maximilian_morrel$ you know that my #mean# are limited and that i am what would be designated a #man# of moderate pretensions
well i went to a #horse# dealer where i saw this magnificent #horse# which i have named médéah i asked the price they told me it was #franc#
i went away with rather a heavy #heart# for the #horse# had looked at me affectionately had rubbed his #head# against me and when i mounted him had pranced in the most delightful #way# imaginable so that i was altogether fascinated with him
the same #evening# some #friend# of mine visited me de $baron_de_château_renaud$ $m_lucien_debray$ and five or six #other# choice spirits whom you do not know even by #name#
i was therefore obliged to give it up as you may imagine but i own they proposed a game of bouillotte
but i was at my own $house_of_peers$ you understand so there was #nothing# to be done but to send for the cards which i did
i never play for i am not rich enough to afford to lose or sufficiently poor to #desire# to gain
just as they were sitting down to #table# de $m_de_monte_cristo$ arrived he took his #seat# amongst them they played and i won
i am almost ashamed to say that my gains amounted to #franc# we separated at midnight i could not defer my #pleasure# so i took a cabriolet and drove to the #horse# dealer
feverish and excited i rang at the #door# the #person# who opened it must have taken me for a madman for i rushed at once to the stable
i immediately put on the saddle and bridle to which operation he lent himself with the best grace possible then putting the #franc# into the #hand# of the astonished dealer i proceeded to fulfil my intention of passing the #night# in riding in the champs élysées
as i rode by the #count# $house_of_peers$ i perceived a #light# in #one# of the #window# and fancied i saw the #shadow# of his figure moving behind the curtain
now $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ i firmly believe that he knew of my #wish# to possess this #horse# and that he lost expressly to give me the #mean# of procuring him
médéah was standing at the rack eating his hay my dear $m_maximilian_morrel$ you are really too fanciful you #will# not #love# even me long
a #man# who accustoms himself to live in such a #world# of poetry and imagination must find far too little excitement in a common every #day# #sort# of attachment such as ours
ah $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said $m_maximilian_morrel$ give me but #one# #finger# through this #opening# in the grating #one# #finger# the littlest #finger# of all that i may have the #happiness# of kissing it
but they are calling me do you hear $m_maximilian_morrel$ we said we would be to each #other# as two #voice# two #shadow#
as you #will# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ shall you be happy if i do what you #wish# oh yes
$m_maximilian_morrel$ uttered a #cry# of delight and springing forwards seized the #hand# extended towards him and imprinted on it a fervent and impassioned kiss
the little #hand# was then immediately withdrawn and the young #man# saw $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ hurrying towards the $house_of_peers$ as though she were almost terrified at her own sensations
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ mounted on a bench and passed not only her #finger# but her whole #hand# through the #opening# #chapter# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
we #will# now relate what was passing in the $house_of_peers$ of the #king# attorney after the departure of #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and her #daughter# and during the #time# of the #conversation# between $m_maximilian_morrel$ and $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ which we have just detailed
both of the visitors after saluting the old #man# and speaking to $barrois$ a faithful #servant# who had been twenty five #year# in his #service# took their #place# on either #side# of the paralytic
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was sitting in an armchair which moved upon casters in which he was wheeled into the #room# in the #morning# and in the same #way# drawn out again at #night#
he was placed before a large #glass# which reflected the whole #apartment# and so without any attempt to move which would have been impossible he could see all who entered the #room# and #everything# which was going on around him
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ although almost as immovable as a corpse looked at the new comers with a quick and intelligent #expression# perceiving at once by their ceremonious courtesy that they were come on #business# of an unexpected and official character
#sight# and hearing were the only senses remaining and they like two solitary sparks remained to animate the miserable #body# which seemed fit for #nothing# but the grave
it was only however by #mean# of #one# of these senses that he could reveal the #thought# and #feeling# that still occupied his #mind# and the #look# by which he gave #expression# to his inner #life# was like the distant gleam of a candle which a #traveller# sees by #night# across some desert #place# and knows that a living being dwells beyond the #silence# and obscurity
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #hair# was long and white and flowed over his #shoulder# while in his #eye# shaded by thick black lashes was concentrated as it often happens with an organ which is used to the exclusion of the #other# all the activity address force and intelligence which were formerly diffused over his whole #body# and so although the movement of the #arm# the #sound# of the #voice# and the agility of the #body# were wanting the speaking #eye# sufficed for all
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ entered his #father# #room# followed by #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ he commanded with it it was the medium through which his #thank# were conveyed
in short his whole #appearance# produced on the #mind# the impression of a corpse with living #eye# and #nothing# could be more startling than to observe the #expression# of anger or #joy# suddenly lighting up these organs while the #rest# of the rigid and marble like #feature# were utterly deprived of the #power# of participation
three #person# only could understand this language of the poor paralytic these were $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and the old #servant# of whom we have already spoken
but as $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ saw his #father# but seldom and then only when absolutely obliged and as he never took any pains to please or gratify him when he was there all the old #man# #happiness# was centred in his granddaughter
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ by #mean# of her #love# her patience and her devotion had learned to read in $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #look# all the varied #feeling# which were passing in his #mind#
to this dumb language which was so unintelligible to #other# she answered by throwing her whole soul into the #expression# of her #countenance# and in this #manner# were the #conversation# sustained between the blooming #girl# and the helpless invalid whose #body# could scarcely be called a living #one# but who nevertheless possessed a fund of knowledge and penetration united with a #will# as powerful as ever although clogged by a #body# rendered utterly incapable of obeying its impulses
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had solved the problem and was able easily to understand his #thought# and to convey her own in #return# and through her untiring and devoted assiduity it was seldom that in the ordinary transactions of every #day# #life# she failed to anticipate the #wish# of the living thinking #mind# or the wants of the almost inanimate #body#
as to the #servant# he had as we have said been with his #master# for five and twenty #year# therefore he knew all his habits and it was seldom that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ found it necessary to ask for #anything# so prompt was he in administering to all the necessities of the invalid
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ did not need the help of either $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ or the domestic in #order# to carry on with his #father# the strange #conversation# which he was about to begin
as we have said he perfectly understood the old #man# vocabulary and if he did not #use# it more often it was only indifference and ennui which prevented him from so doing
he therefore allowed $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ to go into the #garden# sent away $barrois$ and after having seated himself at his #father# #right# #hand# while #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ placed herself on the left he addressed him thus
i trust you #will# not be displeased #sir# that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ has not come with us or that i dismissed $barrois$ for our conference #will# be #one# which could not with propriety be carried on in the #presence# of either
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #face# remained perfectly passive during this long preamble while on the #contrary# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #eye# was endeavoring to penetrate into the inmost recesses of the old #man# #heart#
this communication continued the #procureur# in that cold and decisive #tone# which seemed at once to preclude all discussion #will# we are sure meet with your approbation
the #eye# of the invalid still retained that vacancy of #expression# which prevented his #son# from obtaining any knowledge of the #feeling# which were passing in his #mind# he listened #nothing# more
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and i have a communication to make to you #sir# resumed $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
had the old #man# #face# been moulded in wax it could not have shown less #emotion# at this news than was now to be traced there
we are thinking of marrying $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ the #marriage# #will# take #place# in less than three #month# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #eye# still retained its inanimate #expression#
we #thought# this news would possess an #interest# for you #sir# who have always entertained a great affection for $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ it therefore only now remains for us to tell you the #name# of the young #man# for whom she is destined
it is #one# of the most desirable connections which could possibly be formed he possesses #fortune# a high rank in society and every personal qualification likely to render $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ supremely happy his #name# moreover cannot be wholly unknown to you
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ now took her #part# in the #conversation# and added it is $m_franz_de_quesnel$ $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #baron# épinay
when #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ pronounced the #name# of $m_franz_de_quesnel$ the pupil of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #eye# began to dilate and his eyelids trembled with the same movement that may be perceived on the #lip# of an individual about to speak and he darted a lightning #glance# at #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and his #son#
the #procureur# who knew the political hatred which had formerly existed between $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and the elder épinay well understood the agitation and anger which the announcement had produced but feigning not to perceive either he immediately resumed the narrative begun by his #wife#
you are aware that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ is about to enter her nineteenth #year# which renders it important that she should lose no #time# in forming a suitable alliance
nevertheless you have not been forgotten in our #plan# and we have fully ascertained beforehand that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ future #husband# #will# consent not to live in this $house_of_peers$ for that might not be pleasant for the young #people# but that you should live with them so that you and $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ who are so attached to each #other# would not be separated and you would be able to pursue exactly the same #course# of #life# which you have hitherto done and thus instead of losing you #will# be a gainer by the change as it #will# secure to you two #child# instead of #one# to watch over and comfort you
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #look# was furious it was very evident that #something# desperate was passing in the old #man# #mind# for a #cry# of anger and #grief# rose in his throat and not being able to find vent in utterance appeared almost to choke him for his #face# and #lip# turned quite purple with the struggle
while his #wife# was speaking $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had narrowly watched the old #man# #countenance# #sir# said he $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ quietly opened a #window# saying it is very warm and the heat affects $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
this #marriage# added #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ is quite agreeable to the #wish# of $m_franz_d_épinay$ and his #family# besides he had no relations nearer than an uncle and aunt his #mother# having died at his birth and his #father# having been assassinated in that is to say when he was but two #year# old it naturally followed that the #child# was permitted to choose his own pursuits and he has therefore seldom acknowledged any #other# authority but that of his own #will#
that assassination was a mysterious #affair# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and the perpetrators have hitherto escaped detection although suspicion has fallen on the #head# of more than #one# #person#
he then returned to his #place# but did not sit down $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ made such an #effort# that his #lip# expanded into a #smile#
now continued $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ those to whom the guilt really belongs by whom the #crime# was committed on whose #head# the #justice# of #man# may probably descend here and the certain judgment of god hereafter would rejoice in the opportunity thus afforded of bestowing such a peace offering as $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ on the #son# of him whose #life# they so ruthlessly destroyed
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had succeeded in mastering his #emotion# more than could have been deemed possible with such an enfeebled and shattered frame
yes i understand was the reply contained in his #look# and this #look# expressed a #feeling# of strong indignation mixed with profound contempt
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ fully understood his #father# meaning and answered by a slight shrug of his #shoulder# he then motioned to his #wife# to take leave
now #sir# said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i must bid you farewell would you like me to send $edward$ to you for a short #time#
it had been agreed that the old #man# should express his approbation by closing his #eye# his refusal by winking them several #time# and if he had some #desire# or #feeling# to express he raised them to heaven
if he wanted $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ he closed his #right# #eye# only and if $barrois$ the left at #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ proposition he instantly winked his #eye#
provoked by a complete refusal she bit her #lip# and said then shall i send $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ to you the old #man# closed his #eye# eagerly thereby intimating that such was his #wish#
m and #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ bowed and left the #room# giving #order# that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ should be summoned to her #grandfather# #presence# and #feeling# sure that she would have much to do to restore calmness to the perturbed spirit of the invalid
#one# #look# was sufficient to tell her that her #grandfather# was suffering and that there was much on his #mind# which he was wishing to communicate to her
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ with a color still heightened by #emotion# entered the #room# just after her parents had quitted it dear grandpapa cried she what has happened
they have vexed you and you are angry the paralytic closed his #eye# in token of assent who has displeased you
is it my #father# no #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ no me the former #sign# was repeated are you displeased with me cried $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ in #astonishment#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ again closed his #eye# and what have i done dear grandpapa that you should be angry with me
cried $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ there was no #answer# and she continued i have not seen you all #day# has #anyone# been speaking to you against me
yes said the old #man# #look# with eagerness let me think a #moment# i do assure you grandpapa
ah and #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ have just left this #room# have they not yes and it was they who told you #something# which made you angry
what was it then may i go and ask them that i may have the opportunity of making my peace with you
no no said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #look# ah you frighten me what can they have said and she again tried to think what it could be
ah i know said she lowering her #voice# and going close to the old #man# they have been speaking of my #marriage# have
they not yes replied the angry #look# i understand you are displeased at the #silence# i have preserved on the #subject#
the #reason# of it was that they had insisted on my keeping the #matter# a #secret# and begged me not to tell you #anything# of it
they did not even acquaint me with their intentions and i only discovered them by #chance# that is why i have been so reserved with you dear grandpapa
pray forgive me but there was no #look# calculated to reassure her all it seemed to say was it is not only your reserve which afflicts me
what is it then asked the young #girl# perhaps you think i shall abandon you dear grandpapa and that i shall forget you when i am married
no they told you then that $m_franz_d_épinay$ consented to our all living together yes then why are you still vexed and grieved
the old #man# #eye# beamed with an #expression# of gentle affection yes i understand said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ it is because you #love# me
the old #man# assented and you are afraid i shall be unhappy yes you do not like $m_franz_de_quesnel$
the #eye# repeated several #time# no no no then you are vexed with the engagement yes
well listen said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ throwing herself on her knees and putting her #arm# round her #grandfather# neck i am vexed too for i do not #love# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay
an #expression# of intense #joy# illumined the old #man# #eye# when i wished to retire into a convent you remember how angry you were with me
well continued $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ the #reason# of my proposing it was that i might escape this hateful #marriage# which drives me to #despair#
a #tear# trembled in the #eye# of the invalid $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ breathing came thick and short then the #idea# of this #marriage# really grieves you too
but you are unable to oppose them you whose #mind# is so quick and whose #will# is so firm are nevertheless as weak and unequal to the contest as i am myself
alas you who would have been such a powerful protector to me in the #day# of your health and #strength# can now only sympathize in my #joy# and sorrows without being able to take any active #part# in them
however this is much and calls for gratitude and heaven has not taken away all my blessings when it leaves me your sympathy and kindness
at these #word# there appeared in $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #eye# an #expression# of such deep meaning that the young #girl# #thought# she could read these #word# there
ah if you could but help me if we could both together defeat their #plan# you are mistaken i can still do much for you
do you think you can help me dear grandpapa said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ yes $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ raised his #eye# it was the #sign# agreed on between him and $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ when he wanted #anything#
what is it you want dear grandpapa said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and she endeavored to recall to #mind# all the #thing# which he would be likely to need and as the #idea# presented themselves to her #mind# she repeated them aloud then finding that all her #effort# elicited #nothing# but a constant
no she said come since this #plan# does not #answer# i #will# have recourse to another she then recited all the #letter# of the alphabet from a down to
when she arrived at that #letter# the paralytic made her understand that she had spoken the initial #letter# of the #thing# he wanted
ah said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ the #thing# you #desire# begins with the #letter# it is with that we have to do then
well let me see what can you want that begins with na ne ni no yes yes yes said the old #man# #eye#
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ fetched a dictionary which she placed on a desk before $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ she opened it and seeing that the old #man# #eye# was thoroughly fixed on its pages she ran her #finger# quickly up and down the columns
during the six #year# which had passed since $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ first fell into this sad state $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #power# of invention had been too often put to the test not to render her expert in devising expedients for gaining a knowledge of his #wish# and the constant practice had so perfected her in the art that she guessed the old #man# meaning as quickly as if he himself had been able to seek for what he wanted
ah it is no then yes at the #word# #notary# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ made a #sign# to her to stop
#notary# said she do you want a #notary# dear grandpapa the old #man# again signified that it was a #notary# he desired
you would #wish# a #notary# to be sent for then said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ yes shall my #father# be informed of your #wish#
yes do you #wish# the #notary# to be sent for immediately yes then they shall go for him directly dear grandpapa
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ rang the bell and ordered the #servant# to tell $monsieur_cavalcanti$ or #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ that they were requested to come to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #room#
is that all you want yes are you satisfied now inquired $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ yes i am sure you are it is not very difficult to discover that
and the young #girl# smiled on her #grandfather# as if he had been a #child# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ entered followed by $barrois$
what do you want me for #sir# demanded he of the paralytic #sir# said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ my #grandfather# #wish# for a #notary#
yes motioned the latter with a firmness which seemed to declare that with the help of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and his old #servant# who both knew what his #wish# were he was quite prepared to maintain the contest
at this strange and unexpected demand $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and his #father# exchanged #look# do you #wish# for a #notary#
asked $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ yes what to do $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ made no #answer# what do you want with a #notary#
again repeated $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the invalid #eye# remained fixed by which #expression# he intended to intimate that his resolution was unalterable
still said $barrois$ with the freedom and fidelity of an old #servant# if $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ asks for a #notary# i suppose he really #wish# for a #notary#
is it to do us some ill #turn# do you think it is worth while said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ therefore i shall go at once and fetch #one#
yes i do want a #notary# motioned the old #man# shutting his #eye# with a #look# of defiance which seemed to say
$barrois$ acknowledged no #master# but $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and never allowed his #desire# in any #way# to be contradicted and i should like to see the #person# who dares to refuse my request
but i shall explain to him your state of health and make excuses for you for the #scene# cannot fail of being a most ridiculous #one#
you shall have a #notary# as you absolutely #wish# for #one# #sir# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ never #mind# that said $barrois$ i shall go and fetch a #notary# nevertheless
the #will# as soon as $barrois$ had left the #room# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looked at $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ with a malicious #expression# that said many #thing#
the young #girl# perfectly understood the #look# and so did $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ for his #countenance# became clouded and he knitted his eyebrows angrily
and the old #servant# departed triumphantly on his mission #chapter# he took a #seat# and quietly awaited the arrival of the #notary#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ saw him #seat# himself with an #appearance# of perfect indifference at the same #time# giving a #side# #look# at $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ which made her understand that she also was to remain in the #room#
three #quarter# of an #hour# after $barrois$ returned bringing the #notary# with him #sir# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ after the first salutations were over you were sent for by $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ whom you see here
all his limbs have become completely paralysed he has lost his #voice# also and we ourselves find much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his meaning
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ cast an appealing #look# on $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ which #look# was at once so earnest and imperative that she answered immediately
#sir# said she i perfectly understand my #grandfather# meaning at all #time# that is quite true said $barrois$
permit me said the #notary# turning first to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and then to $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ permit me to state that the #case# in #question# is just #one# of those in which a public #officer# like myself cannot proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility
the first #thing# necessary to render an act valid is that the #notary# should be thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the #will# and #wish# of the #person# dictating the act
now i cannot be sure of the approbation or disapprobation of a client who cannot speak and as the object of his #desire# or his repugnance cannot be clearly proved to me on #account# of his want of speech my #service# here would be quite useless and cannot be legally exercised
and that is what i told the #gentleman# as we walked along the #notary# then prepared to retire an imperceptible #smile# of triumph was expressed on the #lip# of the #procureur#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looked at $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ with an #expression# so full of #grief# that she arrested the departure of the #notary# #sir# said she
the language which i speak with my #grandfather# may be easily learnt and i can teach you in a few #minute# to understand it almost as well as i can myself
#will# you tell me what you require in #order# to set your conscience quite at ease on the #subject# in #order# to render an act valid i must be certain of the approbation or disapprobation of my client
well #sir# by the help of two #sign# with which i #will# acquaint you presently you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my #grandfather# is still in the full #possession# of all his mental faculties
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ being deprived of #voice# and motion is accustomed to convey his meaning by closing his #eye# when he #wish# to signify
illness of #body# would not affect the validity of the deed but sanity of #mind# is absolutely requisite
yes and to wink when he #mean# no you now know quite enough to enable you to converse with $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ try
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ gave $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ such a #look# of tenderness and gratitude that it was comprehended even by the #notary# himself
you have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying #sir# have you asked the #notary# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ closed his #eye#
and you approve of what she said that is to say you declare that the #sign# which she mentioned are really those by #mean# of which you are accustomed to convey your #thought#
yes it was you who sent for me yes to make your #will# yes
and you do not #wish# me to go away without fulfilling your original intentions the old #man# winked violently
well #sir# said the young #girl# do you understand now and is your conscience perfectly at #rest# on the #subject#
#sir# said he do you suppose for a #moment# that a #man# can sustain a physical shock such as $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ has received without any detriment to his mental faculties
it is not exactly that #sir# said the #notary# which makes me uneasy but the difficulty #will# be in wording his #thought# and intentions so as to be able to get his #answer#
but before the #notary# could #answer# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had drawn him aside you must see that to be an utter impossibility said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and the old #man# heard this #conversation# and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ fixed his #eye# so earnestly on $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ that she felt bound to #answer# to the #look#
#sir# said she that need not make you uneasy however difficult it may at first #sight# appear to be i can discover and explain to you
i have now been six #year# with $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and let him tell you if ever once during that #time# he has entertained a #thought# which he was unable to make me understand
my #grandfather# #thought# so as to put an #end# to all your #doubt# and #fear# on the #subject# no signed the old #man#
let us try what we can do then said the #notary# you accept this young #lady# as your interpreter $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
yes well #sir# what do you require of me and what document is it that you #wish# to be drawn up
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ named all the #letter# of the alphabet until she came to at this #letter# the eloquent #eye# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ gave her notice that she was to stop
it is very evident that it is the #letter# which $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ wants said the #notary# wait said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and turning to her #grandfather# she repeated
wa we wi the old #man# stopped her at the last syllable $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ then took the dictionary and the #notary# watched her while she turned over the pages
she passed her #finger# slowly down the columns and when she came to the #word# #will# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #eye# bade her stop
#will# said the #notary# it is very evident that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ is desirous of making his #will#
yes yes yes motioned the invalid really #sir# you must allow that this is most extraordinary said the astonished #notary# turning to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
and i think the #will# #promise# to be yet more extraordinary for i cannot see how it is to be drawn up without the intervention of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and she may perhaps be considered as too much interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of the obscure and ill defined #wish# of her #grandfather#
yes said the #procureur# no no no replied the #eye# of the paralytic what said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
#sir# said the #notary# whose #interest# had been greatly excited and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the #account# of this extraordinary and picturesque #scene# what appeared so impossible to me an #hour# ago has now become quite easy and practicable and this may be a perfectly valid #will# provided it be read in the #presence# of seven witnesses approved by the testator and sealed by the #notary# in the #presence# of the witnesses
do you #mean# to say that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ is not interested in your #will# no as to the #time# it #will# not require very much more than the generality of #will#
as to the details the greater #part# #will# be furnished afterwards by the state in which we find the #affair# of the testator and by yourself who having had the management of them can doubtless give full information on the #subject#
but besides all this in #order# that the instrument may not be contested i am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity therefore #one# of my colleagues #will# help me and #contrary# to custom #will# assist in the dictation of the testament
there are certain forms necessary to be gone through and which are always the same are you satisfied #sir# continued the #notary# addressing the old #man#
yes looked the invalid his #eye# beaming with delight at the ready interpretation of his meaning what is he going to do
he left the #room# to give #order# for another #notary# to be sent but $barrois$ who had heard all that passed had guessed his #master# #wish# and had already gone to fetch #one#
#thought# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ whose #position# demanded much reserve but who was longing to know what his #father# intentions were the #procureur# then told his #wife# to come up
in the #course# of a #quarter# of an #hour# #everyone# had assembled in the #chamber# of the paralytic the second #notary# had also arrived
they read to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the formal copy of a #will# in #order# to give him an #idea# of the terms in which such documents are generally couched then in #order# to test the capacity of the testator the first #notary# said turning towards him
a few #word# sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two #officer# of the #law# when an individual makes his #will# it is generally in favor or in prejudice of some #person#
i #will# #name# to you several #sum# which #will# increase by gradation you #will# stop me when i reach the #one# representing the amount of your own #possession#
yes have you an exact #idea# of the amount of your #fortune# yes yes
never had the struggle between #mind# and #matter# been more apparent than now and if it was not a sublime it was at least a curious spectacle
they had formed a circle round the invalid the second #notary# was sitting at a #table# prepared for writing and his colleague was standing before the testator in the act of interrogating him on the #subject# to which we have alluded
there was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation your #fortune# exceeds #franc# does it not asked he $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ made a #sign# that it did
do you possess #franc# inquired the #notary# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #eye# remained immovable the same #expression# continued
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ stopped him at the last named #sum# you are then in #possession# of #franc# asked the #notary#
yes in landed property no in stock yes the stock is in your own #hand#
the #look# which $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ cast on $barrois$ showed that there was #something# wanting which he knew where to find the old #servant# left the #room# and presently returned bringing with him a small casket
do you permit us to open this casket asked the #notary# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ gave his assent they opened it and found #franc# in bank scrip
the first #notary# handed over each #note# as he examined it to his colleague the total amount was found to be as $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had stated
it is all as he has said it is very evident that the #mind# still retains its full force and vigor
you possess then #franc# of capital which according to the #manner# in which you have invested it ought to bring in an income of about livres
then turning towards the paralytic he said yes to whom do you #desire# to leave this #fortune#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ tenderly loves his granddaughter $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ it is she who has nursed and tended him for six #year# and has by her devoted #attention# fully secured the affection i had almost said the gratitude of her #grandfather# and it is but just that she should reap the fruit of her devotion
the #eye# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ clearly showed by its #expression# that he was not deceived by the false assent given by #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #word# and #manner# to the motives which she supposed him to entertain
is it then to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ that you leave these #franc# demanded the #notary# thinking he had only to insert this clause but waiting first for the assent of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ which it was necessary should be given before all the witnesses of this singular #scene#
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ when her #name# was made the #subject# of discussion had stepped back to escape unpleasant observation her #eye# were cast down and she was crying
the old #man# looked at her for an #instant# with an #expression# of the deepest tenderness then turning towards the #notary# he significantly winked his #eye# in token of dissent
oh said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ there is not much #doubt# on that #subject# what said the #notary# do you not intend making $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ your residuary legatee
no you are not making any mistake are you said the #notary# you really #mean# to declare that such is not your intention
it was not so much the conviction that she was disinherited that caused her #grief# but her total inability to #account# for the #feeling# which had provoked her #grandfather# to such an act
no repeated $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ no $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ raised her #head# struck dumb with #astonishment# but $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that she exclaimed
oh grandpapa i see now that it is only your #fortune# of which you deprive me you still leave me the #love# which i have always enjoyed
ah yes most assuredly said the #eye# of the paralytic for he closed them with an #expression# which $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ could not mistake
the old #man# declaration that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was not the destined inheritor of his #fortune# had excited the #hope# of #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ she gradually approached the invalid and said
#thank# you #thank# you murmured she then doubtless dear $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ you intend leaving your #fortune# to your grandson $edward$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
the winking of the #eye# which answered this speech was most decided and terrible and expressed a #feeling# almost amounting to hatred
the two #notary# looked at each #other# in mute #astonishment# and inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the testator
no said the #notary# then perhaps it is to your #son# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ no $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and his #wife# both grew red #one# from shame the #other# from anger
what have we all done then dear grandpapa said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ you no longer seem to #love# any of us
the old #man# #eye# passed rapidly from $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and his #wife# and rested on $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ with a #look# of unutterable fondness
well said she if you #love# me grandpapa try and bring that #love# to bear upon your actions at this present #moment#
you know me well enough to be quite sure that i have never #thought# of your #fortune# besides they say i am already rich in #right# of my #mother# too rich even
explain yourself then $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ fixed his intelligent #eye# on $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #hand# my #hand# said she yes
her #hand# exclaimed #everyone# oh #gentleman# you see it is all useless and that my #father# #mind# is really impaired said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
ah cried $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ suddenly i understand it is my #marriage# you #mean# is it not dear grandpapa
yes yes yes signed the paralytic casting on $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ a #look# of joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning
you are angry with us all on #account# of this #marriage# are you not yes really this is too absurd said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
on the #contrary# the meaning of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ is quite evident to me and i can quite easily connect the train of #idea# passing in his #mind#
excuse me #sir# replied the #notary# you do not #wish# me to marry $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay observed $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
i do not #wish# it said the #eye# of her #grandfather# and you disinherit your granddaughter continued the #notary# because she has contracted an engagement #contrary# to your #wish#
yes so that but for this #marriage# she would have been your heir yes there was a profound #silence#
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was looking at her #grandfather# with a #smile# of intense gratitude and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was biting his #lip# with vexation while #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ could not succeed in repressing an inward #feeling# of #joy# which in #spite# of herself appeared in her whole #countenance#
the two #notary# were holding a consultation as to the best #mean# of proceeding with the #affair# but said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who was the first to break the #silence#
i consider that i am the best judge of the propriety of the #marriage# in #question# i am the only #person# possessing the #right# to dispose of my #daughter# #hand#
it is my #wish# that she should marry $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay and she shall marry him $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ sank weeping into a #chair#
#sir# said the #notary# how do you intend disposing of your #fortune# in #case# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ still determines on marrying $m_franz_de_quesnel$
the old #man# gave no #answer# you #will# of #course# dispose of it in some #way# or #other#
yes in favor of some member of your #family# no do you intend devoting it to charitable #purpose# then pursued the #notary#
yes but said the #notary# you are aware that the #law# does not allow a #son# to be entirely deprived of his patrimony
you only intend then to dispose of that #part# of your #fortune# which the #law# allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your #son#
yes $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ made no #answer# do you still #wish# to dispose of all yes but they #will# contest the #will# after your #death#
he is quite sure that his #wish# #will# be held sacred by me besides he understands that in my #position# i cannot plead against the poor
no my #father# knows me replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the #eye# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ beamed with triumph what do you decide on #sir# asked the #notary# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
#nothing# #sir# it is a resolution which my #father# has taken and i know he never alters his #mind# i am quite resigned
these #franc# #will# go out of the #family# in #order# to enrich some hospital but it is ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old #man# and i shall therefore act according to my conscience
having said this $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ quitted the #room# with his #wife# leaving his #father# at #liberty# to do as he pleased
the same #day# the #will# was made the witnesses were brought it was approved by the old #man# sealed in the #presence# of all and given in charge to deschamps the #family# #notary#
the telegraph and #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ found on their #return# that the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ who had come to #visit# them in their absence had been ushered into the #drawing# #room# and was still awaiting them there
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who had not yet sufficiently recovered from her late #emotion# to allow of her entertaining visitors so immediately retired to her bedroom while the #procureur# who could better depend upon himself proceeded at once to the salon
although $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ flattered himself that to all outward view he had completely masked the #feeling# which were passing in his #mind# he did not know that the cloud was still lowering on his #brow# so much so that the #count# whose #smile# was radiant immediately noticed his sombre and thoughtful #air#
#chapter# ma foi said $m_de_monte_cristo$ after the first compliments were over what is the #matter# with you $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
have i arrived at the #moment# when you were #drawing# up an indictment for a capital #crime# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ tried to #smile#
no #count# he replied i am the only victim in this #case# it is i who lose my cause and it is ill luck obstinacy and folly which have caused it to be decided against me
to what do you refer said $m_de_monte_cristo$ with well feigned #interest# have you really met with some great #misfortune#
oh no $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with a bitter #smile# it is only a loss of #money# which i have sustained
true said $m_de_monte_cristo$ the loss of a #sum# of #money# becomes almost immaterial with a #fortune# such as you possess and to #one# of your philosophic spirit
it is not so much the loss of the #money# that vexes me said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ though after all #franc# are worth regretting but i am the more annoyed with this fate #chance# or whatever you please to call the #power# which has destroyed my #hope# and my #fortune# and may blast the prospects of my #child# also as it is all occasioned by an old #man# relapsed into second childhood
#nothing# worth mentioning i assure you what do you say said the #count# #franc#
it is indeed a #sum# which might be regretted even by a philosopher and who is the cause of all this annoyance
my #father# as i told you $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ but i #thought# you told me he had become entirely paralyzed and that all his faculties were completely destroyed
yes his bodily faculties for he can neither move nor speak nevertheless he thinks acts and #will# in the #manner# i have described
i left him about five #minute# ago and he is now occupied in dictating his #will# to two #notary#
but to do this he must have spoken he has done better than that he has made himself understood
by the help of his #eye# which are still full of #life# and as you perceive possess the #power# of inflicting mortal injury
how was such a #thing# possible my dear said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who had just entered the #room#
perhaps you exaggerate the evil good #morning# #madame# said the #count# bowing #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ acknowledged the salutation with #one# of her most gracious #smile#
what is this that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ has been telling me demanded $m_de_monte_cristo$ and what incomprehensible #misfortune# incomprehensible is the #word#
interrupted the #procureur# shrugging his #shoulder# it is an old #man# caprice and is there no #mean# of making him revoke his decision
it is still entirely in the #power# of my #husband# to cause the #will# which is now in prejudice of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ to be altered in her favor
the #count# who perceived that and #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ were beginning to speak in parables appeared to pay no #attention# to the #conversation# and feigned to be busily engaged in watching $edward$ who was mischievously pouring some ink into the bird #water# #glass#
you know i have never been accustomed to play the patriarch in my #family# nor have i ever considered that the fate of a universe was to be decided by my nod
nevertheless it is necessary that my #will# should be respected in my #family# and that the folly of an old #man# and the caprice of a #child# should not be allowed to overturn a project which i have entertained for so many #year#
the #baron# épinay was my #friend# as you know and an alliance with his #son# is the most suitable #thing# that could possibly be arranged
yes said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and my dear said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in #answer# to his #wife#
she has always been opposed to this #marriage# and i should not be at all surprised if what we have just seen and heard is #nothing# but the execution of a #plan# concerted between them
do you think said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ is in league with him #madame# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ believe me a #fortune# of #franc# is not so easily renounced
she could nevertheless make up her #mind# to renounce the #world# #sir# since it is only about a #year# ago that she herself proposed entering a convent
never #mind# replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i say that this #marriage# shall be consummated notwithstanding your #father# #wish# to the #contrary# said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ selecting a new #point# of attack
that is a serious #thing# $m_de_monte_cristo$ who pretended not to be listening heard however every #word# that was said
i can truly say that i have always entertained a high respect for my #father# because to the natural #feeling# of relationship was added the consciousness of his moral superiority
the #name# of #father# is sacred in two senses he should be reverenced as the author of our being and as a #master# whom we ought to obey
but under the present #circumstance# i am justified in doubting the wisdom of an old #man# who because he hated the #father# vents his anger on the #son#
i shall still continue to preserve the same respect toward $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i #will# suffer without complaint the pecuniary deprivation to which he has subjected me but i shall remain firm in my determination and the #world# shall see which party has #reason# on his #side#
consequently i shall marry my #daughter# to the #baron# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay because i consider it would be a proper and eligible match for her to make and in short because i choose to bestow my #daughter# #hand# on whomever
#madame# replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ it would be ridiculous in me to regulate my conduct by such caprices i please
do you say that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ disinherits $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ because she is going to marry le #baron# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay
what said the #count# the approbation of whose #eye# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had frequently solicited during this speech what
yes #sir# that is the #reason# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ shrugging his #shoulder# the apparent #reason# at least said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
the real #reason# #madame# i can assure you i know my #father# but i want to know in what #way# $m_franz_d_épinay$ can have displeased your #father# more than any #other# #person#
i believe i know $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay said the #count# is he not the #son# of general $m_franz_de_quesnel$ who was created #baron# épinay by charles
the same said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ well but he is a charming young #man# according to my #idea#
he is which makes me believe that it is only an excuse of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ to prevent his granddaughter marrying old #man# are always so selfish in their affection said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
but said $m_de_monte_cristo$ do you not know any cause for this hatred ah ma foi
who is to know perhaps it is some political difference my #father# and the #baron# épinay lived in the stormy #time# of which i only saw the ending said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
was not your #father# a bonapartist asked $m_de_monte_cristo$ i think i remember that you told me #something# of that kind
my #father# has been a jacobin more than #anything# else said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ carried by his #emotion# beyond the bounds of prudence
and the senator robe which $napoleon$ cast on his #shoulder# only served to disguise the old #man# without in any degree changing him
when my #father# conspired it was not for the emperor it was against the bourbons for $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ possessed this peculiarity he never projected any utopian schemes which could never be realized but strove for possibilities and he applied to the realization of these possibilities the terrible theories of the mountain theories that never shrank from any #mean# that were deemed necessary to bring about the desired result
well said $m_de_monte_cristo$ it is just as i #thought# it was politics which brought $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and $m_franz_d_épinay$ into personal contact
and was he not the #person# who was assassinated #one# #evening# on leaving a bonapartist meeting to which he had been invited on the supposition that he favored the cause of the emperor
although general épinay served under $napoleon$ did he not still retain royalist sentiments $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looked at the #count# almost with #terror#
am i mistaken then said $m_de_monte_cristo$ no #sir# the #fact# were precisely what you have stated said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
and it was to prevent the renewal of old feuds that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ formed the #idea# of uniting in the bonds of affection the two #child# of these inveterate #enemy#
it was a sublime and charitable #thought# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ and the whole #world# should applaud it it would be noble to see $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ assuming the title of #madame# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ shuddered and looked at $m_de_monte_cristo$ as if he wished to read in his #countenance# the real #feeling# which had dictated the #word# he had just uttered
but the #count# completely baffled the #procureur# and prevented him from discovering #anything# beneath the never varying #smile# he was so constantly in the habit of assuming
although said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ it #will# be a serious #thing# for $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ to lose her #grandfather# #fortune# i do not think that $m_franz_d_épinay$ #will# be frightened at this pecuniary loss
he #will# perhaps hold me in greater esteem than the #money# itself seeing that i sacrifice #everything# in #order# to keep my #word# with him
besides he knows that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ is rich in #right# of her #mother# and that she #will# in all probability inherit the #fortune# of and $madame_de_saint_méran$ her #mother# parents who both #love# her tenderly
besides they are to come to paris in about a #month# and $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ after the affront she has received need not consider it necessary to continue to bury herself alive by being shut up with $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
and who are fully as well worth loving and tending as $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
the #count# listened with satisfaction to this tale of wounded self #love# and defeated ambition but it seems to me said $m_de_monte_cristo$
and i must begin by asking your pardon for what i am about to say that if $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ disinherits $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ because she is going to marry a #man# whose #father# he detested he cannot have the same cause of complaint against this dear $edward$
said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with an intonation of #voice# which it is impossible to describe is it not unjust shamefully unjust
poor $edward$ is as much $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ grandchild as $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and yet if she had not been going to marry $m_franz_de_quesnel$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ would have left her all his #money# and supposing $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ to be disinherited by her #grandfather# she #will# still be three #time# richer than he
true the #count# listened and said no more #count# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ we #will# not entertain you any longer with our #family# #misfortune#
it is true that my patrimony #will# go to endow charitable institutions and my #father# #will# have deprived me of my lawful inheritance without any #reason# for doing so but i shall have the satisfaction of knowing that i have acted like a #man# of sense and #feeling#
m épinay to whom i had promised the #interest# of this #sum# shall receive it even if i endure the most cruel privations
however said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ returning to the #one# #idea# which incessantly occupied her #mind# perhaps it would be better to explain this unlucky #affair# to $m_franz_d_épinay$ in #order# to give him the opportunity of himself renouncing his claim to the #hand# of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
ah that would be a great #pity# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ a great #pity# said $m_de_monte_cristo$
a #marriage# once concerted and then broken off throws a #sort# of discredit on a young #lady# then again the old reports which i was so anxious to put an #end# to #will# instantly gain #ground#
no it #will# all go well $m_franz_d_épinay$ if he is an honorable #man# #will# consider himself more than ever pledged to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ unless he were actuated by a decided #feeling# of avarice but that is impossible
undoubtedly said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ moderating the #tone# of his #voice# i agree with $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ said $m_de_monte_cristo$ fixing his #eye# on #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
and if i were sufficiently intimate with him to allow of giving my advice i would persuade him since i have been told $m_franz_d_épinay$ is coming back to settle this #affair# at once beyond all possibility of revocation
i #will# #answer# for the success of a project which #will# reflect so much #honor# on $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
well that is all that i wanted and i #will# be guided by a counsellor such as you are said he extending his #hand# to $m_de_monte_cristo$
therefore let #everyone# here #look# upon what has passed #today# as if it had not happened and as though we had never #thought# of such a #thing# as a change in our original #plan#
#sir# said the #count# the #world# unjust as it is #will# be pleased with your resolution your #friend# #will# be proud of you and $m_franz_d_épinay$ even if he took $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ without any dowry which he #will# not do would be delighted with the #idea# of entering a #family# which could make such sacrifices in #order# to keep a #promise# and fulfil a #duty#
the #procureur# arose delighted with the proposition but his #wife# slightly changed color at the conclusion of these #word# the #count# rose to depart
are you going to leave us #count# said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i am sorry to say i must do so #madame#
i only came to remind you of your #promise# for saturday did you #fear# that we should forget it
you are very good #madame# but $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ has so many important and urgent occupations my #husband# has given me his #word# #sir# said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
you have just seen him resolve to keep it when he has #everything# to lose and surely there is more #reason# for his doing so where he has #everything# to gain
and said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ is it at your $house_of_peers$ in the champs élysées that you receive your visitors no said $m_de_monte_cristo$ which is precisely the #reason# which renders your kindness more meritorious it is in the #country#
in the #country# yes where is it then near paris is it not very near only #half# a league from the barriers it is at $auteuil$
at $auteuil$ said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ true #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ told me you lived at $auteuil$ since it was to your $house_of_peers$ that she was taken
and in what #part# of $auteuil$ do you reside rue de la fontaine rue de la fontaine exclaimed $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in an agitated #tone#
at what number no then cried $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was it you who bought de $madame_de_saint_méran$ $house_of_peers$
did it belong to de $madame_de_saint_méran$ demanded $m_de_monte_cristo$ yes replied #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and would you believe it #count# believe what
you think this $house_of_peers$ pretty do you not i think it charming well my #husband# would never live in it
indeed returned $m_de_monte_cristo$ that is a prejudice on your #part# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ for which i am quite at a loss to #account#
but i #hope# you #will# not carry your antipathy so far as to deprive me of the #pleasure# of your company #sir# said $m_de_monte_cristo$
i do not like $auteuil$ #sir# said the #procureur# making an evident #effort# to appear calm no #count# i #hope#
i assure you i shall do my best stammered $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ oh said $m_de_monte_cristo$ i allow of no excuse
on saturday at six clock i shall be expecting you and if you fail to come i shall think for how do i know to the #contrary# that
this $house_of_peers$ which has remained uninhabited for twenty #year# must have some gloomy tradition or dreadful legend connected with it
i #will# come #count# i #will# be sure to come said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ eagerly #thank# you said $m_de_monte_cristo$ now you must permit me to take my leave of you
you said before that you were obliged to leave us $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and you were about to tell us why when your #attention# was called to some #other# #subject#
indeed #madame# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ i scarcely know if i dare tell you where i am going
nonsense say on well then it is to see a #thing# on which i have sometimes mused for #hour# together
what is it a telegraph so now i have told my #secret# a telegraph repeated #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
i had often seen #one# placed at the #end# of a #road# on a hillock and in the #light# of the sun its black #arm# bending in every direction always reminded me of the claws of an immense beetle and i assure you it was never without #emotion# that i gazed on it for i could not help thinking how wonderful it was that these various #sign# should be made to cleave the #air# with such precision as to convey to the #distance# of three hundred leagues the #idea# and #wish# of a #man# sitting at a #table# at #one# #end# of the #line# to another #man# similarly placed at the opposite extremity and all this effected by a simple act of volition on the #part# of the sender of the message
i began to think of genii sylphs gnomes in short of all the #minister# of the occult sciences until i laughed aloud at the freaks of my own imagination
now it never occurred to me to #wish# for a nearer inspection of these large insects with their long black claws for i always feared to find under their #stone# wings some little human genius fagged to #death# with cabals factions and government intrigues
but #one# fine #day# i learned that the mover of this telegraph was only a poor wretch hired for twelve hundred #franc# a #year# and employed all #day# not in studying the heavens like an astronomer or in gazing on the #water# like an angler or even in enjoying the privilege of observing the #country# around him but all his monotonous #life# was passed in watching his white bellied black clawed #fellow# insect four or five leagues distant from him
at #length# i felt a #desire# to #study# this living chrysalis more closely and to endeavor to understand the #secret# #part# played by these insect actors when they occupy themselves simply with pulling different #piece# of string
yes a telegraph and are you going there i am what telegraph do you intend visiting
oh no i should find there #people# who would force me to understand #thing# of which i would prefer to remain ignorant and who would try to explain to me in #spite# of myself a mystery which even they do not understand
i should #wish# to keep my illusions concerning insects unimpaired it is quite enough to have those dissipated which i had formed of my #fellow# creatures
i shall therefore not #visit# either of these telegraphs but #one# in the open #country# where i shall find a good natured simpleton who knows no more than the machine he is employed to #work#
that of the home department or of the observatory ma foi you are a singular #man# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
what #line# would you advise me to #study# the #one# that is most in #use# just at this #time#
the spanish #one# you #mean# i suppose yes should you like a #letter# to the #minister# that they might explain to you
the #moment# i understand it there #will# no longer exist a telegraph for me it #will# be #nothing# more than a #sign# from duchâtel or from montalivet transmitted to the prefect of bayonne mystified by two greek #word# têle graphein
it is the insect with black claws and the awful #word# which i #wish# to retain in my imagination in all its purity and all its importance
go then for in the #course# of two #hour# it #will# be dark and you #will# not be able to see #anything#
no said $m_de_monte_cristo$ since as i told you before i do not #wish# to comprehend it
ma foi you frighten me which is the nearest #way# bayonne yes the #road# to bayonne and afterwards the #road# to châtillon
yes by the tower of montlhéry you #mean# yes #thank# you good bye on saturday i #will# tell you my impressions concerning the telegraph
at the #door# the #count# was met by the two #notary# who had just completed the act which was to disinherit $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and who were leaving under the conviction of having done a #thing# which could not fail of redounding considerably to their credit
may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches not on the same #night# as he had stated but the next #morning# the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ went out by the barrière enfer taking the #road# to orléans
leaving the village of linas without stopping at the telegraph which flourished its great bony #arm# as he passed the #count# reached the tower of montlhéry situated as #everyone# knows upon the highest #point# of the plain of that #name#
at the #foot# of the hill the #count# dismounted and began to ascend by a little winding path about eighteen inches wide when he reached the summit he found himself stopped by a hedge upon which green fruit had succeeded to red and white flowers
$m_de_monte_cristo$ looked for the entrance to the enclosure and was not long in finding a little wooden #gate# working on willow hinges and fastened with a nail and string
the #count# soon mastered the mechanism the #gate# opened and he then found himself in a little #garden# about twenty #foot# long by twelve wide bounded on #one# #side# by #part# of the hedge which contained the ingenious contrivance we have called a #gate# and on the #other# by the old tower covered with ivy and studded with #wall# flowers
no #one# would have #thought# in looking at this old weather beaten floral decked tower which might be likened to an elderly dame dressed up to receive her grandchildren at a birthday feast that it would have been capable of telling strange #thing# if in addition to the menacing ears which the proverb says all #wall# are provided with it had also a #voice#
the #garden# was crossed by a path of red gravel edged by a border of thick #box# of many #year# growth and of a #tone# and color that would have delighted the #heart# of delacroix our modern rubens
this path was formed in the shape of the figure of thus in its windings making a walk of sixty #foot# in a #garden# of only twenty
never had flora the fresh and smiling goddess of gardeners been honored with a purer or more scrupulous worship than that which was paid to her in this little enclosure
in #fact# of the twenty rose #tree# which formed the parterre not #one# bore the mark of the slug nor were there evidences anywhere of the clustering aphis which is so destructive to plants growing in a damp soil
and yet it was not because the damp had been excluded from the #garden# the #earth# black as soot the thick foliage of the #tree# betrayed its #presence# besides had natural humidity been wanting it could have been immediately supplied by artificial #mean# #thank# to a tank of #water# sunk in #one# of the #corner# of the #garden# and upon which were stationed a frog and a toad who from antipathy no #doubt# always remained on the two opposite #side# of the basin
there was not a blade of grass to be seen in the paths or a weed in the flower #bed# no fine #lady# ever trained and watered her geraniums her cacti and her rhododendrons in her porcelain jardinière with more pains than this hitherto unseen gardener bestowed upon his little enclosure
#chapter# how a gardener $m_de_monte_cristo$ stopped after having closed the #gate# and fastened the string to the nail and cast a #look# around
suddenly he struck against #something# crouching behind a wheelbarrow filled with leaves the #something# rose uttering an exclamation of #astonishment# and $m_de_monte_cristo$ found himself facing a #man# about fifty #year# old who was plucking strawberries which he was placing upon grape leaves
the #man# at the telegraph said he must either engage a gardener or devote himself passionately to agriculture he had twelve leaves and about as many strawberries which on rising suddenly he let fall from his #hand#
you are gathering your crop #sir# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ smiling excuse me #sir# replied the #man# raising his #hand# to his cap
do not let me interfere with you in #anything# my #friend# said the #count# gather your strawberries if indeed there are any left
i am not up there i know but i have only just come down i have ten left said the #man# for here are eleven and i had twenty #one# five more than last #year#
this is the #reason# that instead of the sixteen i had last #year# i have this #year# you see eleven already plucked twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen
but i am not surprised the spring has been warm this #year# and strawberries require heat #sir# ah i miss three they were here last #night#
#sir# i am sure they were here i counted them it must be the #son# of mère simon who has stolen them i saw him strolling about here this #morning#
ah the young rascal stealing in a #garden# he does not know where that may lead him to certainly it is wrong said $m_de_monte_cristo$
but you should take into consideration the youth and greediness of the delinquent of #course# said the gardener
but that does not make it the less unpleasant but #sir# once more i beg pardon perhaps you are an #officer# that i am detaining here
calm yourself my #friend# said the #count# with the #smile# which he made at #will# either terrible or benevolent and which now expressed only the kindliest #feeling#
i am not an #inspector# but a #traveller# brought here by a curiosity he #half# repents of since he causes you to lose your #time#
and he glanced timidly at the #count# blue coat ah my #time# is not valuable replied the #man# with a melancholy #smile#
still it belongs to government and i ought not to waste it but having received the signal that i might #rest# for an #hour#
here he glanced at the sun dial for there was #everything# in the enclosure of montlhéry even a sun dial and having ten #minute# before me and my strawberries being ripe
indeed i should think not replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ dormice are bad neighbors for us who do not eat them preserved as the romans did
when a #day# longer by the by #sir# do you think dormice eat them what did the romans eat them said the gardener ate dormice
i have read so in petronius said the #count# really they cant be nice though they do say as fat as a dormouse
it is not a wonder they are fat sleeping all #day# and only waking to eat all #night# listen last #year# i had four apricots
they stole #one# i had #one# nectarine only #one# well #sir# they ate #half# of it on the #wall# a splendid nectarine
i never ate a better you ate it that is to say the #half# that was left
you understand it was exquisite #sir# ah those #gentleman# never choose the worst morsels like mère simon #son# who has not chosen the worst strawberries
it shall not happen even if i should be forced to sit by the whole #night# to watch when the strawberries are ripe
every #man# has a devouring passion in his #heart# as every fruit has its worm that of the telegraph #man# was horticulture
but this #year# continued the horticulturist i ll take #care# $m_de_monte_cristo$ had seen enough he began gathering the grape leaves which screened the sun from the grapes and won the #heart# of the gardener
did you come here #sir# to see the telegraph he said yes if it isnt #contrary# to the rules
oh no said the gardener not in the least since there is no danger that #anyone# can possibly understand what we are saying
i have been told said the #count# that you do not always yourselves understand the signals you repeat
that is true #sir# and that is what i like best said the #man# smiling why do you like that best
because then i have no responsibility i am a machine then and #nothing# else and so long as i #work# #nothing# more is required of me
is it possible said $m_de_monte_cristo$ to himself that i can have met with a #man# that has no ambition
that would spoil my #plan# #sir# said the gardener glancing at the sun dial the ten #minute# are almost up i must #return# to my post
#will# you go up with me i follow you $m_de_monte_cristo$ entered the tower which was divided into three #story#
the tower contained implements such as spades rakes watering pots hung against the #wall# this was all the furniture the second was the #man# conventional abode or rather sleeping #place# it contained
a few poor articles of household furniture a #bed# a #table# two #chair# a #stone# pitcher and some dry herbs hung up to the ceiling which the #count# recognized as sweet peas and of which the good #man# was preserving the seeds he had labelled them with as much #care# as if he had been #master# botanist in the jardin des plantes
does it require much #study# to learn the art of telegraphing asked $m_de_monte_cristo$ the #study# does not take long it was acting as a supernumerary that was so tedious
and what is the pay a thousand #franc# #sir# it is #nothing# no but then we are lodged as you perceive
$m_de_monte_cristo$ looked at the #room# they passed to the third #story# it was the telegraph #room# $m_de_monte_cristo$ looked in #turn# at the two #iron# handles by which the machine was worked
at first my neck was cramped with looking at it but at the #end# of a #year# i became used to it and then we have our #hour# of recreation and our holidays
it is very interesting he said but it must be very tedious for a lifetime yes
holidays yes when when we have a fog ah to be sure those are indeed holidays to me i go into the #garden# i plant
i prune i trim i kill the insects all #day# long how long have you been here
ten #year# and five as a supernumerary make fifteen you are fifty five #year# old how long must you have served to claim the pension
oh #sir# twenty five #year# and how much is the pension a hundred crowns poor humanity
murmured $m_de_monte_cristo$ what did you say #sir# asked the #man# i was saying it was very interesting
what was all you were showing me and you really understand none of these signals none at all
and have you never tried to understand them never why should i but still there are some signals only addressed to you
certainly and do you understand them they are always the same and they #mean#
#nothing# new you have an #hour# or #tomorrow# this is simple enough said the #count#
but #look# is not your correspondent putting itself in motion ah yes #thank# you #sir# and what is it saying #anything# you understand
by the same #sign# which at the same #time# tells my #right# #hand# correspondent that i am ready while it gives notice to my left #hand# correspondent to prepare in his #turn#
yes it asks if i am ready and you reply it is very ingenious said the #count#
you #will# see said the #man# proudly in five #minute# he #will# speak i have then five #minute# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ to himself
it is more #time# than i require my dear #sir# #will# you allow me to ask you a #question#
what is it #sir# you are fond of gardening passionately and you would be pleased to have instead of this terrace of twenty #foot# an enclosure of two acres
#sir# i should make a terrestrial paradise of it you live badly on your thousand #franc# badly enough
but yet i do live yes but you have a wretchedly small #garden# true the #garden# is not large
and then such as it is it is filled with dormice who eat #everything# ah they are my scourges
tell me should you have the #misfortune# to #turn# your #head# while your #right# #hand# correspondent was telegraphing i should not see him
then what would happen i could not repeat the signals and then not having repeated them through negligence i should be fined
how much a hundred #franc# the tenth of your income that would be fine #work#
ah said the #man# has it ever happened to you said $m_de_monte_cristo$ once #sir# when i was grafting a rose #tree#
well suppose you were to alter a signal and substitute another ah that is another #case# i should be turned off and lose my pension
three hundred #franc# a hundred crowns yes #sir# so you see that i am not likely to do any of these #thing#
not even for fifteen #year# wages come it is worth thinking about for fifteen thousand #franc# yes
#sir# you alarm me nonsense #sir# you are tempting me just so fifteen thousand #franc# do you understand
#sir# let me see my #right# #hand# correspondent on the #contrary# do not #look# at him but at this
what is it what do you not know these bits of #paper# bank #note# exactly there are fifteen of them
and whose are they yours if you like mine exclaimed the #man# #half# suffocated yes yours your own property
#sir# my #right# #hand# correspondent is signalling let him signal #sir# you have distracted me i shall be fined
that #will# cost you a hundred #franc# you see it is your #interest# to take my bank #note# #sir# my #right# #hand# correspondent redoubles his signals he is impatient
never #mind# take these and the #count# placed the packet in the #man# #hand# now this is not all he said you cannot live upon your fifteen thousand #franc#
i shall still have my #place# no you #will# lose it for you are going to alter your correspondent message
#sir# unless you force me i think i can effectually force you and $m_de_monte_cristo$ drew another packet from his #pocket#
here are ten thousand more #franc# he said with the fifteen thousand already in your #pocket# they #will# make twenty five thousand
with five thousand you can buy a pretty little $house_of_peers$ with two acres of land the remaining twenty thousand #will# bring you in a thousand #franc# a #year#
oh #sir# what are you proposing a jest a #garden# with two acres of land
and a thousand #franc# a #year# oh heavens come take them and $m_de_monte_cristo$ forced the bank #note# into his #hand#
what am i to do #nothing# very difficult but what is it to repeat these #sign#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ took a #paper# from his #pocket# upon which were drawn three #sign# with numbers to indicate the #order# in which they were to be worked
there you see it #will# not take long yes but do this and you #will# have nectarines and all the #rest#
the shot told red with fever while the large drops fell from his #brow# the #man# executed #one# after the #other# the three #sign# given by the #count# in #spite# of the frightful contortions of the #right# #hand# correspondent who not understanding the change began to think the gardener had gone mad
as to the left #hand# #one# he conscientiously repeated the same signals which were finally transmitted to the #minister# of the interior
now you are rich said $m_de_monte_cristo$ yes replied the #man# but at what a price
i do not #wish# to cause you any remorse believe me then when i swear to you that you have wronged no #man# but on the #contrary# have benefited mankind
the #man# looked at the bank #note# felt them counted them turned pale then red then rushed into his #room# to drink a #glass# of #water# but he had no #time# to reach the #water# jug and fainted in the midst of his dried herbs
five #minute# after the new telegram reached the #minister# $m_lucien_debray$ had the #horse# put to his #carriage# and drove to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $house_of_peers$
listen #friend# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ has your #husband# any spanish bonds he asked of the #baroness# i think so indeed
he has six #million# worth he must sell them at whatever price why because $don_carlos$ has fled from bourges and has returned to spain
how do you know $m_lucien_debray$ shrugged his #shoulder# the #idea# of asking how i hear the news he said
the #baroness# did not wait for a repetition she ran to her #husband# who immediately hastened to his agent and ordered him to sell at any price
when it was seen that $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ sold the spanish funds fell directly $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ lost five hundred thousand #franc# but he rid himself of all his spanish shares
the #king# $don_carlos$ has escaped the vigilance of his guardians at bourges and has returned to spain by the catalonian frontier
the same #evening# the following was read in le messager by telegraph barcelona has risen in his favor
all that #evening# #nothing# was spoken of but the foresight of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who had sold his shares and of the luck of the stock jobber who only lost five hundred thousand #franc# by such a blow
those who had kept their shares or bought those of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ looked upon themselves as ruined and passed a very bad #night#
next #morning# le moniteur contained the following it was without any foundation that le messager #yesterday# announced the flight of $don_carlos$ and the revolt of barcelona
the #king# $don_carlos$ has not left bourges and the peninsula is in the enjoyment of profound peace a telegraphic signal improperly interpreted owing to the fog was the cause of this error
the funds rose #one# per cent higher than before they had fallen this reckoning his loss and what he had missed gaining made the difference of a #million# to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
good said $m_de_monte_cristo$ to $m_maximilian_morrel$ who was at his $house_of_peers$ when the news arrived of the strange reverse of #fortune# of which $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had been the victim i have just made a discovery for twenty five thousand #franc# for which i would have paid a hundred thousand
what have you discovered asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ i have just discovered how a gardener may get rid of the dormice that eat his peaches
at first #sight# the exterior of the $house_of_peers$ at $auteuil$ gave no indications of splendor #nothing# #one# would expect from the destined residence of the magnificent #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ but this simplicity was according to the #will# of its #master# who positively ordered #nothing# to be altered outside
#chapter# ghosts the splendor was within indeed almost before the #door# opened the #scene# changed $m_bertuccio$ had outdone himself in the taste displayed in furnishing and in the rapidity with which it was executed
it is told that the duc antin removed in a single #night# a whole avenue of #tree# that annoyed $louis_xviii$ xiv
in three #day# $m_bertuccio$ planted an entirely bare #court# with poplars large spreading sycamores to shade the different #part# of the $house_of_peers$ and in the foreground instead of the usual paving #stone# #half# hidden by the grass there extended a lawn but that #morning# laid down and upon which the #water# was yet glistening
for the #rest# the #order# had been issued by the #count# he himself had given a #plan# to $m_bertuccio$ marking the #spot# where each #tree# was to be planted and the shape and extent of the lawn which was to take the #place# of the paving #stone#
thus the $house_of_peers$ had become unrecognizable and $m_bertuccio$ himself declared that he scarcely knew it encircled as it was by a framework of #tree#
the overseer would not have objected while he was about it to have made some improvements in the #garden# but the #count# had positively forbidden it to be touched
what above all manifested the shrewdness of the steward and the profound science of the #master# the #one# in carrying out the #idea# of the #other# was that this $house_of_peers$ which appeared only the #night# before so sad and gloomy impregnated with that sickly smell #one# can almost fancy to be the smell of #time# had in a single #day# acquired the aspect of #life# was scented with its #master# favorite perfumes and had the very #light# regulated according to his #wish#
when the #count# arrived he had under his touch his books and #arm# his #eye# rested upon his favorite pictures his dogs whose caresses he loved welcomed him in the antechamber the birds whose songs delighted him cheered him with their music and the $house_of_peers$ awakened from its long sleep like the sleeping beauty in the wood lived sang and bloomed like the #house# we have long cherished and in which when we are forced to leave them we leave a #part# of our souls
the #servant# passed gayly along the fine courtyard some belonging to the kitchens gliding down the stairs restored but the previous #day# as if they had always inhabited the $house_of_peers$ #other# filling the coach #house# where the equipages encased and numbered appeared to have been installed for the last fifty #year# and in the stables the #horse# replied with neighs to the grooms who spoke to them with much more respect than many #servant# pay their #master#
the library was divided into two #part# on either #side# of the #wall# and contained upwards of two thousand volumes #one# division was entirely devoted to novels and even the volume which had been published but the #day# before was to be seen in its #place# in all the dignity of its red and #gold# binding
on the #other# #side# of the $house_of_peers$ to match with the library was the conservatory ornamented with rare flowers that bloomed in china jars and in the midst of the greenhouse marvellous alike to #sight# and smell was a billiard #table# which looked as if it had been abandoned during the past #hour# by players who had left the balls on the cloth
$m_bertuccio$ made amends however by loading the antechambers #staircase# and mantle #piece# with flowers #one# #chamber# alone had been respected by the magnificent $m_bertuccio$
before this #room# to which you could ascend by the grand and go out by the back #staircase# the #servant# passed with curiosity and $m_bertuccio$ with #terror#
$m_bertuccio$ was awaiting this arrival with impatience mingled with uneasiness he hoped for some compliments while at the same #time# he feared to have frowns
$m_de_monte_cristo$ descended into the courtyard walked all over the $house_of_peers$ without giving any #sign# of approbation or #pleasure# until he entered his bedroom situated on the opposite #side# to the closed #room# then he approached a little #piece# of furniture made of rosewood which he had noticed at a previous #visit#
at five clock precisely the #count# arrived before the $house_of_peers$ at $auteuil$ followed by $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ that can only be to hold gloves he said
#will# your #excellency# deign to open it said the delighted $m_bertuccio$ and you #will# find gloves in it
good he said and $m_bertuccio$ left enraptured so great so powerful and real was the influence exercised by this #man# over all who surrounded him
at precisely six clock the clatter of #horse# hoofs was heard at the entrance #door# it was our #captain# of spahis who had arrived on médéah
elsewhere the #count# found #everything# he required smelling bottles cigars knick knacks i am sure i am the first cried $m_maximilian_morrel$
i did it on #purpose# to have you a #minute# to myself before #everyone# came $mademoiselle_julie$ and $m_emmanuel$ have a thousand #thing# to tell you
ah really this is magnificent but tell me #count# #will# your #people# take #care# of my #horse# do not alarm yourself my dear $m_maximilian_morrel$ they understand
i #mean# because he wants petting if you had seen at what a pace he came like the wind
i should think so a #horse# that cost #franc# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ in the #tone# which a #father# would #use# towards a #son#
do you regret them asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ with his open laugh i certainly not replied the #count#
it is so good that i have distanced de $baron_de_château_renaud$ #one# of the best riders in france and $m_lucien_debray$ who both mount the #minister# arabians and close on their heels are the #horse# of #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who always go at six leagues an #hour#
no i should only regret if the #horse# had not proved good then they follow you asked $m_de_monte_cristo$
and at the same #minute# a #carriage# with smoking #horse# accompanied by two mounted #gentleman# arrived at the #gate# which opened before them
see they are here the #carriage# drove round and stopped at the #step# followed by the horsemen the #instant# $m_lucien_debray$ had touched the #ground# he was at the #carriage# #door#
he offered his #hand# to the #baroness# who descending took it with a peculiarity of #manner# imperceptible to #everyone# but $m_de_monte_cristo$
but #nothing# escaped the #count# notice and he observed a little #note# passed with the facility that indicates frequent practice from the #hand# of #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to that of the #minister# secretary
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ threw a rapid and inquiring #glance# which could only be interpreted by $m_de_monte_cristo$ around the courtyard over the peristyle and across the front of the $house_of_peers$ then repressing a slight #emotion# which must have been seen on her #countenance# if she had not kept her color she ascended the #step# saying to $m_maximilian_morrel$
after his #wife# the #banker# descended as pale as though he had issued from his tomb instead of his #carriage#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ smiled with an #expression# very like a grimace and then turned round to $m_de_monte_cristo$ as if to ask him to extricate him from his embarrassment
#sir# if you were a #friend# of mine i should ask you if you would sell your #horse# the #count# understood him
ah #madame# he said why did you not make that request of me with you #sir# replied the #baroness# #one# can #wish# for #nothing# #one# is so sure to obtain it
if it were so with $m_maximilian_morrel$ unfortunately replied the #count# i am witness that $m_maximilian_morrel$ cannot give up his #horse# his #honor# being engaged in keeping it
you understand now that if he were to get rid of the animal before the #time# named he would not only lose his bet but #people# would say he was afraid and a brave #captain# of spahis cannot risk this even to gratify a pretty #woman# which is in my #opinion# #one# of the most sacred obligations in the #world#
how so he laid a wager he would tame médéah in the space of six #month#
it seems to me said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ in his coarse #tone# ill concealed by a forced #smile# that you have already got #horse# enough
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ seldom allowed remarks of this kind to pass unnoticed but to the surprise of the young #people# she pretended not to hear it and said #nothing#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ smiled at her unusual humility and showed her two immense porcelain jars over which wound marine plants of a size and delicacy that #nature# alone could produce
you see my #position# #madame# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ bestowing a grateful #smile# on $m_de_monte_cristo$ the #baroness# was astonished
why said she you could plant #one# of the chestnut #tree# in the tuileries inside how can such enormous jars have been manufactured
ah #madame# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ you must not ask of us the manufacturers of fine porcelain such a #question# it is the #work# of another #age# constructed by the genii of #earth# and #water#
i do not know i have only heard that an emperor of china had an oven built expressly and that in this oven twelve jars like this were successively baked
how so at what period can that have been two broke from the heat of the #fire# the #other# ten were sunk three hundred fathoms deep into the #sea#
the #sea# knowing what was required of her threw over them her weeds encircled them with coral and encrusted them with shells the whole was cemented by two hundred #year# beneath these almost impervious depths for a revolution carried away the emperor who wished to make the trial and only left the documents proving the manufacture of the jars and their descent into the #sea#
divers descended in machines made expressly on the discovery into the bay where they were thrown but of ten three only remained the #rest# having been broken by the waves
i am fond of these jars upon which perhaps misshapen frightful monsters have fixed their cold dull #eye# and in which myriads of small fish have slept seeking a refuge from the pursuit of their #enemy#
meanwhile $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who had cared little for curiosities was mechanically tearing off the blossoms of a splendid orange #tree# #one# after another
when he had finished with the orange #tree# he began at the cactus but this not being so easily plucked as the orange #tree# pricked him dreadfully
at the #end# of two hundred #year# the documents were found and they #thought# of bringing up the jars he shuddered and rubbed his #eye# as though awaking from a #dream#
i do not recommend my pictures to you who possess such splendid paintings but nevertheless here are two by hobbema a paul potter a mieris two by gerard douw a raphael a van dyck a zurbaran and two or three by murillo worth looking at
#sir# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ to him stay said $m_lucien_debray$ i recognize this hobbema ah indeed
yes it was proposed for the museum which i believe does not contain #one# said $m_de_monte_cristo$
no and yet they refused to buy it why said $baron_de_château_renaud$ you pretend not to know because government was not rich enough
ah pardon me said $baron_de_château_renaud$ i have heard of these #thing# every #day# during the last eight #year# and i cannot understand them yet
you #will# by and by said $m_lucien_debray$ i think not replied $baron_de_château_renaud$ major $bartolomeo_cavalcanti$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ and #count# $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ announced $monsieur_baptistin$
a black satin stock fresh from the maker #hand# gray moustaches a bold #eye# a major uniform ornamented with three medals and
the thorough bearing of an old #soldier# such was the #appearance# of major $bartolomeo_cavalcanti$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ that tender #father# with whom we are already acquainted
five crosses in #fact# close to him dressed in entirely new clothes advanced smilingly #count# $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ the dutiful #son# whom we also know
on the entrance of the new comers their #eye# glanced from #father# to #son# and then naturally enough rested on the latter whom they began criticising
the three young #people# were talking together $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said $m_lucien_debray$ a fine #name# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ yes said $baron_de_château_renaud$
these italians are well named and badly dressed you are fastidious $baron_de_château_renaud$ replied $m_lucien_debray$ those clothes are well cut and quite new
that is just what i find fault with that #gentleman# appears to be well dressed for the first #time# in his #life#
who are those #gentleman# asked $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ of $m_de_monte_cristo$ you heard $monsieur_cavalcanti$ that tells me their #name# and #nothing# else
ah true you do not know the italian nobility the $monsieur_cavalcanti$ are all descended from princes have they any #fortune#
an enormous #one# what do they do try to spend it all they have some #business# with you i think from what they told me the #day# before #yesterday#
i indeed invited them here #today# on your #account# i #will# introduce you to them but they appear to speak french with a very pure accent said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
the #son# has been educated in a college in the south i believe near marseilles you #will# find him quite enthusiastic
upon what #subject# asked #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ the french #lady# #madame# he has made up his #mind# to take a #wife# from paris
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ looked at her #husband# with an #expression# which at any #other# #time# would have indicated a storm but for the second #time# she controlled herself
a fine #idea# that of his said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ shrugging his #shoulder# the #baron# appears thoughtful #today# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ to her are they going to put him in the ministry
not yet i think more likely he has been speculating on the bourse and has lost #money# and #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ cried $monsieur_baptistin$
they entered $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ notwithstanding his self control was visibly affected and when $m_de_monte_cristo$ touched his #hand# he felt it tremble
certainly #woman# alone know how to dissimulate said $m_de_monte_cristo$ to himself glancing at #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who was smiling on the #procureur# and embracing his #wife#
after a short #time# the #count# saw $m_bertuccio$ who until then had been occupied on the #other# #side# of the $house_of_peers$ glide into an adjoining #room#
he went to him what do you want $m_bertuccio$ said he your #excellency# has not stated the number of #guest#
ah true how many covers #count# for yourself is #everyone# here your #excellency# yes
$m_bertuccio$ glanced through the #door# which was ajar the #count# watched him good heavens he exclaimed what is the #matter# said the #count#
that #woman# that #woman# which the #one# with a white dress and so many #diamond# the fair #one# #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
i do not know her #name# but it is she #sir# it is she whom do you #mean#
the #woman# of the #garden# she that was enceinte she who was walking while she waited for $m_bertuccio$ stood at the open #door# with his #eye# starting and his #hair# on #end#
waiting for whom $m_bertuccio$ without answering pointed to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with #something# of the gesture macbeth uses to #point# out banquo
oh oh he at #length# muttered do you see what who him him $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the #king# attorney
certainly i see him then i did not kill him really i think you are going mad good $m_bertuccio$ said the #count#
instead of striking between the sixth and seventh left ribs as your countrymen do you must have struck higher or lower and #life# is very tenacious in these lawyers or rather there is no #truth# in #anything# you have told me
then he is not dead no you see plainly he is not dead it was a fright of the imagination
a #dream# of your fancy you went to sleep full of #thought# of vengeance they weighed heavily upon your stomach you had the nightmare
come calm yourself and reckon them up and #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ two and #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ four de $baron_de_château_renaud$ $m_lucien_debray$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ seven major $bartolomeo_cavalcanti$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ eight
that all eight repeated $m_bertuccio$ stop you are in a shocking hurry to be off you forget #one# of my #guest#
lean a little to the left stay #look# at $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ the young #man# in a black coat looking at murillo madonna now he is turning
this #time# $m_bertuccio$ would have uttered an exclamation had not a #look# from $m_de_monte_cristo$ silenced him $m_benedetto$ he muttered
i ordered #dinner# at that #hour# and i do not like to wait and he returned to his #guest# while $m_bertuccio$ leaning against the #wall# succeeded in reaching the dining #room#
fatality #half# past six clock has just struck $m_bertuccio$ said the #count# severely five #minute# afterwards the #door# of the #drawing# #room# were thrown open and $m_bertuccio$ appearing said with a violent #effort#
the #dinner# waits the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ offered his #arm# to #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ de $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ he said #will# you conduct the #baroness# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ complied and they passed on to the dining #room# #chapter# the #dinner# it was evident that #one# sentiment affected all the #guest# on entering the dining #room#
each #one# asked what strange influence had brought them to this $house_of_peers$ and yet astonished even uneasy though they were they still felt that they would not like to be absent
the recent #event# the solitary and eccentric #position# of the #count# his enormous nay almost incredible #fortune# should have made #man# cautious and have altogether prevented #lady# visiting a $house_of_peers$ where there was no #one# of their own sex to receive them and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to overleap the bounds of prudence and decorum
and all present even including $monsieur_cavalcanti$ and his #son# notwithstanding the stiffness of the #one# and the carelessness of the #other# were thoughtful on finding themselves assembled at the $house_of_peers$ of this incomprehensible #man#
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had started when $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ on the #count# invitation offered his #arm# and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ felt that his #glance# was uneasy beneath his #gold# spectacles when he felt the #arm# of the #baroness# press upon his own
none of this had escaped the #count# and even by this mere contact of individuals the #scene# had already acquired considerable #interest# for an observer
the #count# was seated between #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ the #other# #seat# were filled by $m_lucien_debray$ who was placed between the two $monsieur_cavalcanti$ and by $baron_de_château_renaud$ seated between #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and $m_maximilian_morrel$
the repast was magnificent $m_de_monte_cristo$ had endeavored completely to overturn the parisian #idea# and to feed the curiosity as much as the appetite of his #guest#
it was an oriental feast that he offered to them but of such a kind as the arabian fairies might be supposed to prepare
every delicious fruit that the four #quarter# of the globe could provide was heaped in vases from china and jars from japan
rare birds retaining their most brilliant plumage enormous fish spread upon massive silver dishes together with every wine produced in the archipelago asia minor or the cape sparkling in bottles whose grotesque shape seemed to give an additional flavor to the draught all these like #one# of the displays with which apicius of old gratified his #guest# passed in review before the #eye# of the astonished parisians who understood that it was possible to expend a thousand $louis_xviii$ upon a #dinner# for ten #person# but only on the condition of eating pearls like cleopatra or drinking refined #gold# like lorenzo de medici
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had on the #right# #hand# #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ on his left $m_maximilian_morrel$ $m_de_monte_cristo$ noticed the general #astonishment# and began laughing and joking about it
#gentleman# he said you #will# admit that when arrived at a certain degree of #fortune# the superfluities of #life# are all that can be desired and the #lady# #will# allow that after having risen to a certain eminence of #position# the ideal alone can be more exalted
now to follow out this reasoning what is the marvellous that which we do not understand what is it that we really #desire# that which we cannot obtain
now to see #thing# which i cannot understand to procure impossibilities these are the #study# of my #life# i gratify my #wish# by two #mean#
i take as much #interest# in the pursuit of some whim as you do $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ in promoting a new railway #line# you $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in condemning a culprit to #death# you $m_lucien_debray$ in pacifying a kingdom you de $baron_de_château_renaud$ in pleasing a #woman# and you $m_maximilian_morrel$ in breaking a #horse# that no #one# can ride
my #will# and my #money# for example you see these two fish #one# brought from fifty leagues beyond st petersburg the #other# five leagues from naples
$baron_de_château_renaud$ who has lived in russia #will# tell you the #name# of #one# and major $monsieur_cavalcanti$ who is an italian #will# tell you the #name# of the #other#
is it not amusing to see them both on the same #table# what are the two fish asked $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
this #one# is i think a sterlet said $baron_de_château_renaud$ and that #one# if i mistake not a lamprey
just so now $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ ask these #gentleman# where they are caught sterlets said $baron_de_château_renaud$ are only found in the volga
and said $monsieur_cavalcanti$ i know that lake fusaro alone supplies lampreys of that size exactly #one# comes from the volga and the #other# from lake fusaro
impossible cried all the #guest# simultaneously well this is just what amuses me said $m_de_monte_cristo$
this fish which seems so exquisite to you is very likely no better than perch or salmon but it seemed impossible to procure it and here it is
i am like nero cupitor impossibilium and that is what is amusing you at this #moment# but how could you have these fish brought to france
#one# filled with river herbs and weeds the #other# with rushes and lake plants they were placed in a wagon built on #purpose# and thus the sterlet lived twelve #day# the lamprey eight and both were alive when my cook seized them killing #one# with milk and the #other# with wine
oh #nothing# more easy each fish was brought over in a cask you do not believe me $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
$monsieur_baptistin$ said the #count# have the #other# fish brought in the sterlet and the lamprey which came in the #other# casks and which are yet alive
i cannot help doubting answered $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with his stupid #smile# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ opened his bewildered #eye# the company clapped their #hand#
four #servant# carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants and in each of which was breathing a fish similar to those on the #table#
but why have two of each #sort# asked $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ merely because #one# might have died carelessly answered $m_de_monte_cristo$
you are certainly an extraordinary #man# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and philosophers may well say it is a fine #thing# to be rich
oh do not give me credit for this #madame# it was done by the romans who much esteemed them and pliny relates that they sent slaves from ostia to rome who carried on their #head# fish which he calls the mulus and which from the description must probably be the goldfish
it was also considered a luxury to have them alive it being an amusing #sight# to see them die for when dying they change color three or four #time# and like the rainbow when it disappears pass through all the prismatic shades after which they were sent to the kitchen
and to have #idea# added #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ their agony formed #part# of their merit if they were not seen alive they were despised when dead
yes said $m_lucien_debray$ but then ostia is only a few leagues from rome true said $m_de_monte_cristo$
but what would be the #use# of living eighteen hundred #year# after lucullus if we can do no better than he could
the two $monsieur_cavalcanti$ opened their enormous #eye# but had the good sense not to say #anything# all this is very extraordinary said $baron_de_château_renaud$
still what i admire the most i confess is the marvellous promptitude with which your #order# are executed is it not true that you only bought this $house_of_peers$ five or six #day# ago
if i remember rightly it had another entrance and the courtyard was paved and empty while #today# we have a splendid lawn bordered by #tree# which appear to be a hundred #year# old
certainly not longer well i am sure it is quite transformed since last week why not
the #door# was towards the #road# before and on the #day# of my miraculous escape you brought me into the $house_of_peers$ from the #road# i remember
i am fond of grass and shade said $m_de_monte_cristo$ yes said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ yes #madame# said $m_de_monte_cristo$
but i preferred having an entrance which would allow me to see the bois de boulogne over my #gate#
indeed said $baron_de_château_renaud$ it seems quite miraculous to make a new $house_of_peers$ out of an old #one# for it was very old and dull too
i recollect coming for my #mother# to #look# at it when de $madame_de_saint_méran$ advertised it for sale two or three #year# ago
in four #day# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ it is extraordinary de $madame_de_saint_méran$ said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ then this $house_of_peers$ belonged to de $madame_de_saint_méran$ before you bought it
it appears so replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it
quite so my steward transacts all this #business# for me it is certainly ten #year# since the $house_of_peers$ had been occupied said $baron_de_château_renaud$
and it was quite melancholy to #look# at it with the blinds closed the #door# locked and the weeds in the #court#
really if the $house_of_peers$ had not belonged to the #father# in #law# of the #procureur# #one# might have #thought# it some accursed #place# where a horrible #crime# had been committed
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who had hitherto not tasted the three or four #glass# of rare wine which were placed before him here took #one# and drank it off
$m_de_monte_cristo$ allowed a short #time# to elapse and then said it is singular #baron# but the same #idea# came across me the first #time# i came here
it looked so gloomy i should never have bought it if my steward had not taken the #matter# into his own #hand#
perhaps the #fellow# had been bribed by the #notary# it is probable stammered out $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ trying to #smile#
this $house_of_peers$ is #part# of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #marriage# portion and de $madame_de_saint_méran$ wished to sell it for if it had remained another #year# or two uninhabited it would have fallen to ruin
but i can assure you that i had #nothing# to do with any such proceeding it was $m_maximilian_morrel$ #turn# to become pale
there was above all #one# #room# continued $m_de_monte_cristo$ very plain in #appearance# hung with red damask which i know not why appeared to me quite dramatic
why so said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ why dramatic can we #account# for instinct said $m_de_monte_cristo$ are there not some #place# where we seem to breathe sadness why we cannot tell
it is a chain of recollections an #idea# which carries you back to #other# #time# to #other# #place# which very likely have no connection with the present #time# and #place#
and there is #something# in this #room# which reminds me forcibly of the #chamber# of the marquise de ganges or desdemona
stay since we have finished #dinner# i #will# show it to you and then we #will# take coffee in the #garden#
after #dinner# the play $m_de_monte_cristo$ looked inquiringly at his #guest# #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ rose $m_de_monte_cristo$ did the same and the #rest# followed their example
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ remained for a #moment# as if rooted to their #seat# they questioned each #other# with vague and stupid #glance#
the #other# attracted by curiosity were already scattered in different #part# of the $house_of_peers$ for they #thought# the #visit# would not be limited to the #one# #room# and that at the same #time# they would obtain a view of the #rest# of the building of which $m_de_monte_cristo$ had created a palace
did you hear said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ we must go replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ offering his #arm# each #one# went out by the open #door#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ waited for the two who remained then when they had passed he brought up the rear and on his #face# was a #smile# which if they could have understood it would have alarmed them much more than a #visit# to the #room# they were about to enter
they began by walking through the #apartment# many of which were fitted up in the eastern style with cushions and divans instead of #bed# and pipes instead of furniture
the #drawing# #room# were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old #master# the boudoirs hung with draperies from china of fanciful colors fantastic design and wonderful texture
there was #nothing# particular about it excepting that although daylight had disappeared it was not lighted and #everything# in it was old fashioned while the #rest# of the #room# had been redecorated
at #length# they arrived at the famous #room# these two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect oh
cried #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ it is really frightful #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ tried to utter a few #word# but was not heard
many observations were made the import of which was a unanimous #opinion# that there was #something# sinister about the #room# m
is it not so asked $m_de_monte_cristo$ #look# at that large clumsy #bed# hung with such gloomy #blood# colored drapery
and those two crayon portraits that have faded from the dampness do they not seem to say with their pale #lip# and staring #eye#
oh said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ smiling are you courageous enough to sit down upon the very #seat# perhaps upon which the #crime# was committed
we have seen $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ became livid #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ fell into a long #seat# placed near the chimney #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ rose suddenly
and then said $m_de_monte_cristo$ this is not all what is there more said $m_lucien_debray$ who had not failed to notice the agitation of #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
ah what else is there said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ for at present i cannot say that i have seen #anything# extraordinary what do you say $monsieur_cavalcanti$
ah said he we have at pisa ugolino tower at ferrara tasso #prison# at rimini the #room# of francesca and paolo
yes but you have not this little #staircase# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ #opening# a #door# concealed by the drapery
#look# at it and tell me what you think of it what a wicked looking crooked #staircase# said $baron_de_château_renaud$ with a #smile#
i do not know whether the wine of chios produces melancholy but certainly #everything# appears to me black in this $house_of_peers$ said $m_lucien_debray$
can you imagine said $m_de_monte_cristo$ some othello or #abbé# de ganges #one# stormy dark #night# descending these stairs #step# by #step# carrying a load which he #wish# to hide from the #sight# of #man# if not from god
ever since $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ dowry had been mentioned $m_maximilian_morrel$ had been silent and sad #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #half# fainted on the #arm# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who was obliged to support himself against the #wall#
it is very evident what is the #matter# with her said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ de $m_de_monte_cristo$ is relating horrible #story# to us doubtless intending to frighten us to #death#
ah #madame# cried $m_lucien_debray$ what is the #matter# with you how pale you #look# yes said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ really #count# you frighten the #lady#
what is the #matter# asked $m_lucien_debray$ in a whisper of #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #nothing# she replied with a violent #effort#
i want #air# that is all #will# you come into the #garden# said $m_lucien_debray$ advancing towards the back #staircase#
no no she answered i would rather remain here are you really frightened #madame# said $m_de_monte_cristo$
oh no #sir# said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ but you suppose #scene# in a #manner# which gives them the #appearance# of reality
ah yes said $m_de_monte_cristo$ smiling it is all a #matter# of imagination why should we not imagine this the #apartment# of an honest #mother#
and that mysterious #staircase# the passage through which not to disturb their sleep the #doctor# and nurse pass or even the #father# carrying the sleeping #child# here #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ instead of being calmed by the soft picture uttered a groan and fainted
and this #bed# with red hangings a #bed# visited by the goddess lucina #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is ill said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ it would be better to take her to her #carriage#
i have mine said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and she passed over to $m_de_monte_cristo$ a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good properties the #count# had tested on $edward$
oh mon dieu said $m_de_monte_cristo$ and i have forgotten my smelling bottle ah said $m_de_monte_cristo$ taking it from her #hand#
yes she said at your advice i have made the trial and have you succeeded i think so
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was carried into the adjoining #room# $m_de_monte_cristo$ dropped a very small portion of the red liquid upon her #lip# she returned to consciousness
ah she cried what a frightful #dream# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ pressed her #hand# to let her know it was not a #dream#
they looked for $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ but as he was not especially interested in poetical #idea# he had gone into the #garden# and was talking with major $monsieur_cavalcanti$ on the projected railway from leghorn to florence
he took the #arm# of #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and conducted her into the #garden# where they found $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ taking coffee between the $monsieur_cavalcanti$
$m_de_monte_cristo$ seemed in #despair# really #madame# he said did i alarm you much oh no #sir# she answered
but you know #thing# impress us differently according to the mood of our #mind# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ forced a laugh
you may believe me if you like but it is my #opinion# that a #crime# has been committed in this $house_of_peers$
and then you know he said an #idea# a supposition is sufficient well said $m_de_monte_cristo$
take #care# said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the #king# attorney is here ah replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ since that is the #case# i #will# take advantage of his #presence# to make my declaration
your declaration said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ yes before witnesses oh this is very interesting said $m_lucien_debray$ if there really has been a #crime# we #will# investigate it
there has been a #crime# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ come this #way# #gentleman# come $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ for a declaration to be available should be made before the competent authorities
he then took $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #arm# and at the same #time# holding that of #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ under his own he dragged the #procureur# to the plantain #tree# where the shade was thickest
all the #other# #guest# followed stay said $m_de_monte_cristo$ here in this very #spot# and he stamped upon the #ground#
i had the #earth# dug up and fresh mould put in to refresh these old #tree# well my #man# digging found a #box# or rather the #iron# #work# of a #box# in the midst of which was the skeleton of a newly born infant
$m_de_monte_cristo$ felt the #arm# of #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ stiffen while that of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ trembled a newly born infant repeated $m_lucien_debray$ this #affair# becomes serious
i was not wrong just now then when i said that #house# had souls and #face# like #man# and that their exteriors carried the impress of their characters
well said $baron_de_château_renaud$ this $house_of_peers$ was gloomy because it was remorseful it was remorseful because it concealed a #crime#
who said it was a #crime# asked $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with a last #effort# how is it not a #crime# to bury a living #child# in a #garden#
cried $m_de_monte_cristo$ and pray what do you call such an action but who said it was buried alive
why bury it there if it were dead this #garden# has never been a cemetery what is done to infanticides in this #country#
asked major $monsieur_cavalcanti$ innocently oh their #head# are soon cut off said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ ah indeed said $monsieur_cavalcanti$
i think so am i not #right# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ asked $m_de_monte_cristo$ yes #count# replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in a #voice# now scarcely human
$m_de_monte_cristo$ seeing that the two #person# for whom he had prepared this #scene# could scarcely endure it and not wishing to carry it too far said
come #gentleman# some coffee we seem to have forgotten it and he conducted the #guest# back to the #table# on the lawn
i am ashamed to own it but all your frightful #story# have so upset me that i must beg you to let me sit down and she fell into a #chair#
indeed #count# said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_de_monte_cristo$ bowed and went to #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i think #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ again requires your bottle he said
but before #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ could reach her #friend# the #procureur# had found #time# to whisper to #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i must speak to you
when #tomorrow# where in my office or in the #court# if you like that is the surest #place#
i #will# be there at this #moment# #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ approached #thank# my dear #friend# said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ trying to #smile#
the #evening# passed on #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ expressed a #desire# to #return# to paris which #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had not dared to do notwithstanding the uneasiness she experienced
it is over now and i am much better #chapter# the beggar on his #wife# request $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was the first to give the signal of departure
as for $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ absorbed in an interesting #conversation# with $monsieur_cavalcanti$ he paid no #attention# to #anything# that was passing
while $m_de_monte_cristo$ had begged the smelling bottle of #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ he had noticed the approach of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ to #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and he soon guessed all that had passed between them though the #word# had been uttered in so low a #voice# as hardly to be heard by #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
without opposing their arrangements he allowed $m_maximilian_morrel$ $baron_de_château_renaud$ and $m_lucien_debray$ to leave on horseback and the #lady# in $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #carriage#
he offered a #seat# in his landau to #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ that she might be under the #care# of his #wife# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ more and more delighted with major $monsieur_cavalcanti$ had offered him a #seat# in his #carriage#
$andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ found his tilbury waiting at the #door# the groom in every respect a caricature of the english fashion was standing on tiptoe to hold a large #iron# gray #horse#
$andrea_rondolo$ had spoken very little during #dinner# he was an intelligent lad and he feared to utter some absurdity before so many grand #people# amongst whom with dilating #eye# he saw the #king# attorney
then he had been seized upon by $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who with a rapid #glance# at the stiff necked old major and his modest #son# and taking into consideration the hospitality of the #count# made up his #mind# that he was in the society of some nabob come to paris to finish the worldly education of his heir
he contemplated with unspeakable delight the large #diamond# which shone on the major little #finger# for the major like a prudent #man# in #case# of any accident happening to his bank #note# had immediately converted them into an available asset
then after #dinner# on the pretext of #business# he questioned the #father# and #son# upon their mode of living and the #father# and #son# previously informed that it was through $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ the #one# was to receive his #franc# and the #other# livres annually were so full of affability that they would have shaken #hand# even with the #banker# #servant# so much did their gratitude need an object to expend itself upon
the latter faithful to the principle of horace nil admirari had contented himself with showing his knowledge by declaring in what lake the best lampreys were caught
then he had eaten some without saying a #word# more $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ therefore concluded that such luxuries were common at the #table# of the illustrious descendant of the $monsieur_cavalcanti$ who most likely in lucca fed upon trout brought from switzerland and
lobsters sent from england by the same #mean# used by the #count# to bring the lampreys from lake fusaro and the sterlet from the volga
#one# #thing# above all the #rest# heightened the respect nay almost the veneration of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ for $monsieur_cavalcanti$ thus it was with much politeness of #manner# that he heard $monsieur_cavalcanti$ pronounce these #word#
#tomorrow# #sir# i shall have the #honor# of waiting upon you on #business# and i #sir# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ shall be most happy to receive you
upon which he offered to take $monsieur_cavalcanti$ in his #carriage# to the hôtel des princes if it would not be depriving him of the company of his #son#
to this $monsieur_cavalcanti$ replied by saying that for some #time# past his #son# had lived independently of him that he had his own #horse# and #carriage# and that not having come together it would not be difficult for them to leave separately
the major seated himself therefore by the #side# of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who was more and more charmed with the #idea# of #order# and economy which ruled this #man# and yet who being able to allow his #son# #franc# a #year# might be supposed to possess a #fortune# of or livres
as for $andrea_rondolo$ he began by #way# of showing off to scold his groom who instead of bringing the tilbury to the #step# of the $house_of_peers$ had taken it to the outer #door# thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty #step# to reach it
the groom heard him with humility took the bit of the impatient animal with his left #hand# and with the #right# held out the reins to $andrea_rondolo$ who taking them from him rested his polished boot lightly on the #step#
the young #man# turned round thinking that $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ or $m_de_monte_cristo$ had forgotten #something# they wished to tell him and had returned just as they were starting
but instead of either of these he saw #nothing# but a strange #face# sunburnt and encircled by a beard with #eye# brilliant as carbuncles and a #smile# upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth pointed and sharp as the wolf or jackal
a red handkerchief encircled his gray #head# torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs which seemed as though like those of a skeleton they would rattle as he walked and the #hand# with which he leaned upon the young #man# #shoulder# and which was the first #thing# $andrea_rondolo$ saw seemed of gigantic size
did the young #man# recognize that #face# by the #light# of the lantern in his tilbury or was he merely struck with the horrible #appearance# of his interrogator
at that #moment# a #hand# touched his #shoulder# we cannot say but only relate the #fact# that he shuddered and stepped back suddenly
what do you want of me he asked pardon me my #friend# if i disturb you said the #man# with the red handkerchief
but i want to speak to you you have no #right# to beg at #night# said the groom endeavoring to rid his #master# of the troublesome intruder
i am not begging my fine #fellow# said the unknown to the #servant# with so ironical an #expression# of the #eye# and so frightful a #smile# that he withdrew i only #wish# to say two or three #word# to your #master# who gave me a commission to execute about a fortnight ago
come said $andrea_rondolo$ with sufficient nerve for his #servant# not to perceive his agitation what do you want
speak quickly #friend# the #man# said in a low #voice# i #wish# i #wish# you to spare me the walk back to paris
i am very tired and as i have not eaten so good a #dinner# as you i can scarcely stand
the young #man# shuddered at this strange familiarity tell me he said tell me what you want well then i want you to take me up in your fine #carriage# and carry me back
$andrea_rondolo$ turned pale but said #nothing# yes said the #man# thrusting his #hand# into his #pocket# and looking impudently at the youth
i have taken the whim into my #head# do you understand #master# $m_benedetto$ at this #name# no #doubt# the young #man# reflected a little for he went towards his groom saying
this #man# is #right# i did indeed charge him with a commission the result of which he must tell me walk to the barrier there take a cab that you may not be too late
oh as for that i ll take you to a splendid #place# said the #man# with the handkerchief and taking the #horse# bit he led the tilbury where it was certainly impossible for #anyone# to witness the #honor# that $andrea_rondolo$ conferred upon him
the surprised groom retired let me at least reach a shady #spot# said $andrea_rondolo$ dont think i want the glory of riding in your fine #carriage# said he
oh no it only because i am tired and also because i have a little #business# to talk over with you
it was a #pity# this #scene# had not occurred in daylight for it was curious to see this rascal throwing himself heavily down on the cushion beside the young and elegant driver of the tilbury
$andrea_rondolo$ drove past the last $house_of_peers$ in the village without saying a #word# to his #companion# who smiled complacently as though well pleased to find himself travelling in so comfortable a vehicle
once out of $auteuil$ $andrea_rondolo$ looked around in #order# to assure himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and then stopping the #horse# and crossing his #arm# before the #man# he asked
come #step# in said the young #man# now tell me why you come to disturb my tranquillity let me ask you why you deceived me
when we parted at the pont du var you told me you were going to travel through piedmont and tuscany but instead of that you come to paris
how have i deceived you how do you ask how does that annoy you it does not on the #contrary# i think it #will# #answer# my #purpose#
so said $andrea_rondolo$ you are speculating upon me what fine #word# he uses i warn you #master# $m_caderousse$ that you are mistaken
well well dont be angry my #boy# you know well enough what it is to be unfortunate and #misfortune# make us jealous
i #thought# you were earning a living in tuscany or piedmont by acting as facchino or cicerone and i pitied you sincerely as i would a #child# of my own
you know i always did call you my #child# come come what then patience patience i am patient but go on
all at once i see you pass through the barrier with a groom a tilbury and fine new clothes
you must have discovered a mine or else become a stockbroker so that as you confess you are jealous
no i am pleased so pleased that i wished to congratulate you but as i am not quite properly dressed i chose my opportunity that i might not compromise you
yes and a fine opportunity you have chosen exclaimed $andrea_rondolo$ you speak to me before my #servant#
you have a quick #horse# a #light# tilbury you are naturally as slippery as an eel if i had missed you tonight i might not have had another #chance#
how can i help that my #boy# i speak to you when i can catch you you see i do not conceal myself
you are lucky i #wish# i could say as much for i do conceal myself and then i was afraid you would not recognize me but you did added $m_caderousse$ with his unpleasant #smile#
it was very polite of you come said $andrea_rondolo$ what do you want you do not speak affectionately to me $m_benedetto$ my old #friend# that is not #right#
take #care# or i may become troublesome this menace smothered the young #man# passion he urged the #horse# again into a trot
you should not speak so to an old #friend# like me $m_caderousse$ as you said just now you are a native of marseilles i am
do you know then now what you are no but i was brought up in corsica you are old and obstinate i am young and wilful
between #people# like us threats are out of #place# #everything# should be amicably arranged is it my fault if #fortune# which has frowned on you has been kind to me
#fortune# has been kind to you then your tilbury your groom your clothes are not then hired good so much the better said $m_caderousse$ his #eye# sparkling with avarice
if i had been wearing a handkerchief like yours on my #head# rags on my back and worn out shoes on my #foot# you would not have known me
oh you knew that well enough before speaking to me said $andrea_rondolo$ becoming more and more excited
now i have found you #nothing# prevents my being as well dressed as #anyone# knowing as i do the goodness of your #heart#
you wrong me my #boy# if you have two coats you #will# give me #one# of them i used to divide my soup and beans with you when you were hungry
true said $andrea_rondolo$ what an appetite you used to have is it as good now oh yes replied $andrea_rondolo$ laughing
how did you come to be dining with that prince whose $house_of_peers$ you have just left he is not a prince simply a #count#
a #count# and a rich #one# too eh yes but you had better not have #anything# to say to him for he is not a very good tempered #gentleman#
oh be easy i have no design upon your #count# and you shall have him all to yourself but said $m_caderousse$ again smiling with the disagreeable #expression# he had before assumed you must pay for it
you understand well what do you want i think that with a hundred #franc# a #month#
well i could live upon a hundred #franc# come you understand me but that with with
with a hundred and fifty #franc# i should be quite happy here are two hundred said $andrea_rondolo$ and he placed ten #gold# $louis_xviii$ in the #hand# of $m_caderousse$
good said $m_caderousse$ apply to the steward on the first #day# of every #month# and you #will# receive the same #sum#
there now again you degrade me how so by making me apply to the #servant# when i want to transact #business# with you alone
well be it so then take it from me then and so long at least as i receive my income you shall be paid yours
i always said you were a fine #fellow# and it is a blessing when good #fortune# happens to such as you
come come but tell me all about it why do you #wish# to know asked $monsieur_cavalcanti$ what
do you again defy me no the #fact# is i have found my #father# what a real #father#
yes so long as he pays me you ll #honor# and believe him that #right# what is his #name#
major $monsieur_cavalcanti$ is he pleased with you so far i have appeared to #answer# his #purpose#
and who found this #father# for you the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ the #man# whose $house_of_peers$ you have just left
yes i #wish# you would try and find me a situation with him as #grandfather# since he holds the #money# chest
well i #will# mention you to him meanwhile what are you going to do i yes you
it is very kind of you to trouble yourself about me since you #interest# yourself in my #affair# i think it is now my #turn# to ask you some #question#
well i shall rent a #room# in some respectable $house_of_peers$ wear a decent coat shave every #day# and go and read the #paper# in a café
ah true then in the #evening# i shall go to the theatre i shall #look# like some retired baker
that is what i want come if you #will# only put this scheme into execution and be steady #nothing# could be better
do you think so bossuet and you what #will# you become a peer of france ah said $andrea_rondolo$ who knows
and now that you have all you want and that we understand each #other# jump down from the tilbury and disappear
major $monsieur_cavalcanti$ is already #one# perhaps but then hereditary rank is abolished no politics $m_caderousse$
why just think for a #moment# with this red handkerchief on my #head# with scarcely any shoes no #paper# and ten #gold# napoleons in my #pocket# without reckoning what was there before making in all about two hundred #franc# why i should certainly be arrested at the barriers
then to justify myself i should say that you gave me the #money# this would cause inquiries it would be found that i left toulon without giving due notice and i should then be escorted back to the shores of the mediterranean
not at all my good #friend# how not at all then i should become simply no and good bye to my #dream# of resembling the retired baker
no no my #boy# i prefer remaining honorably in the capital $andrea_rondolo$ scowled certainly as he had himself owned the reputed #son# of major $monsieur_cavalcanti$ was a wilful #fellow#
he drew up for a #minute# threw a rapid #glance# around him and then his #hand# fell instantly into his #pocket# where it began playing with a #pistol#
but meanwhile $m_caderousse$ who had never taken his #eye# off his #companion# passed his #hand# behind his back and opened a long spanish knife which he always carried with him to be ready in #case# of need
$andrea_rondolo$ #hand# left his #pocket# inoffensively and was carried up to the red moustache which it played with for some #time#
the two #friend# as we see were worthy of and understood #one# another good $m_caderousse$ he said how happy you #will# be
i #will# do my best said the innkeeper of the pont du gard shutting up his knife well then we #will# go into paris
but how #will# you pass through the barrier without exciting suspicion it seems to me that you are in more danger riding than on #foot#
he then took the greatcoat with the large collar which the groom had left behind in the tilbury and put it on his back then he took off $monsieur_cavalcanti$ hat which he placed upon his own #head# and finally he assumed the careless attitude of a #servant# whose #master# drives himself
wait said $m_caderousse$ we shall see but tell me said $andrea_rondolo$ am i to remain bareheaded
pooh said $m_caderousse$ it is so windy that your hat can easily appear to have blown off come come enough of this said $monsieur_cavalcanti$
what are you waiting for said $m_caderousse$ i #hope# i am not the cause hush said $andrea_rondolo$ they passed the barrier without accident
at the first cross #street# $andrea_rondolo$ stopped his #horse# and $m_caderousse$ leaped out well said $andrea_rondolo$ my #servant# coat and my hat
ah said $m_caderousse$ you would not like me to risk taking cold but what am i to do
you oh you are young while i am beginning to get old au revoir $m_benedetto$ and running into a #court# he disappeared
alas said $andrea_rondolo$ sighing #one# cannot be completely happy in this #world# #chapter# a conjugal #scene# at the #place# $louis_xviii$ xv
the three young #people# separated that is to say $m_maximilian_morrel$ went to the boulevards $baron_de_château_renaud$ to the pont de la révolution and $m_lucien_debray$ to the quai
most probably $m_maximilian_morrel$ and $baron_de_château_renaud$ returned to their domestic hearths as they say in the gallery of the #chamber# in well turned speeches and in the theatre of the rue richelieu in well written #piece# but it was not the #case# with $m_lucien_debray$
when he reached the wicket of the louvre he turned to the left galloped across the carrousel passed through the rue saint roch and issuing from the rue de la michodière he arrived at $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #door# just at the same #time# that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ landau after having deposited him and his #wife# at the $faubourg_saint_honoré$ stopped to leave the #baroness# at her own $house_of_peers$
$m_lucien_debray$ with the #air# of a #man# familiar with the $house_of_peers$ entered first into the #court# threw his bridle into the #hand# of a footman and returned to the #door# to receive #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to whom he offered his #arm# to conduct her to her #apartment#
the #gate# once closed and $m_lucien_debray$ and the #baroness# alone in the #court# he asked what was the #matter# with you $hermine$
and why were you so affected at that #story# or rather fable which the #count# related because i have been in such shocking spirits all the #evening# my #friend# said the #baroness#
no $hermine$ replied $m_lucien_debray$ you cannot make me believe that on the #contrary# you were in excellent spirits when you arrived at the #count#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was disagreeable certainly but i know how much you #care# for his ill humor someone has vexed you i #will# allow no #one# to annoy you
you are deceived $m_lucien_debray$ i assure you replied #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and what i have told you is really the #case# added to the ill humor you remarked but which
it was evident that #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was suffering from that nervous irritability which #woman# frequently cannot #account# for even to themselves or that as $m_lucien_debray$ had guessed she had experienced some #secret# agitation that she would not acknowledge to #anyone#
being a #man# who knew that the former of these symptoms was #one# of the inherent penalties of womanhood he did not then press his inquiries but waited for a more appropriate opportunity when he should again interrogate her or receive an avowal proprio motu
i did not think it worth while to allude to at the #door# of her #apartment# the #baroness# met $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ cornélie her confidential maid
what is my #daughter# doing asked #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ she practiced all the #evening# and then went to #bed# replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ cornélie
yet i think i hear her piano it is $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ armilly who is playing while $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is in #bed#
well said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ come and undress me they entered the bedroom $m_lucien_debray$ stretched himself upon a large couch and #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ passed into her dressing #room# with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ cornélie
my dear $m_lucien_debray$ said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ through the #door# you are always complaining that $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #will# not address a #word# to you
#madame# said $m_lucien_debray$ playing with a little dog who recognizing him as a #friend# of the $house_of_peers$ expected to be caressed
i am not the only #one# who makes similar complaints i think i heard $m_albert_de_morcerf$ say that he could not extract a #word# from his betrothed
true said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ yet i think this #will# all pass off and that you #will# #one# #day# see her enter your #study#
my #study# at least that of the #minister# why so to ask for an engagement at the opera
really i never saw such an infatuation for music it is quite ridiculous for a young #lady# of fashion $m_lucien_debray$ smiled
well said he let her come with your consent and that of the #baron# and we #will# try and give her an engagement though we are very poor to pay such talent as hers
cornélie obeyed and the next #minute# #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ left her #room# in a charming loose dress and came and sat down close to $m_lucien_debray$
go cornélie said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i do not require you any longer then she began thoughtfully to caress the little spaniel
$m_lucien_debray$ looked at her for a #moment# in #silence# come $hermine$ he said after a short #time# #answer# candidly #something# vexes
you is it not so #nothing# answered the #baroness# and yet as she could scarcely breathe she rose and went towards a looking #glass#
i am frightful tonight she said $m_lucien_debray$ rose smiling and was about to contradict the #baroness# upon this latter #point# when the #door# opened suddenly
m $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ appeared $m_lucien_debray$ reseated himself at the #noise# of the #door# #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ turned round and looked upon her #husband# with an #astonishment# she took no trouble to conceal
probably the #baroness# #thought# this unexpected #visit# signified a #desire# to make up for the sharp #word# he had uttered during the #day#
good #evening# #madame# said the #banker# good #evening# $m_lucien_debray$ assuming a dignified #air# she turned round to $m_lucien_debray$ without answering her #husband#
$m_lucien_debray$ who was slightly disturbed at this #visit# recovered himself when he saw the calmness of the #baroness# and took up a book marked by a #mother# of pearl knife inlaid with #gold#
read me #something# $m_lucien_debray$ she said excuse me said the #banker# but you #will# tire yourself #baroness# by such late #hour# and $m_lucien_debray$ #life# some #distance# from here
because it was apparent that beneath outward politeness there really lurked a determined spirit of opposition to #anything# his #wife# might #wish# to do
the #baroness# was also surprised and showed her #astonishment# by a #look# which would doubtless have had some #effect# upon her #husband# if he had not been intently occupied with the #paper# where he was looking to see the closing stock quotations
$m_lucien_debray$ was petrified not only to hear $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ speak so calmly and politely but the result was that the proud #look# entirely failed of its #purpose#
i assure you i have no #desire# to sleep and that i have a thousand #thing# to tell you this #evening# which you must listen to even though you slept while hearing me
my dear $m_lucien_debray$ said the #banker# do not kill yourself tonight listening to the follies of #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ for you can hear them as well #tomorrow# but i claim tonight and #will# devote it if you #will# allow me to talk over some serious #matter# with my #wife#
this #time# the blow was so well aimed and hit so directly that $m_lucien_debray$ and the #baroness# were staggered and they interrogated each #other# with their #eye# as if to seek help against this aggression but the irresistible #will# of the #master# of the $house_of_peers$ prevailed and the #husband# was victorious
$m_lucien_debray$ said the #baroness# i am at your #service# #madame# replied $m_lucien_debray$ coldly do not think i #wish# to #turn# you out my dear $m_lucien_debray$ continued $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
oh no not at all an unexpected occurrence forces me to ask my #wife# to have a little #conversation# with me it is
so rarely i make such a request i am sure you cannot grudge it to me $m_lucien_debray$ muttered #something# bowed and went out knocking himself against the edge of the #door# like nathan in athalie
it is extraordinary he said when the #door# was closed behind him how easily these #husband# whom we ridicule gain an advantage over us
$m_lucien_debray$ having left $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ took his #place# on the sofa closed the open book and placing himself in a dreadfully dictatorial attitude he began playing with the dog but the animal not liking him as well as $m_lucien_debray$ and attempting to bite him $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ seized him by the skin of his neck and threw him upon a couch on the #other# #side# of the #room#
the animal uttered a #cry# during the transit but arrived at its destination it crouched behind the cushions and stupefied at such unusual treatment remained silent and motionless
do you know #sir# asked the #baroness# that you are improving generally you are only rude but tonight you are brutal
it is because i am in a worse humor than usual replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $hermine$ looked at the #banker# with supreme disdain
and what have i to do with your ill humor said the #baroness# irritated at the impassibility of her #husband# do these #thing# concern me
keep your ill humor at home in your #money# #box# or since you have clerks whom you pay vent it upon them
these #glance# frequently exasperated the pride of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ but this #evening# he took no notice of them not so replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
my #money# #box# are my pactolus as i think demoustier says and i #will# not retard its #course# or disturb its calm
my clerks are honest #man# who earn my #fortune# whom i pay much below their deserts if i may value them according to what they bring in therefore i shall not get into a passion with them those with whom i #will# be in a passion are those who eat my #dinner# mount my #horse# and exhaust my #fortune#
your advice is wrong so i shall not follow it and pray who are the #person# who exhaust your #fortune#
explain yourself more clearly i beg #sir# oh make yourself easy i am not speaking riddles and you #will# soon know what i #mean#
the #people# who exhaust my #fortune# are those who draw out #franc# in the #course# of an #hour#
i do not understand you #sir# said the #baroness# trying to disguise the agitation of her #voice# and the flush of her #face#
you understand me perfectly on the #contrary# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ but if you #will# persist i #will# tell you that i have just lost #franc# upon the spanish loan
and pray asked the #baroness# am i responsible for this loss why not is it my fault you have lost #franc#
i tell you i #will# not hear cash named it is a style of language i never heard in the $house_of_peers$ of my parents or in that of my first #husband#
certainly it is not mine once for all #sir# replied the #baroness# sharply oh i can well believe that for neither of them was worth a penny
the better #reason# for my not being conversant with the slang of the bank which is here dinning in my ears from #morning# to #night# that #noise# of jingling crowns which are constantly being counted and re counted is odious to me
i only know #one# #thing# i dislike more which is the #sound# of your #voice# really said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
well this surprises me for i #thought# you took the liveliest #interest# in all my #affair# i what could put such an #idea# into your #head#
yourself ah what next most assuredly i should like to know upon what occasion
oh mon dieu that is very easily done last february you were the first who told me of the haitian funds
you had dreamed that a ship had entered the harbor at le havre that this ship brought news that a payment we had looked upon as lost was going to be made
i know how clear sighted your #dream# are i therefore purchased immediately as many shares as i could of the haitian debt and i gained #franc# by it of which have been honestly paid to you
you spent it as you pleased that was your #business# in march there was a #question# about a grant to a railway
you told me that your instinct and although you pretend to know #nothing# about speculations i think on the #contrary# that your comprehension is very clear upon certain #affair# well you told me that your instinct led you to believe the grant would be given to the company called the southern
i bought two thirds of the shares of that company as you had foreseen the shares trebled in value and i picked up a #million# from which #franc# were paid to you for pin #money#
three companies presented themselves each offering equal securities how have you spent this #franc# it is no #business# of mine
when are you coming to the #point# cried the #baroness# shivering with anger and impatience patience #madame# i am coming to it
that fortunate in april you went to dine at the #minister# you heard a private #conversation# respecting spanish #affair# on the expulsion of $don_carlos$
i bought some spanish shares the expulsion took #place# and i pocketed #franc# the #day# charles repassed the bidassoa
they were yours you disposed of them according to your fancy and i asked no #question# but it is not the less true that you have this #year# received livres
of these #franc# you took crowns well #sir# and what then ah yes it was just after this that you spoiled #everything#
well three #day# after that you talked politics with $m_lucien_debray$ and you fancied from his #word# that $don_carlos$ had returned to spain
really your #manner# of speaking it expresses my meaning and that is all i want well i sold my shares the news got out and i no longer sold
i gave them away next #day# i find the news was false and by this false report i have lost #franc#
well since i gave you a fourth of my gains i think you owe me a fourth of my losses the fourth of #franc# is #franc#
well what you say is absurd and i cannot see why $m_lucien_debray$ #name# is mixed up in this #affair#
because if you do not possess the #franc# i reclaim you must have lent them to your #friend# and $m_lucien_debray$ is #one# of your #friend#
oh let us have no gestures no screams no modern drama or you #will# oblige me to tell you that i see $m_lucien_debray$ leave here pocketing the whole of the livres you have handed over to him this #year# while he #smile# to himself saying that he has found what the most skilful players have never discovered that is a roulette where he wins without playing and is no loser when he loses
for shame exclaimed the #baroness# the #baroness# became enraged wretch she cried #will# you dare to tell me you did not know what you now reproach me with
i do not say that i did know it and i do not say that i did not know it
i merely tell you to #look# into my conduct during the last four #year# that we have ceased to be #husband# and #wife# and see whether it has not always been consistent
some #time# after our rupture you wished to #study# music under the celebrated baritone who made such a successful #appearance# at the théâtre italien at the same #time# i felt inclined to learn dancing of the danseuse who acquired such a reputation in london
i said #nothing# for we must have peace in the $house_of_peers$ and #franc# for a #lady# and #gentleman# to be properly instructed in music and dancing are not too much
this cost me on your #account# and mine #franc# well you soon become tired of singing and you take a fancy to #study# diplomacy with the #minister# secretary
you understand it signifies #nothing# to me so long as you pay for your lessons out of your own cash #box#
but #today# i find you are #drawing# on mine and that your apprenticeship may cost me #franc# per #month# stop there #madame# for this cannot last
either the diplomatist must give his lessons gratis and i #will# tolerate him or he must never set his #foot# again in my $house_of_peers$ do
you understand #madame# oh this is too much cried $hermine$ choking you are worse than despicable but continued $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
i find you did not even pause there insults you are #right# let us leave these #fact# alone and #reason# coolly
i have never interfered in your #affair# excepting for your good treat me in the same #way# you say you have #nothing# to do with my cash #box#
besides how do i know that this was not a political trick that the #minister# enraged at seeing me in the opposition and jealous of the popular sympathy i excite has not concerted with $m_lucien_debray$ to ruin me
be it so do as you like with your own but do not fill or empty mine a probable #thing#
who ever heard of such an occurrence as this a false telegraphic despatch it is almost impossible for wrong signals to be made as they were in the last two telegrams
#sir# said the #baroness# humbly are you not aware that the #man# employed there was dismissed that they talked of going to #law# with him that #order# were issued to arrest him and that this #order# would have been put into execution if he had not escaped by flight which proves that he was either mad or guilty
why not it was done on #purpose# for me i am sure of it it was a mistake
yes which made fools laugh which caused the #minister# to have a sleepless #night# which has caused the #minister# secretaries to blacken several sheets of #paper# but which has cost me #franc#
but #sir# said $hermine$ suddenly if all this is as you say caused by $m_lucien_debray$ why instead of going direct to him do you come and tell me of it
why to accuse the #man# do you address the #woman# do i know $m_lucien_debray$ do i #wish# to know him do
i #wish# to know that he gives advice do i #wish# to follow it do i speculate no you do all this not i
still it seems to me that as you profit by it $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ shrugged his #shoulder# foolish creature he exclaimed
but know that if you had even hidden your irregularities from your #husband# who has but the commencement of the art for generally #husband# #will# not see
#woman# fancy they have talent because they have managed two or three intrigues without being the talk of paris
you would then have been but a faint imitation of most of your #friend# among the #woman# of the #world# but it has not been so with me i see and always have seen during the last sixteen #year#
you may perhaps have hidden a #thought# but not a #step# not an action not a fault has escaped me while you flattered yourself upon your address and firmly believed you had deceived me
what has been the result that #thank# to my pretended ignorance there is none of your #friend# from $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ to $m_lucien_debray$ who has not trembled before me
i #desire# with respect to you there is not #one# in #fact# who would have dared to speak of me as i have spoken of them this #day#
i #will# allow you to make me hateful but i #will# prevent your rendering me ridiculous and above all i forbid you to ruin me
the #baroness# had been tolerably composed until the #name# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had been pronounced but then she became pale and rising
as if touched by a spring she stretched out her #hand# as though conjuring an apparition she then took two or three #step# towards her #husband# as though to #tear# the #secret# from him of which he was ignorant or which he withheld from some odious calculation odious as all his calculations were
there is not #one# who has not treated me as the #master# of the $house_of_peers$ the only title $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ what do you #mean#
i #mean# that de nargonne your first #husband# being neither a philosopher nor a #banker# or perhaps being both and seeing there was #nothing# to be got out of a #king# attorney died of #grief# or anger at finding after an absence of nine #month# that you had been enceinte six
i am brutal i not only allow it but boast of it it is #one# of the #reason# of my success in commercial #business#
why did he kill himself instead of you because he had no cash to save my #life# belongs to my cash
$m_lucien_debray$ has made me lose #franc# let him bear his share of the loss and we #will# go on as before if not let him become bankrupt for the livres and do as all bankrupts do disappear
he is a charming #fellow# i allow when his news is correct but when it is not there are fifty #other# in the #world# who would do better than he
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was rooted to the #spot# she made a violent #effort# to reply to this last attack but she fell upon a #chair# thinking of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ of the #dinner# #scene# of the strange series of #misfortune# which had taken #place# in her $house_of_peers$ during the last few #day# and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a #scene# of scandalous debate
he shut the bedroom #door# after him without adding another #word# and returned to his #apartment# and when #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ recovered from her #half# fainting condition she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable #dream#
the #day# following this #scene# at the #hour# $m_lucien_debray$ usually chose to pay a #visit# to #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ on his #way# to his office his coupé did not appear
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ did not even #look# at her though she did her best to faint #chapter# matrimonial projects at this #time# that is about #half# past twelve #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ ordered her #carriage# and went out
he gave #order# that he should be informed as soon as #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ appeared but at two clock she had not returned
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ hidden behind a curtain watched the departure he had been waiting for he then called for his #horse# drove to the #chamber# and inscribed his #name# to speak against the budget
from twelve to two clock $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had remained in his #study# unsealing his dispatches and becoming more and more sad every #minute# heaping figure upon figure and receiving among #other# #visit# #one# from major $monsieur_cavalcanti$ who as stiff and exact as ever presented himself precisely at the #hour# named the #night# before to terminate his #business# with the #banker#
on leaving the #chamber# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who had shown violent marks of agitation during the sitting and been more bitter than ever against the ministry re entered his #carriage# and told the coachman to drive to the avenue des champs élysées no
$m_de_monte_cristo$ was at home only he was engaged with someone and begged $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to wait for a #moment# in the #drawing# #room#
while the #banker# was waiting in the anteroom the #door# opened and a #man# dressed as an #abbé# and doubtless more familiar with the $house_of_peers$ than he was came in and instead of waiting merely bowed passed on to the farther #apartment# and disappeared
a #minute# after the #door# by which the #priest# had entered reopened and $m_de_monte_cristo$ appeared pardon me said he
my dear #baron# but #one# of my #friend# the $abbé_busoni$ whom you perhaps saw pass by has just arrived in paris not having seen him for a long #time# i could not make up my #mind# to leave him sooner so i #hope# this #will# be sufficient #reason# for my having made you wait
nay said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ it is my fault i have chosen my #visit# at a wrong #time# and #will# retire
not at all on the #contrary# be seated but what is the #matter# with you you #look# careworn really you alarm me
melancholy in a capitalist like the #appearance# of a comet presages some #misfortune# to the #world# i have been in ill luck for several #day# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
and i have heard #nothing# but bad news ah indeed said $m_de_monte_cristo$ have you had another fall at the bourse
no i am safe for a few #day# at least i am only annoyed about a bankrupt of trieste
really does it happen to be $jacopo_manfredi$ exactly so imagine a #man# who has transacted #business# with me for
i dont know how long to the amount of or #franc# during the #year# never a mistake or delay a #fellow# who paid like a prince
well i was a #million# in advance with him and now my fine $jacopo_manfredi$ suspends payment really
i draw upon him for #franc# my bills are returned unpaid and more than that i hold bills of exchange signed by him to the value of #franc# payable at his correspondent in paris at the #end# of this #month#
it is an unheard of fatality #today# is the th i present them but my correspondent has disappeared this with my spanish #affair# made a pretty #end# to the #month#
then you really lost by that #affair# in spain yes only #franc# out of my cash #box# #nothing# more
why how could you make such a mistake such an old stager oh it is all my #wife# fault
she dreamed $don_carlos$ had returned to spain she believes in #dream# it is magnetism she says and when she #dream# a #thing# it is sure to happen she assures me
it is true she speculates with her own #money# not mine nevertheless you can understand that when #franc# leave the #wife# #pocket# the #husband# always finds it out
on this conviction i allow her to speculate she having her bank and her stockbroker she speculated and lost but do you #mean# to say you have not heard of this
yes i heard it spoken of but i did not know the details and then no #one# can be more ignorant than i am of the #affair# in the bourse
why the #thing# has made a tremendous #noise# then you do not speculate i how could i speculate when i already have so much trouble in regulating my income
i should be obliged besides my steward to keep a clerk and a #boy# but touching these spanish #affair# i think that the #baroness# did not #dream# the whole of the $don_carlos$ #matter#
the #paper# said #something# about it did they not then you believe the #paper# i not the least in the #world#
only i fancied that the honest messager was an exception to the rule and that it only announced telegraphic despatches
well that what puzzles me replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ the news of the #return# of $don_carlos$ was brought by telegraph
so that said $m_de_monte_cristo$ you have lost nearly #franc# this #month# not nearly indeed that is exactly my loss
diable said $m_de_monte_cristo$ compassionately it is a hard blow for a third rate #fortune# third rate said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ rather humble
what do you #mean# by that certainly continued $m_de_monte_cristo$ i make three assortments in #fortune# first rate second rate and third rate #fortune#
i call those first rate which are composed of #treasure# #one# possesses under #one# #hand# such as mines lands and funded property in such states as france austria and england provided these #treasure# and property form a total of about a hundred #million# i call those second rate #fortune# that are gained by manufacturing enterprises joint stock companies viceroyalties and principalities not #drawing# more than #franc# the whole forming a capital of about fifty #million# finally i call those third rate #fortune# which are composed of a fluctuating capital dependent upon the #will# of #other# or upon #chance# which a bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes such as banks speculations of the #day#
in #fact# all operations under the influence of greater or less mischances the whole bringing in a real or fictitious capital of about fifteen #million#
i think this is about your #position# is it not confound it yes replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ the result then of six more such #month# as this would be to reduce the third rate $house_of_peers$ to #despair#
oh said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ becoming very pale how you are running on let us imagine seven such #month# continued $m_de_monte_cristo$ in the same #tone#
you are #right# for if you indulged in such reflections you would never risk your principal which is to the speculator what the skin is to civilized #man#
we have our clothes some more splendid than #other# this is our credit but when a #man# dies he has only his skin in the same #way# on retiring from #business# you have #nothing# but your real principal of about five or six #million# at the most for third rate #fortune# are never more than a fourth of what they appear to be like the locomotive on a railway the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam surrounding it
well out of the five or six #million# which form your real capital you have just lost nearly two #million# which must of #course# in the same degree diminish your credit and fictitious #fortune# to follow out my simile your skin has been opened by bleeding and this if repeated three or four #time# #will# cause #death#
tell me have you ever #thought# that seven #time# #franc# make nearly twelve #million# no you have not well so pay #attention# to it my dear $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
do you want #money# do you #wish# me to lend you some what a bad calculator you are exclaimed $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ calling to his assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation
i have made #money# at the same #time# by speculations which have succeeded i have made up the loss of #blood# by nutrition
i lost a battle in spain i have been defeated in trieste but my naval army in india #will# have taken some galleons and my mexican pioneers #will# have discovered some mine
no for i am only embarked in certainties replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with the #air# of a mountebank sounding his own praises to involve me three governments must crumble to dust
very good very good but the wound remains and #will# reopen at the first loss
well such #thing# have been that there should be a famine recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine
or that the #sea# should become dry as in the #day# of pharaoh and even then my #vessel# would become caravans
so much the better i congratulate you my dear $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said $m_de_monte_cristo$ i see i was deceived and that you belong to the class of second rate #fortune#
i think i may aspire to that #honor# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with a #smile# which reminded $m_de_monte_cristo$ of the sickly moons which bad artists are so fond of daubing into their pictures of ruins
but while we are speaking of #business# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ added pleased to find an opportunity of changing the #subject# tell me what i am to do for $monsieur_cavalcanti$
excellent he presented himself this #morning# with a bond of #franc# payable at #sight# on you signed by $abbé_busoni$ and returned by you to me with your endorsement of #course# i immediately counted him over the forty bank #note#
give him #money# if he is recommended to you and the recommendation seems good $m_de_monte_cristo$ nodded his #head# in token of assent
but that is not all continued $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ he has opened an #account# with my $house_of_peers$ for his #son#
may i ask how much he allows the young #man# five thousand #franc# per #month# sixty thousand #franc# per #year#
i #thought# i was #right# in believing that $monsieur_cavalcanti$ to be a stingy #fellow# how can a young #man# live upon #franc# a #month#
but you understand that if the young #man# should want a few thousands more do not advance it the #father# #will# never repay it
you do not know these ultramontane millionaires they are regular misers and by whom were they recommended to you
oh by the $house_of_peers$ of fenzi #one# of the best in florence i do not #mean# to say you #will# lose but nevertheless #mind# you hold to the terms of the agreement
would you not trust the $monsieur_cavalcanti$ i oh i would advance ten #million# on his signature i was only speaking in reference to the second rate #fortune# we were mentioning just now
and with all this how unassuming he is i should never have taken him for #anything# more than a mere major
the first #time# i saw him he appeared to me like an old lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets
and you would have flattered him for certainly as you say he has no #manner# but all the italians are the same they are like old jews when they are not glittering in oriental splendor
the young #man# is better said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ yes a little nervous perhaps but upon the whole he appeared tolerable
i was uneasy about him why because you met him at my $house_of_peers$ just after his introduction into the #world# as they told me
he has been travelling with a very severe tutor and had never been to paris before ah i believe noblemen marry amongst themselves do they not
asked $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ carelessly they like to unite their #fortune# it is usual certainly but $monsieur_cavalcanti$ is an original who does #nothing# like #other# #people#
i cannot help thinking that he has brought his #son# to france to choose a #wife# do you think so
#nothing# else was talked of only some said he was worth #million# and #other# that he did not possess a farthing
i am sure of it and you have heard his #fortune# mentioned and what is your #opinion#
i ought not to influence you because it is only my own personal impression well and it is that
my #opinion# is that all these old podestàs these ancient condottieri for the $monsieur_cavalcanti$ have commanded armies and governed provinces my #opinion# i say is that they have buried their #million# in #corner# the #secret# of which they have transmitted only to their eldest #son# who have done the same from generation to generation and the #proof# of this is seen in their yellow and dry #appearance# like the florins of the republic which from being constantly gazed upon have become reflected in them
certainly said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and this is further supported by the #fact# of their not possessing an inch of land
very little at least i know of none which $monsieur_cavalcanti$ possesses excepting his palace in lucca ah he has a palace said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ laughing come that is #something#
yes and more than that he lets it to the #minister# of finance while he #life# in a simple $house_of_peers$
oh as i told you before i think the old #fellow# is very close come you do not flatter him
i scarcely know him i think i have seen him three #time# in my #life# all i know relating to him is through $abbé_busoni$ and himself
he was telling me this #morning# that tired of letting his property lie dormant in italy which is a dead nation he wished to find a method either in france or england of multiplying his #million# but remember that though i #place# great confidence in $abbé_busoni$ i am not responsible for this
it is a fine #name# to inscribe on my ledgers and my cashier was quite proud of it when i explained to him who the $monsieur_cavalcanti$ were
by the #way# this is merely a simple #question# when this #sort# of #people# marry their #son# do they give them any #fortune#
never #mind# accept my #thank# for the client you have sent me oh that depends upon #circumstance#
i know an italian prince rich as a #gold# mine #one# of the noblest #family# in tuscany who when his #son# married according to his #wish# gave them #million# and when they married against his consent merely allowed them thirty crowns a #month#
for example supposing it were the #daughter# of a #banker# he might take an #interest# in the $house_of_peers$ of the #father# in #law# of his #son# then again if he disliked his choice the major takes the key double locks his coffer and #master# $andrea_rondolo$ would be obliged to live like the #son# of a parisian #family# by shuffling cards or rattling the dice
should $andrea_rondolo$ marry according to his #father# views he #will# perhaps give him #one# two or three #million#
ah that #boy# #will# find out some bavarian or peruvian princess he #will# want a crown an el dorado and potosí
no these grand lords on the #other# #side# of the alps frequently marry into plain #family# like jupiter they like to cross the race
but do you #wish# to marry $andrea_rondolo$ my dear $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ that you are asking so many #question#
ma foi said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ it would not be a bad speculation i fancy and you know i am a speculator
you are not thinking of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i #hope# you would not like poor $andrea_rondolo$ to have his throat cut by $m_albert_de_morcerf$
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ repeated $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ shrugging his #shoulder# ah well he would #care# very little about it i think
but he is betrothed to your #daughter# i believe well de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and i have talked about this #marriage# but #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$
you do not #mean# to say that it would not be a good match indeed i imagine that $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is as good as de $m_albert_de_morcerf$
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #fortune# #will# be great no #doubt# especially if the telegraph should not make any more mistakes
oh i do not #mean# her #fortune# only but tell me what why did you not invite and #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ to your #dinner#
i did so but he excused himself on #account# of #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ being obliged to go to dieppe for the benefit of #sea# #air#
yes yes said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ laughing it would do her a great deal of good why so
because it is the #air# she always breathed in her youth $m_de_monte_cristo$ took no notice of this ill natured remark
but still if $m_albert_de_morcerf$ be not so rich as $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said the #count# you must allow that he has a fine #name#
certainly your #name# is popular and does #honor# to the title they have adorned it with but you are too intelligent not to know that according to a prejudice too firmly rooted to be exterminated a nobility which dates back five centuries is worth more than #one# that can only reckon twenty #year#
so he has but i like mine as well and for this very #reason# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with a #smile# which he tried to make sardonic
i prefer $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ still i should not think the morcerfs would yield to the $monsieur_cavalcanti$
the morcerfs stay my dear #count# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ you are a #man# of the #world# are you not
i think so and you understand heraldry a little well #look# at my coat of #arm# it is worth more than $m_albert_de_morcerf$
why so because though i am not a #baron# by birth my real #name# is at least $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
well what then while his #name# is not $m_albert_de_morcerf$ how not $m_albert_de_morcerf$ not the least in the #world#
i have been made a #baron# so that i actually am #one# he made himself a #count# so that he is not #one# at all
go on impossible listen my dear #count# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ has been my #friend# or rather my acquaintance during the last thirty #year#
you know i have made the most of my #arm# though i never forgot my origin a #proof# of great humility or great pride said $m_de_monte_cristo$
well when i was a clerk $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was a mere fisherman and then he was called $m_fernand_mondego$
only $m_fernand_mondego$ $m_fernand_mondego$ you are sure $pardieu$ i have bought enough fish of him to know his #name#
because $m_fernand_mondego$ and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ being both parvenus both having become noble both rich are about equal in worth excepting that there have been certain #thing# mentioned of him that were never said of me
then why did you think of giving your #daughter# to him what oh #nothing#
ah yes what you tell me recalls to #mind# #something# about the #name# of $m_fernand_mondego$ i have heard that #name# in greece
in conjunction with the #affair# of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ exactly so this is the mystery said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
i acknowledge i would have given #anything# to find it out it would be very easy if you much wished it
how so probably you have some correspondent in greece i should think so at $ali_pasha_of_yanina$
well write to your correspondent in $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and ask him what #part# was played by a frenchman named $m_fernand_mondego$ in the catastrophe of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ tepelini
everywhere you are #right# exclaimed $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ rising quickly i #will# write #today# do so
i #will# and if you should hear of #anything# very scandalous i #will# communicate it to you
you #will# oblige me $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ rushed out of the #room# and made but #one# leap into his coupé
the office of the #king# attorney let us leave the #banker# driving his #horse# at their fullest speed and follow #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ in her #morning# excursion
#chapter# we have said that at #half# past twelve clock #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had ordered her #horse# and had left home in the #carriage#
she directed her #course# towards the faubourg saint germain went down the rue mazarine and stopped at the passage du pont neuf
she descended and went through the passage she was very plainly dressed as would be the #case# with a #woman# of taste walking in the #morning#
as soon as she was seated in the vehicle she drew from her #pocket# a very thick black veil which she tied on to her straw bonnet
she then replaced the bonnet and saw with #pleasure# in a little #pocket# mirror that her white complexion and brilliant #eye# were alone visible
the cab crossed the pont neuf and entered the rue de harlay by the #place# dauphine the driver was paid as the #door# opened and stepping lightly up the stairs #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ soon reached the salle des pas perdus
there was a great deal going on that #morning# and many #business# like #person# at the palais #business# like #person# pay very little #attention# to #woman# and #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ crossed the hall without exciting any more #attention# than any #other# #woman# calling upon her lawyer
there was a great press of #people# in $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ antechamber but #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had no occasion even to pronounce her #name#
the #instant# she appeared the #door# keeper rose came to her and asked her whether she was not the #person# with whom the #procureur# had made an appointment and on her affirmative #answer# being given he conducted her by a private passage to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ office
the #magistrate# was seated in an armchair writing with his back towards the #door# he did not move as he heard it open and the #door# keeper pronounce the #word#
walk in #madame# and then reclose it but no sooner had the #man# footsteps ceased than he started up drew the bolts closed the curtains and examined every #corner# of the #room#
then when he had assured himself that he could neither be seen nor heard and was consequently relieved of #doubt# he said
#thank# #madame# #thank# for your punctuality and he offered a #chair# to #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ which she accepted for her #heart# beat so violently that she felt nearly suffocated
at the rue guénégaud she called a cab and directed the driver to go to the rue de harlay
it is a long #time# #madame# said the #procureur# describing a #half# circle with his #chair# so as to #place# himself exactly opposite to #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ it is a long #time# since i had the #pleasure# of speaking alone with you and i regret that we have only now met to enter upon a painful #conversation#
nevertheless #sir# you see i have answered your first appeal although certainly the #conversation# must be much more painful for me than for you
it is true then he said rather uttering his #thought# aloud than addressing his #companion# it is true then that all our actions leave their traces
some sad #other# bright on our paths it is true that every #step# in our #life# is like the #course# of an insect on the sands it leaves its track
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ smiled bitterly alas to many the path is traced by #tear# #sir# said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ you can feel for my #emotion# can you not
when i #look# at this #room# whence so many guilty creatures have departed trembling and ashamed when i #look# at that #chair# before which i now sit trembling and ashamed oh it requires all my #reason# to convince me that i am not a very guilty #woman# and you a menacing judge
spare me then i beseech you $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ dropped his #head# and sighed and i he said i feel that my #place# is not in the judge #seat# but on the #prisoner# bench
you said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ yes i i think #sir# you exaggerate your situation said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ whose beautiful #eye# sparkled for a #moment#
besides the #pleasure# there is always remorse from the indulgence of our passions and after all what have you #man# to #fear# from all this
the paths of which you were just speaking have been traced by all young #man# of ardent imaginations the #world# excuses and notoriety ennobles you
#madame# replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ you know that i am no hypocrite or at least that i never deceive without a #reason#
if my #brow# be severe it is because many #misfortune# have clouded it if my #heart# be petrified it is that it might sustain the blows it has received
i was not so on the #night# of the betrothal when we were all seated around a #table# in the rue du cours at marseilles
but since then #everything# has changed in and about me i am accustomed to brave difficulties and in the conflict to crush those who by their own free #will# or by #chance# voluntarily or involuntarily interfere with me in my career
it is generally the #case# that what we most ardently #desire# is as ardently withheld from us by those who #wish# to obtain it or from whom we attempt to snatch it
errors come before him disguised under the specious form of necessity then after error has been committed in a #moment# of excitement of delirium or of #fear# we see that we might have avoided and escaped it
the #mean# we might have used which we in our blindness could not see then seem simple and easy and we say why did i not do this instead of that
#woman# on the #contrary# are rarely tormented with remorse for the decision does not come from you your #misfortune# are generally imposed upon you and your faults the results of #other# #crime#
in any #case# #sir# you #will# allow replied #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ that even if the fault were alone mine i last #night# received a severe punishment for it
i was not so in my youth thus the greater number of a #man# poor #thing# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ pressing her #hand#
it was too severe for your #strength# for you were twice overwhelmed and yet well well i must tell you
collect all your courage for you have not yet heard all ah exclaimed #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ alarmed what is there more to hear
you only #look# back to the past and it is indeed bad enough well picture to yourself a future more gloomy still certainly frightful perhaps sanguinary
the #baroness# knew how calm $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ naturally was and his present excitement frightened her so much that she opened her mouth to scream but the #sound# died in her throat
how is it that it has escaped from the depths of the tomb and the recesses of our #heart# where it was buried to #visit# us now like a phantom whitening our cheeks and flushing our #brow# with shame
how has this terrible past been recalled cried $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ alas said $hermine$ doubtless it is #chance#
#chance# replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ no no #madame# there is no such #thing# as #chance# oh yes has not a fatal #chance# revealed all this
was it not by #chance# the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ bought that $house_of_peers$ was it not by #chance# he caused the #earth# to be dug up
is it not by #chance# that the unfortunate #child# was disinterred under the #tree# that poor innocent offspring of mine which i never even kissed but for whom i wept many many #tear#
well no #madame# this is the terrible news i have to tell you said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in a hollow #voice# no #nothing# was found beneath the flowers there was no #child# disinterred
ah my #heart# clung to the #count# when he mentioned the dear spoil found beneath the flowers no you must not weep no you must not groan you must tremble
i #mean# that de $m_de_monte_cristo$ digging underneath these #tree# found neither skeleton nor chest because neither of them was there
what can you #mean# asked #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ shuddering neither of them there repeated #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ her staring wide open #eye# expressing her alarm
neither of them there she again said as though striving to impress herself with the meaning of the #word# which escaped her
no said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ burying his #face# in his #hand# no a hundred #time# no then you did not bury the poor #child# there #sir#
and you #will# #pity# me who has for twenty #year# alone borne the heavy burden of #grief# i am about to reveal without casting the least portion upon you
why did you deceive me where did you #place# it tell me where there but listen to me listen
you recollect that sad #night# when you were #half# expiring on that #bed# in the red damask #room# while i scarcely less agitated than you awaited your delivery
oh you frighten me but speak i #will# listen the #child# was born was given to me motionless breathless voiceless we #thought# it dead
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ moved rapidly as though she would spring from her #chair# but $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ stopped and clasped his #hand# as if to implore her #attention#
i placed it in the chest which was to take the #place# of a coffin i descended to the #garden# i dug a hole and then flung it down in haste
scarcely had i covered it with #earth# when the #arm# of the corsican was stretched towards me i saw a #shadow# rise and at the same #time# a flash of #light#
i felt pain i wished to #cry# out but an icy shiver ran through my veins and stifled my #voice# i fell lifeless and fancied myself killed
never shall i forget your sublime courage when having returned to consciousness i dragged myself to the #foot# of the stairs and you almost dying yourself came to meet me
we #thought# it dead he repeated we were obliged to keep silent upon the dreadful catastrophe you had the fortitude to regain the $house_of_peers$ assisted by your nurse
a duel was the pretext for my wound though we scarcely expected it our #secret# remained in our own keeping alone
i was taken to versailles for three #month# i struggled with #death# at last as i seemed to cling to #life# i was ordered to the south
four #man# carried me from paris to châlons walking six leagues a #day# #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ followed the litter in her #carriage#
at châlons i was put upon the saône thence i passed on to the rhône whence i descended merely with the current to arles at arles i was again placed on my litter and continued my journey to marseilles
my recovery lasted six #month# i never heard you mentioned and i did not dare inquire for you when i returned to paris i learned that you the widow of de nargonne had married $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
always the same always the #child# corpse coming every #night# in my #dream# rising from the #earth# and hovering over the grave with menacing #look# and gesture
i inquired immediately on my #return# to paris the $house_of_peers$ had not been inhabited since we left it but it had just been let for nine #year#
i pretended that i disliked the #idea# that a $house_of_peers$ belonging to my #wife# #father# and #mother# should pass into the #hand# of #stranger#
what was the #subject# of my #thought# from the #time# consciousness returned to me i found the tenant i offered to pay them for cancelling the lease they demanded #franc#
i had the #money# with me i made the tenant #sign# the deed of resilition and when i had obtained what i so much wanted i galloped to $auteuil$
i would have given i would have given no #one# had entered the $house_of_peers$ since i had left it
it was five clock in the afternoon i ascended into the red #room# and waited for #night# there all the #thought# which had disturbed me during my #year# of constant agony came back with double force
the corsican who had declared the vendetta against me who had followed me from nîmes to paris who had hid himself in the #garden# who had struck me had seen me dig the grave had seen me inter the #child# he might become acquainted with your #person# nay he might even then have known it
would it not be a sweet revenge for him when he found that i had not died from the blow of his dagger
it was therefore necessary before #everything# else and at all risks that i should cause all traces of the past to disappear that i should destroy every material vestige too much reality would always remain in my recollection
would he not #one# #day# make you pay for keeping this terrible #secret# it was for this i had annulled the lease
it was for this i had come it was for this i was waiting #night# arrived i allowed it to become quite dark
i was without a #light# in that #room# when the wind shook all the #door# behind which i continually expected to see some spy concealed i trembled
i seemed everywhere to hear your moans behind me in the #bed# and i dared not #turn# around my #heart# beat so violently that i feared my wound would open
i understood that i had #nothing# to #fear# that i should neither be seen nor heard so i decided upon descending to the #garden#
listen $hermine$ i consider myself as brave as most #man# but when i drew from my breast the little key of the #staircase# which i had found in my coat that little key we both used to cherish so much which you wished to have fastened to a golden ring when i opened the #door# and saw the pale moon shedding a long stream of white #light# on the spiral #staircase# like a spectre i leaned against the #wall# and nearly shrieked
at #length# #one# by #one# all the #noise# in the neighborhood ceased i seemed to be going mad at last i mastered my agitation
i descended the #staircase# #step# by #step# the only #thing# i could not conquer was a strange trembling in my knees
i grasped the railings if i had relaxed my hold for a #moment# i should have fallen i reached the lower #door#
outside this #door# a spade was placed against the #wall# i took it and advanced towards the thicket i had provided myself with a dark lantern
it was the #end# of november all the verdure of the #garden# had disappeared the #tree# were #nothing# more than skeletons with their long bony #arm# and the dead leaves sounded on the gravel under my #foot#
my #terror# overcame me to such a degree as i approached the thicket that i took a #pistol# from my #pocket# and armed myself
in the middle of the lawn i stopped to #light# it then i continued my path i fancied continually that i saw the figure of the corsican between the branches
i looked carefully around i was indeed alone no #noise# disturbed the #silence# but the owl whose piercing #cry# seemed to be calling up the phantoms of the #night#
i tied my lantern to a forked branch i had noticed a #year# before at the precise #spot# where i stopped to dig the hole
the grass had grown very thickly there during the summer and when autumn arrived no #one# had been there to mow it
i examined the thicket with my dark lantern it was empty still #one# #place# where the grass was thin attracted my #attention# it evidently was there
i had turned up the #ground# i went to #work# the #hour# then for which i had been waiting during the last #year# had at #length# arrived
how i worked how i hoped how i struck every #piece# of turf thinking to find some resistance to my spade
but no i found #nothing# though i had made a hole twice as large as the first i #thought# i had been deceived
i turned around i looked at the #tree# i tried to recall the details which had struck me at the #time#
had mistaken the #spot# a cold sharp wind whistled through the leafless branches and yet the drops fell from my #forehead#
i recollected that i was stabbed just as i was trampling the #ground# to fill up the hole while doing so i had leaned against a laburnum behind me was an artificial rockery intended to serve as a resting #place# for #person# walking in the #garden# in falling my #hand# relaxing its hold of the laburnum felt the coldness of the #stone#
on my #right# i saw the #tree# behind me the #rock# i stood in the same attitude and threw myself down
i rose and again began digging and enlarging the hole still i found #nothing# nothing the chest was no longer there
the chest no longer there murmured #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ choking with #fear# think not i contented myself with this #one# #effort# continued $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
i #thought# the assassin having discovered the chest and supposing it to be a #treasure# had intended carrying it off but perceiving his error had dug another hole and deposited it there but i could find #nothing#
no i searched the whole thicket then the #idea# struck me that he had not taken these precautions and had simply thrown it in a #corner#
in the last #case# i must wait for daylight to renew my search i remained in the #room# and waited
oh heaven when daylight dawned i went down again my first #visit# was to the thicket i hoped to find some traces which had escaped me in the #darkness#
i had turned up the #earth# over a surface of more than twenty #foot# square and a depth of two #foot#
a laborer would not have done in a #day# what occupied me an #hour# but i could find #nothing# absolutely #nothing# then i renewed the search
supposing it had been thrown aside it would probably be on the path which led to the little #gate# but this examination was as useless as the first and with a bursting #heart# i returned to the thicket which now contained no #hope# for me
oh cried #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ it was enough to drive you mad i hoped for a #moment# that it might said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
but that #happiness# was denied me however recovering my #strength# and my #idea# why said i should that #man# have carried away the corpse
but you said replied #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ he would require it as a #proof# ah no #madame# that could not be
dead #body# are not kept a #year# they are shown to a #magistrate# and the evidence is taken now #nothing# of the kind has happened
what then asked $hermine$ trembling violently #something# more terrible more fatal more alarming for us the #child# was perhaps alive and the assassin may have saved it
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ uttered a piercing #cry# and seizing $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #hand# exclaimed my #child# was alive said she you buried my #child# alive
you were not certain my #child# was dead and you buried it ah #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had risen and stood before the #procureur# whose #hand# she wrung in her feeble grasp
i know not i merely suppose so as i might suppose #anything# else replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with a #look# so fixed it indicated that his powerful #mind# was on the verge of #despair# and madness
ah my #child# my poor #child# cried the #baroness# falling on her #chair# and stifling her sobs in her handkerchief
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ becoming somewhat reassured perceived that to avert the maternal storm gathering over his #head# he must inspire #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with the #terror# he felt
you understand then that if it were so said he rising in his #turn# and approaching the #baroness# to speak to her in a lower #tone# we are lost
someone is in #possession# of our #secret# and since $m_de_monte_cristo$ speaks before us of a #child# disinterred when that #child# could not be found it is he who is in #possession# of our #secret#
this #child# #life# and someone knows it #life# just god avenging god murmured #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ only #answer# was a stifled groan
how i have searched for him replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ wringing his #hand# how i have called him in my long sleepless #night# how i have longed for royal wealth to purchase a #million# of #secret# from a #million# of #man# and to find mine among them
at last #one# #day# when for the hundredth #time# i took up my spade i asked myself again and again what the corsican could have done with the #child#
but the #child# the #child# #sir# repeated the agitated #mother# a #child# encumbers a fugitive perhaps on perceiving it was still alive he had thrown it into the river
impossible cried #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ a #man# may murder another out of revenge but he would not deliberately drown a #child#
perhaps continued $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ he had put it in the foundling hospital oh yes yes cried the #baroness# my #child# is there
i ran to the hospital and learned that the same #night# the #night# of the th of september a #child# had been brought there wrapped in #part# of a fine linen napkin purposely torn in #half#
truly truly said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ all my linen is marked thus $monsieur_cavalcanti$ de nargonne was a #baron# and my #name# is $hermine$
this portion of the napkin was marked with #half# a #baron# crown and the #letter# #thank# god my #child# was not then dead
no it was not dead and you can tell me so without fearing to make me die of #joy#
do you believe that if i knew i would relate to you all its trials and all its adventures as would a dramatist or a novel writer
where is the #child# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ shrugged his #shoulder# do i know said he and alas no i know not
a #woman# about six #month# after came to claim it with the #other# #half# of the napkin this #woman# gave all the requisite particulars and it was intrusted to her
but you should have inquired for the #woman# you should have traced her and what do you think i did
i feigned a criminal process and employed all the most acute bloodhounds and skilful agents in search of her they traced her to châlons and there they lost her
they lost her yes forever #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had listened to this recital with a sigh a #tear# or a shriek for every detail
and this is all said she and you stopped there oh no said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i never ceased to search and to inquire
however the last two or three #year# i had allowed myself some respite but now i #will# begin with more perseverance and fury than ever since #fear# urges me not my conscience
but replied #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ can know #nothing# or he would not seek our society as he does
oh the wickedness of #man# is very great said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ since it surpasses the goodness of god
did you observe that #man# #eye# while he was speaking to us no but have you ever watched him carefully
doubtless he is capricious but that is all #one# #thing# alone struck me of all the exquisite #thing# he placed before us he touched #nothing#
i might have suspected he was poisoning us and you see you would have been deceived
for that #reason# i wished to see you to speak to you to warn you against #everyone# but especially against him
tell me cried $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ fixing his #eye# more steadfastly on her than he had ever done before did you ever reveal to #anyone# our connection
yes doubtless but believe me that #man# has #other# projects never to #anyone# you understand me replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ affectionately
when i say #anyone# pardon my urgency to #anyone# living i #mean# yes yes i understand very well ejaculated the #baroness#
never i swear to you were you ever in the habit of writing in the #evening# what had transpired in the #morning#
do you keep a journal no my #life# has been passed in frivolity i #wish# to forget it myself
do you talk in your sleep i sleep soundly like a #child# do you not remember the color mounted to the #baroness#
#face# and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ turned awfully pale it is true said he in so low a #tone# that he could hardly be heard
in less than #one# week from this #time# i #will# ascertain who this de $m_de_monte_cristo$ is whence he comes where he goes and why he speaks in our #presence# of #child# that have been disinterred in a #garden#
well said the #baroness# well i understand what i now have to do replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ villefort pronounced these #word# with an accent which would have made the #count# shudder had he heard him
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ returned in another cab to the passage on the #other# #side# of which she found her #carriage# and her coachman sleeping peacefully on his #box# while waiting for her
then he pressed the #hand# the #baroness# reluctantly gave him and led her respectfully back to the #door# #chapter# a summer ball
the same #day# during the interview between #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and the #procureur# a travelling #carriage# entered the $rue_du_helder$ passed through the gateway of no and stopped in the yard
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ soon left her ordered his #horse# and having arranged his toilet drove to the champs élysées to the $house_of_peers$ of $m_de_monte_cristo$
in a #moment# the #door# was opened and #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ alighted leaning on her #son# #arm# the #count# received him with his habitual #smile#
it was a strange #thing# that no #one# ever appeared to advance a #step# in that #man# favor those who would as it were force a passage to his #heart# found an impassable barrier
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ who ran towards him with open #arm# was chilled as he drew near in #spite# of the friendly #smile# and simply held out his #hand#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ shook it coldly according to his invariable practice here i am dear #count# welcome home again
i arrived an #hour# since from dieppe no from tréport indeed and i have come at once to see you
that is extremely kind of you said $m_de_monte_cristo$ with a #tone# of perfect indifference and what is the news
you should not ask a #stranger# a foreigner for news i know it but in asking for news i #mean# have you done #anything# for me
had you commissioned me said $m_de_monte_cristo$ feigning uneasiness come come said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ do not assume so much indifference
it is said sympathy travels rapidly and when at tréport i felt the electric shock you have either been working for me or thinking of me
possibly said $m_de_monte_cristo$ i have indeed #thought# of you but the magnetic wire i was guiding acted indeed without my knowledge
indeed pray tell me how it happened willingly $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ dined with me i know it to avoid meeting him my #mother# and i left town
but he met here $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ your italian prince not so fast $andrea_rondolo$ only calls himself #count#
calls himself do you say yes calls himself is he not a #count# what can i know of him
he calls himself so i of #course# give him the same title and #everyone# else does likewise what a strange #man# you are
yes with #count# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ the marquis his #father# #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ charming #people# $m_lucien_debray$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ and de $baron_de_château_renaud$
what next you say $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ dined here did they speak of me not a #word#
so much the worse why so i #thought# you wished them to forget you if they did not speak of me i am sure they #thought# about me and i am in #despair#
how #will# that affect you since $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was not among the number here who #thought# of you truly she might have #thought# of you at home
i have no #fear# of that or if she did it was only in the same #way# in which i think of her
listen said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ if $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ were disposed to take #pity# on my supposed martyrdom on her #account# and would dispense with all matrimonial formalities between our two #family# i am ready to agree to the arrangement
touching sympathy so you hate each #other# said the #count# in a #word# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ would make a charming mistress but a #wife# diable
and this said $m_de_monte_cristo$ is your #opinion# of your intended spouse yes it is rather unkind i acknowledge but it is true
but as this #dream# cannot be realized since $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ must become my lawful #wife# live perpetually with me sing to me compose verses and music within ten paces of me and that for my whole #life# it frightens me
#one# may forsake a mistress but a #wife# good heavens there she must always be and to marry $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ would be awful
you are difficult to please viscount yes for i often #wish# for what is impossible
what is that to find such a #wife# as my #father# found $m_de_monte_cristo$ turned pale and looked at $m_albert_de_morcerf$ while playing with some magnificent #pistol#
your #father# was fortunate then said he you know my #opinion# of my #mother# #count# #look# at her still beautiful witty more charming than ever
for any #other# #son# to have stayed with his #mother# for four #day# at tréport it would have been a condescension or a martyrdom while i #return# more contented more peaceful shall i say more poetic than if i had taken queen mab or titania as my #companion#
that is an overwhelming demonstration and you would make #everyone# vow to live a single #life#
such are my #reason# for not liking to marry $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ have you ever noticed how much a #thing# is heightened in value when we obtain #possession# of it
the #diamond# which glittered in the #window# at marlé or fossin shines with more splendor when it is our own but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another and still must retain the #one# that is inferior do you not know what we have to endure
thus i shall rejoice when $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ perceives i am but a pitiful atom with scarcely as many hundred thousand #franc# as she has #million#
#one# #plan# occurred to me continued $m_albert_de_morcerf$ $m_franz_de_quesnel$ likes all that is eccentric i tried to make him fall in #love# with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ but in #spite# of four #letter# written in the most alluring style he invariably answered my eccentricity may be great but it #will# not make me break my #promise#
worldling murmured the #count# $m_de_monte_cristo$ smiled that is what i call devoted friendship to recommend to another #one# whom you would not marry yourself
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ smiled apropos continued he $m_franz_de_quesnel$ is coming soon but it #will# not #interest# you you dislike him i think
i said $m_de_monte_cristo$ my dear viscount how have you discovered that i did not like $m_franz_de_quesnel$
i like #everyone# and you include me in the #expression# #everyone# many #thank# let us not mistake said $m_de_monte_cristo$
i #love# #everyone# as god commands us to #love# our neighbor as christians but i thoroughly hate but a few
yes summoned by $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who is apparently as anxious to get $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ married as $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is to see $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ settled
it must be a very irksome office to be the #father# of a grown up #daughter# it seems to make #one# feverish and to raise #one# pulse to ninety beats a #minute# until the deed is done
let us #return# to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay did you say he was coming but $m_franz_d_épinay$ unlike you bears his #misfortune# patiently
still more he talks seriously about the #matter# puts on a white tie and speaks of his #family# he entertains a very high #opinion# of and #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
which they deserve do they not i believe they do $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ has always passed for a severe but a just #man#
there is then #one# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ whom you do not condemn like poor $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ because i am not compelled to marry his #daughter# perhaps replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ laughing
indeed my dear #sir# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ you are revoltingly foppish i foppish how do you #mean#
yes pray take a cigar and cease to defend yourself and to struggle to escape marrying $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
doubtless my dear viscount you #will# not be taken by force and seriously do you #wish# to break off your engagement
let #thing# take their #course# perhaps you may not have to retract bah said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ staring
i would give a hundred thousand #franc# to be able to do so then make yourself quite easy $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ would give double that #sum# to attain the same #end#
am i indeed so happy said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who still could not prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his #brow#
you would expose the self #love# of another with a hatchet but you shrink if your own is attacked with a needle
but my dear #count# has $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ any #reason# ah there is your proud and selfish #nature#
but yet $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ appeared delighted with you was he not well he is a #man# of bad taste and is still more enchanted with another
i know not whom #look# and judge for yourself #thank# you i understand but my #mother# no not my #mother# i mistake my #father# intends giving a ball
a ball at this season summer balls are fashionable if they were not the #countess# has only to #wish# it and they would become so
you are #right# you know they are select #affair# those who remain in paris in july must be true parisians
#will# you take charge of our invitation to messieurs $monsieur_cavalcanti$ when #will# it take #place# on saturday $monsieur_cavalcanti$ #father# #will# be gone
but the #son# #will# be here #will# you invite young $monsieur_cavalcanti$ i do not know him viscount
you do not know him no i never saw him until a few #day# since and am not responsible for him
but you receive him at your $house_of_peers$ that is another #thing# he was recommended to me by a good #abbé# who may be deceived
if he were afterwards to marry $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ you would accuse me of intrigue and would be challenging me besides i may not be there myself
give him a direct invitation but do not ask me to present him where at your ball
why should you not be there because you have not yet invited me but i come expressly for that #purpose#
you are very kind but i may be prevented if i tell you #one# #thing# you #will# be so amiable as to set aside all impediments
tell me what it is my #mother# begs you to come the comtesse de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said $m_de_monte_cristo$ starting
i assure you #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ speaks freely to me and if you have not felt those sympathetic fibres of which i spoke just now thrill within you you must be entirely devoid of them for during the last four #day# we have spoken of no #one# else
ah #count# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ you have talked of me yes that is the penalty of being a living puzzle
then i am also a puzzle to your #mother# i should have #thought# her too reasonable to be led by imagination
a problem my dear #count# for #everyone# for my #mother# as well as #other# much studied but not solved you still remain an enigma do not #fear#
i believe while the #countess# takes you for $lord_ruthven$ my #mother# imagines you to be cagliostro or the #count# saint germain
the first opportunity you have confirm her in her #opinion# it #will# be easy for you as you have the philosophy of the #one# and the wit of the #other#
my #mother# is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved i #thank# you for the warning said the #count#
i shall endeavor to be prepared for all suppositions you #will# then come on saturday yes since #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ invites me
you are very kind #will# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ be there he has already been invited by my #father#
we shall try to persuade the great aguesseau $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ to come but have not much #hope# of seeing him
never #despair# of #anything# says the proverb do you dance #count# i dance
yes you it would not be astonishing that is very well before #one# is over forty no i do not dance but i like to see #other# do so
does #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ dance never you can talk to her she so delights in your #conversation#
indeed yes truly and i assure you you are the only #man# of whom i have heard her speak with #interest#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ rose and took his hat the #count# conducted him to the #door# i have #one# #thing# to reproach myself with said he stopping $m_albert_de_morcerf$ on the #step#
what is it i have spoken to you indiscreetly about $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ on the #contrary# speak to me always in the same strain about him
i am glad to be reassured on that #point# apropos when do you aspect $m_franz_d_épinay$ five or six #day# hence at the latest
and when is he to be married immediately on the arrival of and $madame_de_saint_méran$
bring him to see me although you say i do not like him i assure you i shall be happy to see him
i #will# obey your #order# my lord good bye until saturday when i may expect you may i not
yes i promised you the #count# watched $m_albert_de_morcerf$ waving his #hand# to him when he had mounted his phaeton $m_de_monte_cristo$ turned and seeing $m_bertuccio$
what news said he she went to the palais replied the steward did she stay long there
an #hour# and a #half# did she #return# home directly well my dear $m_bertuccio$ said the #count#
$m_bertuccio$ bowed and as his #wish# were in perfect harmony with the #order# he had received he started the same #evening#
i now advise you to go in quest of the little estate i spoke to you of in normandy #chapter#
the inquiry $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ kept the #promise# he had made to #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to endeavor to find out how the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ had discovered the history of the $house_of_peers$ at $auteuil$
he wrote the same #day# for the required information to $m_de_boville$ who from having been an #inspector# of #prison# was promoted to a high office in the #police# and the latter begged for two #day# #time# to ascertain exactly who would be most likely to give him full particulars
the #person# called the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ is an intimate acquaintance of $lord_wilmore$ a rich foreigner who is sometimes seen in paris and who is there at this #moment# he is also known to the $abbé_busoni$ a sicilian #priest# of high repute in the east where he has done much good
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ replied by ordering the strictest inquiries to be made respecting these two #person# his #order# were executed and the following #evening# he received these details
the #abbé# who was in paris only for a #month# inhabited a small two storied $house_of_peers$ behind saint sulpice there were two #room# on each #floor# and he was the only tenant
the two lower #room# consisted of a dining #room# with a #table# #chair# and #side# #board# of walnut and a wainscoted parlor without ornaments carpet or timepiece
at the #end# of the second #day# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ received the following #note# it was evident that the #abbé# limited himself to objects of strict necessity
he preferred to #use# the sitting #room# upstairs which was more library than parlor and was furnished with theological books and parchments in which he delighted to bury himself for #month# at a #time# according to his #valet# de chambre
his #valet# looked at the visitors through a #sort# of wicket and if their #face# were unknown to him or displeased him he replied that the #abbé# was not in paris an #answer# which satisfied most #person# because the #abbé# was known to be a great #traveller#
besides whether at home or not whether in paris or cairo the #abbé# always left #something# to give away which the #valet# distributed through this wicket in his #master#
a #bed# without curtains four armchairs and a couch covered with yellow utrecht velvet composed with a prie dieu all its furniture
#name# the #other# #room# near the library was a bedroom $lord_wilmore$ resided in rue fontaine saint georges he was #one# of those english tourists who consume a large #fortune# in travelling
he hired the #apartment# in which he lived furnished passed only a few #hour# in the #day# there and rarely slept there
the #day# after this important information had been given to the #king# attorney a #man# alighted from a #carriage# at the #corner# of the rue férou and rapping at an olive green #door# asked if the $abbé_busoni$ were within
#one# of his peculiarities was never to speak a #word# of french which he however wrote with great facility
i might not always be content with that #answer# replied the visitor for i come from #one# to whom #everyone# must be at home
no he went out early this #morning# replied the #valet# but have the kindness to give the $abbé_busoni$
i told you he was not at home repeated the #valet# then on his #return# give him that card and this sealed #paper#
#will# he be at home at eight clock this #evening# doubtless unless he is at #work# which is the same as if he were out
at the appointed #hour# the same #man# returned in the same #carriage# which instead of stopping this #time# at the #end# of the rue férou drove up to the green #door#
i #will# come again at that #time# replied the visitor who then retired he knocked and it opened immediately to admit him
from the #sign# of respect the #valet# paid him he saw that his #note# had produced a good #effect# is the #abbé# at home asked he
the #stranger# ascended a rough #staircase# and before a #table# illumined by a lamp whose #light# was concentrated by a large shade while the #rest# of the #apartment# was in partial #darkness# he perceived the #abbé# in a monk dress with a cowl on his #head# such as was used by learned #man# of the middle #age#
yes he is at #work# in his library but he expects you #sir# replied the #valet# have i the #honor# of addressing the $abbé_busoni$
and you are the #person# whom $m_de_boville$ formerly an #inspector# of #prison# sends to me from the prefect of #police#
asked the visitor yes #sir# replied the #abbé# exactly #sir# #one# of the agents appointed to secure the safety of paris
the #abbé# replaced the large spectacles which covered not only his #eye# but his temples and sitting down motioned to his visitor to do the same
yes #sir# replied the #stranger# with a slight hesitation and blushing i am at your #service# #sir# said the #abbé# with a marked italian accent
the mission with which i am charged #sir# replied the visitor speaking with hesitation is a confidential #one# on the #part# of him who fulfils it and him by whom he is employed
your probity replied the #stranger# is so well known to the prefect that he #wish# as a #magistrate# to ascertain from you some particulars connected with the public safety to ascertain which i am deputed to see you
the #abbé# bowed it is hoped that no ties of friendship or humane consideration #will# induce you to conceal the #truth#
i am a #priest# #sir# and the #secret# of confession for instance must remain between me and god and not between me and human #justice#
provided #sir# the particulars you #wish# for do not interfere with my scruples or my conscience do not alarm yourself $monsieur_cavalcanti$ we #will# duly respect your conscience
at this #moment# the #abbé# pressed down his #side# of the shade and so raised it on the #other# throwing a bright #light# on the #stranger# #face# while his own remained obscured
excuse me #abbé# said the envoy of the prefect of the #police# but the #light# tries my #eye# very much
the #abbé# lowered the shade now #sir# i am listening go on i #will# come at once to the #point#
do you know the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ you #mean# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ zaccone i presume zaccone is not his #name# $m_de_monte_cristo$
$m_de_monte_cristo$ is the #name# of an estate or rather of a #rock# and not a #family# #name#
well be it so let us not dispute about #word# and since de $m_de_monte_cristo$ and zaccone are the same
absolutely the same let us speak of zaccone agreed i asked you if you knew him
extremely well who is he the #son# of a rich shipbuilder in malta i know that is the report but as you are aware the #police# does not content itself with vague reports
however replied the #abbé# with an affable #smile# when that report is in accordance with the #truth# everybody must believe it the #police# as well as all the #rest#
are you sure of what you assert what do you #mean# by that #question# understand #sir# i do not in the least suspect your veracity i ask if you are certain of it
i knew his #father# zaccone ah indeed and when a #child# i often played with the #son# in the timber yards
but whence does he derive the title of #count# you are aware that may be bought
in italy everywhere and his immense riches whence does he procure them they may not be so very great
how much do you suppose he possesses from #one# hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand livres per annum
that is reasonable said the visitor i have heard he had three or four #million# two hundred thousand per annum would make four #million# of capital
but i was told he had four #million# per annum that is not probable do you know this #island# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
certainly #everyone# who has come from palermo naples or rome to france by #sea# must know it since he has passed close to it and must have seen it
i am told it is a delightful #place# it is a #rock# and why has the #count# bought a #rock#
for the sake of being a #count# in italy #one# must have territorial #possession# to be a #count#
you have doubtless heard the adventures of zaccone youth the #father# no the #son# i know #nothing# certain at that period of his #life# i lost #sight# of my young comrade
was he in the wars i think he entered the #service# in what branch in the navy
are you not his confessor no #sir# i believe he is a lutheran a lutheran
i say i believe such is the #case# i do not affirm it besides #liberty# of conscience is established in france
doubtless and we are not now inquiring into his creed but his actions in the #name# of the prefect of #police# i ask you what you know of him
our holy #father# the pope has made him a knight of jesus christ for the #service# he rendered to the christians in the east he has five or six rings as testimonials from eastern monarchs of his #service#
no but he is proud of them he is better pleased with rewards given to the benefactors of #man# than to his destroyers
he passes for a very charitable #man# does he wear them he is a quaker then
exactly he is a quaker with the exception of the peculiar dress has he any #friend# yes #everyone# who knows him is his #friend#
but has he any #enemy# #one# only what is his #name# $lord_wilmore$ where is he
he is in paris just now can he give me any particulars important #one# he was in india with zaccone
do you know his abode it somewhere in the chaussée antin but i know neither the #street# nor the number
are you at variance with the englishman i #love# zaccone and he hates him we are consequently not #friend#
do you think the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ had ever been in france before he made this #visit# to paris
to that #question# i can #answer# positively no #sir# he had not because he applied to me six #month# ago for the particulars he required and as i did not know when i might again come to paris i recommended $monsieur_cavalcanti$ to him
now #sir# i have but #one# #question# more to ask and i charge you in the #name# of #honor# of humanity and of religion to #answer# me candidly
$andrea_rondolo$ no $bartolomeo_cavalcanti$ his #father# what is it #sir# do you know with what design
$m_de_monte_cristo$ purchased a $house_of_peers$ at $auteuil$ certainly for he told me what is it #sir#
to make a lunatic asylum of it similar to that founded by the #count# of pisani at palermo do you know about that institution
i have heard of it it is a magnificent charity having said this the #abbé# bowed to imply he wished to pursue his #study#
the visitor either understood the #abbé# meaning or had no more #question# to ask he arose and the #abbé# accompanied him to the #door#
and although you are said to be rich i #will# venture to offer you #something# for your poor #people# #will# you accept my offering
i am only jealous in #one# #thing# and that is that the relief i give should be entirely from my own resources
my resolution #sir# is unchangeable but you have only to search for yourself and you #will# find alas but too many objects upon whom to exercise your benevolence
the #abbé# once more bowed as he opened the #door# the #stranger# bowed and took his leave and the #carriage# conveyed him straight to the $house_of_peers$ of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
an #hour# afterwards the #carriage# was again ordered and this #time# it went to the rue fontaine saint georges and stopped at no where $lord_wilmore$ lived
you are a great almsgiver said the visitor i #thank# you #sir# however the #stranger# had written to $lord_wilmore$ requesting an interview which the latter had fixed for ten clock
as the envoy of the prefect of #police# arrived ten #minute# before ten he was told that $lord_wilmore$ who was precision and punctuality personified was not yet come in but that he would be sure to #return# as the clock struck
a mantle #piece# with two modern sèvres vases a timepiece representing cupid with his bent bow a mirror with an engraving on each #side#
the visitor was introduced into the #drawing# #room# which was like all #other# furnished #drawing# #room# #one# representing homer carrying his guide the #other#
it was illuminated by lamps with #ground# #glass# shades which gave only a feeble #light# as if out of consideration for the envoy weak #sight#
belisarius begging a grayish #paper# red and black tapestry such was the #appearance# of $lord_wilmore$ #drawing# #room# after ten #minute# expectation the clock struck ten at the fifth stroke the #door# opened and $lord_wilmore$ appeared
he was dressed with all the english peculiarity namely in a blue coat with gilt buttons and high collar in the fashion of a white kerseymere waistcoat and nankeen pantaloons three inches too short but which were prevented by straps from slipping up to the knee
he was rather above the middle height with thin reddish whiskers #light# complexion and #light# #hair# turning rather gray his first remark on entering was
you know #sir# i do not speak french i know you do not like to converse in our language replied the envoy
but you may #use# it replied $lord_wilmore$ i understand it and i replied the visitor changing his idiom know enough of english to keep up the #conversation#
do not put yourself to the slightest inconvenience aw said $lord_wilmore$ with that #tone# which is only known to natives of great britain
the envoy presented his #letter# of introduction which the latter read with english coolness and having finished i understand said he perfectly
but as $lord_wilmore$ in the character of the #count# #enemy# was less restrained in his #answer# they were more numerous he described the youth of $m_de_monte_cristo$ who he said at ten #year# of #age# entered the #service# of #one# of the petty sovereigns of india who make war on the english
then began the #question# which were similar to those which had been addressed to the $abbé_busoni$ it was there
$lord_wilmore$ had first met him and fought against him and in that war zaccone had been taken #prisoner# sent to england and consigned to the hulks whence he had escaped by swimming
then began his travels his duels his caprices then the insurrection in greece broke out and he had served in the grecian ranks
while in that #service# he had discovered a silver mine in the mountains of thessaly but he had been careful to conceal it from #everyone#
after the battle of navarino when the greek government was consolidated he asked of #king# otho a mining grant for that district which was given him
hence that immense #fortune# which in $lord_wilmore$ #opinion# possibly amounted to #one# or two #million# per annum a precarious #fortune# which might be momentarily lost by the failure of the mine
but asked the visitor do you know why he came to france he is speculating in railways said $lord_wilmore$
and as he is an expert chemist and physicist he has invented a new system of telegraphy which he is seeking to bring to perfection
how much does he spend yearly asked the prefect not more than five or six hundred thousand #franc# said $lord_wilmore$
he is a miser hatred evidently inspired the englishman who knowing no #other# reproach to bring on the #count# accused him of avarice
do you know his $house_of_peers$ at $auteuil$ certainly what do you know respecting it do you #wish# to know why he bought it
he supposes there is in the neighborhood of the $house_of_peers$ he has bought a mineral spring equal to those at bagnères luchon and cauterets
yes the #count# is a speculator who #will# certainly ruin himself in experiments he is going to #turn# his $house_of_peers$ into a badhaus as the germans term it
he has already dug up all the #garden# two or three #time# to find the famous spring and being unsuccessful he #will# soon purchase all the contiguous #house#
now as i dislike him and #hope# his railway his electric telegraph or his search for baths #will# ruin him i am watching for his discomfiture which must soon take #place#
what was the cause of your quarrel when he was in england he seduced the #wife# of #one# of my #friend#
i have already fought three duels with him said the englishman the first with the #pistol# the second with the sword and the third with the sabre
why do you not seek revenge and what was the result of those duels
the first #time# he broke my #arm# the second he wounded me in the breast and the third #time# made this large wound
the englishman turned down his shirt collar and showed a scar whose redness proved it to be a recent #one#
but said the envoy you do not go about it in the #right# #way# to kill him if i understand you correctly
so that you see there is a deadly feud between us aw said the englishman
i practice shooting every #day# and every #other# #day# grisier comes to my $house_of_peers$ this was all the visitor wished to ascertain or rather all the englishman appeared to know
the agent arose and having bowed to $lord_wilmore$ who returned his salutation with the stiff politeness of the english he retired
$lord_wilmore$ having heard the #door# close after him returned to his bedroom where with #one# #hand# he pulled off his #light# #hair# his red whiskers his false jaw and his wound to resume the black #hair# dark complexion and pearly teeth of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
the #procureur# felt more at ease although he had learned #nothing# really satisfactory and for the first #time# since the #dinner# party at $auteuil$ he slept soundly
the ball it was in the warmest #day# of july when in due #course# of #time# the saturday arrived upon which the ball was to take #place# at de $m_albert_de_morcerf$
it was ten clock at #night# the branches of the great #tree# in the #garden# of the #count# $house_of_peers$ stood out boldly against the azure canopy of heaven which was studded with golden stars but where the last fleeting clouds of a vanishing storm yet lingered
from the #apartment# on the #ground# #floor# might be heard the #sound# of music with the whirl of the waltz and galop while brilliant streams of #light# shone through the #opening# of the venetian blinds
at this #moment# the #garden# was only occupied by about ten #servant# who had just received #order# from their mistress to prepare the supper the serenity of the weather continuing to increase
until now it had been undecided whether the supper should take #place# in the dining #room# or under a long tent erected on the lawn but the beautiful blue sky studded with stars had settled the #question# in favor of the lawn
the #garden# were illuminated with colored lanterns according to the italian custom and as is usual in #country# where the luxuries of the #table# the rarest of all luxuries in their complete form are well understood the supper #table# was loaded with wax #light# and flowers
it was $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and not the prefect who returned to the $house_of_peers$ of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #chapter# m
at the #time# the #countess# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ returned to the #room# after giving her #order# many #guest# were arriving more attracted by the charming hospitality of the #countess# than by the distinguished #position# of the #count# for owing to the good taste of $mercédès$ #one# was sure of finding some devices at her entertainment worthy of describing or even copying in #case# of need
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ in whom the #event# we have related had caused deep anxiety had hesitated about going to #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ when during the #morning# her #carriage# happened to meet that of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
the latter made a #sign# and when the #carriage# had drawn close together said you are going to #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ are you not
no replied #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i am too ill you are wrong replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ significantly it is important that you should be seen there
do you think so asked the #baroness# i do in that #case# i #will# go
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ therefore came not only beautiful in #person# but radiant with splendor she entered by #one# #door# at the #time# when $mercédès$ appeared at the #door#
he approached paid her some well merited compliments on her toilet and offered his #arm# to conduct her to a #seat#
and the two #carriage# passed on towards their different destinations the #countess# took $m_albert_de_morcerf$ to meet #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_albert_de_morcerf$ looked around him
you are looking for my #daughter# said the #baroness# smiling i confess it replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ could you have been so cruel as not to bring her
she has met $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and has taken her #arm# see they are following us both in white dresses #one# with a bouquet of camellias the #other# with #one# of myosotis
calm yourself but tell me well what do you #wish# to know #will# not the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ be here tonight
i only #mean# that the #count# seems the rage replied the viscount smiling and that you are the seventeenth #person# that has asked me the same #question#
seventeen replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ what do you #mean# the #count# is in fashion i congratulate him upon it
ah to be sure i have not answered you be satisfied we shall have this lion we are among the privileged #one#
and have you replied to #everyone# as you have to me were you at the opera #yesterday#
no he was there ah indeed and did the eccentric #person# commit any new originality
can he be seen without doing so elssler was dancing in le diable boiteux the greek princess was in ecstasies
after the cachucha he placed a magnificent ring on the stem of a bouquet and threw it to the charming danseuse who in the third act to do #honor# to the gift reappeared with it on her #finger#
and the greek princess #will# she be here no you #will# be deprived of that #pleasure# her #position# in the #count# establishment is not sufficiently understood
wait leave me here and go and speak to #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who is trying to attract your #attention#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ bowed to #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and advanced towards #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ whose #lip# opened as he approached i wager #anything# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ interrupting her that i know what you were about to say
well what is it if i guess rightly #will# you confess it yes on your #honor#
on my #honor# you were going to ask me if the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ had arrived or was expected
not at all it is not of him that i am now thinking i was going to ask you if you had received any news of $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_franz_de_quesnel$
yes #yesterday# what did he tell you that he was leaving at the same #time# as his #letter#
well now then the #count# the #count# #will# come of that you may be satisfied you know that he has another #name# besides $m_de_monte_cristo$
no i did not know it $m_de_monte_cristo$ is the #name# of an #island# and he has a #family# #name#
i never heard it well then i am better informed than you his #name# is zaccone
it is possible he is a maltese that is also possible the #son# of a shipowner
really you should relate all this aloud you would have the greatest success he served in india discovered a mine in thessaly and comes to paris to establish a mineral #water# cure at $auteuil$
well i sure said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ this is indeed news am i allowed to repeat it yes but cautiously tell #one# #thing# at a #time# and do not say i told you
why so because it is a #secret# just discovered by whom the #police#
then the news originated at the prefect last #night# paris you can understand is astonished at the #sight# of such unusual splendor and the #police# have made inquiries
well well #nothing# more is wanting than to arrest the #count# as a vagabond on the pretext of his being too rich
indeed that doubtless would have happened if his credentials had not been so favorable poor #count# and is he aware of the danger he has been in
i think not then it #will# be but charitable to inform him when he arrives i #will# not fail to do so
just then a handsome young #man# with bright #eye# black #hair# and glossy moustache respectfully bowed to #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
#madame# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ allow me to present to you $m_maximilian_morrel$ #captain# of spahis #one# of our best and above all of our bravest #officer#
i have already had the #pleasure# of meeting this #gentleman# at $auteuil$ at the $house_of_peers$ of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ replied #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ turning away with marked coldness of #manner#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ extended his #hand# this #answer# and especially the #tone# in which it was uttered chilled the #heart# of poor $m_maximilian_morrel$
but a recompense was in store for him turning around he saw near the #door# a beautiful fair #face# whose large blue #eye# were without any marked #expression# fixed upon him while the bouquet of myosotis was gently raised to her #lip#
the salutation was so well understood that $m_maximilian_morrel$ with the same #expression# in his #eye# placed his handkerchief to his mouth and these two living statues whose #heart# beat so violently under their marble aspect separated from each #other# by the whole #length# of the #room# forgot themselves for a #moment# or rather forgot the #world# in their mutual contemplation
they might have remained much longer lost in #one# another without #anyone# noticing their abstraction the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ had just entered
it was not the coat unexceptional in its cut though simple and unornamented it was not the plain white waistcoat it was not the trousers that displayed the #foot#
we have already said that there was #something# in the #count# which attracted universal #attention# wherever he appeared so perfectly formed
was his pale complexion his waving black #hair# his calm and serene #expression# his dark and melancholy #eye# his mouth chiselled with such marvellous delicacy which so easily expressed such high disdain these were what fixed the #attention# of all upon him
many #man# might have been handsomer but certainly there could be none whose #appearance# was more significant if the #expression# may be used
#everything# about the #count# seemed to have its meaning for the constant habit of #thought# which he had acquired had given an ease and vigor to the #expression# of his #face# and even to the most trifling gesture scarcely to be understood
it was none of these #thing# that attracted the #attention# it yet the parisian #world# is so strange that even all this might not have won #attention#
meanwhile he advanced through the assemblage of #guest# under a battery of curious #glance# towards #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who standing before a mantle #piece# ornamented with flowers had seen his entrance in a looking #glass# placed opposite the #door# and was prepared to receive him
had there not been connected with it a mysterious #story# gilded by an immense #fortune# she turned towards him with a serene #smile# just at the #moment# he was bowing to her
no #doubt# she fancied the #count# would speak to her while on his #side# the #count# #thought# she was about to address him but both remained silent and after a mere bow $m_de_monte_cristo$ directed his #step# to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who received him cordially
have you seen my #mother# asked $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i have just had the #pleasure# replied the #count# but i have not seen your #father#
see he is down there talking politics with that little group of great geniuses indeed said $m_de_monte_cristo$
and so those #gentleman# down there are #man# of great talent i should not have guessed it and for what kind of talent are they celebrated
that tall harsh looking #man# is very learned he discovered in the neighborhood of rome a kind of lizard with a vertebra more than lizards usually have and he immediately laid his discovery before the institute
you know there are different #sort# the #thing# was discussed for a long #time# but finally decided in his favor
i can assure you the vertebra made a great #noise# in the learned #world# and the #gentleman# who was only a knight of the legion of #honor# was made an #officer#
come said $m_de_monte_cristo$ this cross seems to me to be wisely awarded i suppose had he found another additional vertebra they would have made him a commander
and who can that #person# be who has taken it into his #head# to wrap himself up in a blue coat embroidered with green
oh that coat is not his own #idea# it is the republic which deputed david to devise a uniform for the academicians
very likely said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ indeed said $m_de_monte_cristo$ so this #gentleman# is an academician
within the last week he has been made #one# of the learned assembly and what is his especial talent
i believe he thrusts pins through the #head# of rabbits he makes fowls eat madder and punches the spinal marrow out of dogs with whalebone
his talent and he is made a member of the academy of sciences for this no of the french academy
but what has the french academy to do with all this i was going to tell you
it seems that his experiments have very considerably advanced the cause of science doubtless no that his style of writing is very good
this must be very flattering to the #feeling# of the rabbits into whose #head# he has thrust pins to the fowls whose bones he has dyed red and to the dogs whose spinal marrow he has punched out $m_albert_de_morcerf$ laughed
and the #other# #one# demanded the #count# that #one# yes the third the #one# in the dark blue coat
he is a colleague of the #count# and #one# of the most active opponents to the #idea# of providing the #chamber# of peers with a uniform
he stood badly with the liberal #paper# but his noble opposition to the #wish# of the #court# is now getting him into favor with the journalists
yes he was very successful upon that #question# they talk of making him an ambassador and what are his claims to the peerage
he has composed two or three comic operas written four or five articles in the siècle and voted five or six #year# on the ministerial #side#
bravo viscount said $m_de_monte_cristo$ smiling you are a delightful cicerone and now you #will# do me a favor
#will# you not what is it do not introduce me to any of these #gentleman# and should they #wish# it you #will# warn me
just then the #count# felt his #arm# pressed he turned round it was $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ ah is it you #baron# said he
why do you call me #baron# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ you know that i #care# #nothing# for my title i am not like you viscount you like your title do you not
certainly replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ seeing that without my title i should be #nothing# while you sacrificing the #baron# would still remain the millionaire
which seems to me the finest title under the royalty of july replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ unfortunately said $m_de_monte_cristo$ #one#
title to a millionaire does not last for #life# like that of #baron# peer of france or academician for example the millionaires franck poulmann of frankfurt who have just become bankrupts
indeed said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ becoming pale yes i received the news this #evening# by a courier i had about a #million# in their #hand# but warned in #time#
i withdrew it a #month# ago ah mon dieu exclaimed $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ they have drawn on me for #franc#
well you can throw out the draft their signature is worth five per cent yes but it is too late said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
hush do not mention these #thing# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ then approaching $m_de_monte_cristo$ he added especially before young $monsieur_cavalcanti$ after which he smiled and turned towards the young #man# in #question#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ had left the #count# to speak to his #mother# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to converse with young $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_de_monte_cristo$ was for an #instant# alone
i have honored their bills then said $m_de_monte_cristo$ here are #franc# gone after meanwhile the heat became excessive
$m_de_monte_cristo$ wiped the perspiration from his #forehead# but drew back when the waiter was presented to him he took no refreshment
#madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ did not lose #sight# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ she saw that he took #nothing# and even noticed his gesture of refusal
the footmen were hastening through the #room# with waiters loaded with ices $m_albert_de_morcerf$ she asked did you notice that
what #mother# that the #count# has never been willing to partake of food under the roof of de $m_albert_de_morcerf$
yes but then he breakfasted with me indeed he made his first #appearance# in the #world# on that occasion
but your $house_of_peers$ is not de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ murmured $mercédès$ and since he has been here i have watched him
well well he has taken #nothing# yet the #count# is very temperate $mercédès$ smiled sadly
approach him said she and when the next waiter passes insist upon his taking #something# but why #mother#
just to please me $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said $mercédès$ $m_albert_de_morcerf$ kissed his #mother# #hand# and drew near the #count# another salver passed loaded like the preceding #one# she saw $m_albert_de_morcerf$ attempt to persuade the #count# but he obstinately refused
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ rejoined his #mother# she was very pale well said she you see he refuses yes but why need this annoy you
you know $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #woman# are singular creatures i should like to have seen the #count# take #something# in my $house_of_peers$ if only an ice
perhaps he cannot reconcile himself to the french style of living and might prefer #something# else oh no i have seen him eat of #everything# in italy no #doubt# he does not feel inclined this #evening#
and besides said the #countess# accustomed as he is to burning climates possibly he does not feel the heat as we do
i do not think that for he has complained of #feeling# almost suffocated and asked why the venetian blinds were not opened as well as the #window#
in a #word# said $mercédès$ it was a #way# of assuring me that his abstinence was intended
a #minute# afterwards the blinds were thrown open and through the jessamine and clematis that overhung the #window# #one# could see the #garden# ornamented with lanterns and the supper laid under the tent
and she left the #room# dancers players talkers all uttered an exclamation of #joy# #everyone# inhaled with delight the breeze that floated in
at the same #time# $mercédès$ reappeared paler than before but with that imperturbable #expression# of #countenance# which she sometimes wore she went straight to the group of which her #husband# formed the centre
do not detain those #gentleman# here #count# she said they would prefer i should think to breathe in the #garden# rather than suffocate here since they are not playing
ah said a gallant old general who in had sung partant pour la syrie we #will# not go alone to the #garden#
then said $mercédès$ i #will# lead the #way# turning towards $m_de_monte_cristo$ she added #count# #will# you oblige me with your #arm#
it was only a momentary #glance# but it seemed to the #countess# to have lasted for a century so much was expressed in that #one# #look#
he offered his #arm# to the #countess# she took it or rather just touched it with her little #hand# and they together descended the #step# lined with rhododendrons and camellias
the #count# almost staggered at these simple #word# then he fixed his #eye# on $mercédès$ behind them by another outlet a group of about twenty #person# rushed into the #garden# with loud exclamations of delight
#chapter# bread and salt #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ entered an archway of #tree# with her #companion# it led through a grove of lindens to a conservatory
it was too warm in the #room# was it not #count# she asked yes #madame# and it was an excellent #idea# of yours to open the #door# and the blinds
but you he said with that #light# dress and without #anything# to cover you but that gauze scarf perhaps you feel cold
as he ceased speaking the #count# felt the #hand# of $mercédès$ tremble do you know where i am leading you said the #countess# without replying to the #question#
no #madame# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ but you see i make no resistance we are going to the greenhouse that you see at the #other# #end# of the grove
the #count# looked at $mercédès$ as if to interrogate her but she continued to walk on in #silence# and he refrained from speaking
they reached the building ornamented with magnificent fruits which ripen at the beginning of july in the artificial temperature which takes the #place# of the sun so frequently absent in our climate
see #count# she said with a #smile# so sad in its #expression# that #one# could almost detect the #tear# on her eyelids see our french grapes are not to be compared i know with yours of sicily and cyprus but you #will# make allowance for our northern sun
the #countess# left the #arm# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ and gathered a bunch of muscatel grapes the #count# bowed but stepped back
do you refuse said $mercédès$ in a tremulous #voice# pray excuse me #madame# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ but i never eat muscatel grapes
$mercédès$ let them fall and sighed a magnificent peach was hanging against an adjoining #wall# ripened by the same artificial heat
$mercédès$ drew near and plucked the fruit take this peach then she said the #count# again refused what again
she exclaimed in so plaintive an accent that it seemed to stifle a sob really you pain me a long #silence# followed the peach like the grapes fell to the #ground#
#count# added $mercédès$ with a supplicating #glance# there is a beautiful arabian custom which makes eternal #friend# of those who have together eaten bread and salt under the same roof
but we are in france and not in arabia and in france eternal friendships are as rare as the custom of dividing bread and salt with #one# another
but said the #countess# breathlessly with her #eye# fixed on $m_de_monte_cristo$ whose #arm# she convulsively pressed with both #hand# we are #friend# are we not
the #count# became pale as #death# the #blood# rushed to his #heart# and then again rising dyed his cheeks with crimson his #eye# swam like those of a #man# suddenly dazzled
i know it #madame# replied the #count# certainly we are #friend# he replied why should we not be
the #answer# was so little like the #one# $mercédès$ desired that she turned away to give vent to a sigh which sounded more like a groan
#thank# you she said and they walked on again they went the whole #length# of the #garden# without uttering a #word#
#sir# suddenly exclaimed the #countess# after their walk had continued ten #minute# in #silence# is it true that you have seen so much travelled so far and suffered so deeply
i have suffered deeply #madame# answered $m_de_monte_cristo$ but now you are happy doubtless replied the #count# since no #one# hears me complain
and your present #happiness# has it softened your #heart# my present #happiness# equals my past misery said the #count#
are you not married asked the #countess# i married exclaimed $m_de_monte_cristo$ shuddering who could have told you so
no #one# told me you were but you have frequently been seen at the opera with a young and lovely #woman#
she is a slave whom i bought at constantinople #madame# the #daughter# of a prince i have adopted her as my #daughter# having no #one# else to #love# in the #world#
you live alone then i do you have no sister no #son# no #father#
i have no #one# how can you exist thus without #anyone# to attach you to #life# it is not my fault #madame#
at malta i loved a young #girl# was on the #point# of marrying her when war came and carried me away
i #thought# she loved me well enough to wait for me and even to remain faithful to my memory when i returned she was married
perhaps my #heart# was weaker than the #heart# of most #man# and i suffered more than they would have done in my #place# that is all
this is the history of most #man# who have passed twenty #year# of #age# the #countess# stopped for a #moment# as if gasping for breath
yes she said and you have still preserved this #love# in your #heart# #one# can only #love# once and did you ever see her again
never never i never returned to the #country# where she lived to malta
yes malta she is then now at malta i think so and have you forgiven her for all she has made you suffer
her yes but only her do you then still hate those who separated you i hate them not at all why should i
the #countess# placed herself before $m_de_monte_cristo$ still holding in her #hand# a portion of the perfumed grapes take some she said
#madame# i never eat muscatel grapes replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ as if the #subject# had not been mentioned before the #countess# dashed the grapes into the nearest thicket with a gesture of #despair#
inflexible #man# she murmured $m_de_monte_cristo$ remained as unmoved as if the reproach had not been addressed to him
what has happened asked the #countess# as though awakening from a sleep to the realities of #life# did you say a #misfortune#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ at this #moment# ran in oh #mother# he exclaimed such a #misfortune# has happened what indeed i should expect #misfortune#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ is here well he comes to fetch his #wife# and #daughter# why so
because $madame_de_saint_méran$ is just arrived in paris bringing the news of de $madame_de_saint_méran$ #death# which took #place# on the first stage after he left marseilles
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who was in very good spirits would neither believe nor think of the #misfortune# but $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ at the first #word# guessed the whole #truth# notwithstanding all the precautions of her #father# the blow struck her like a thunderbolt and she fell senseless
and how was de $madame_de_saint_méran$ related to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ said the #count# he was her #grandfather# on the #mother# #side#
he was coming here to hasten her #marriage# with $m_franz_de_quesnel$ ah indeed so $m_franz_de_quesnel$ must wait why was not
m de $madame_de_saint_méran$ also #grandfather# to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_albert_de_morcerf$ albert said #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in a #tone# of mild reproof
what are you saying ah #count# he esteems you so highly tell him that he has spoken amiss and she took two or three #step# forward
$m_de_monte_cristo$ watched her with an #air# so thoughtful and so full of affectionate admiration that she turned back and grasped his #hand# at the same #time# she seized that of her #son# and joined them together
oh #madame# i do not presume to call myself your #friend# but at all #time# i am your most respectful #servant#
the #countess# left with an indescribable pang in her #heart# and before she had taken ten #step# the #count# saw her raise her handkerchief to her #eye#
we are #friend# are we not she asked do not my #mother# and you agree asked $m_albert_de_morcerf$ astonished
on the #contrary# replied the #count# did you not hear her declare that we were #friend# they re entered the #drawing# #room# which $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had just quitted
it is perhaps needless to add that $m_maximilian_morrel$ departed almost at the same #time# #chapter# $madame_de_saint_méran$ a gloomy #scene# had indeed just passed at the $house_of_peers$ of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
after the #lady# had departed for the ball whither all the entreaties of #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had failed in persuading him to accompany them the #procureur# had shut himself up in his #study# according to his custom with a heap of #paper# calculated to alarm #anyone# else but which generally scarcely satisfied his inordinate #desire#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had secluded himself not to #study# but to reflect and with the #door# locked and #order# given that he should not be disturbed excepting for important #business# he sat down in his armchair and began to ponder over the #event# the remembrance of which had during the last eight #day# filled his #mind# with so many gloomy #thought# and bitter recollections
then instead of plunging into the mass of documents piled before him he opened the drawer of his desk touched a spring and drew out a parcel of cherished memoranda amongst which he had carefully arranged in characters only known to himself the #name# of all those who either in his political career in #money# #matter# at the bar or in his mysterious #love# #affair# had become his #enemy#
their number was formidable now that he had begun to #fear# and yet these #name# powerful though they were had often caused him to #smile# with the same kind of satisfaction experienced by a #traveller# who from the summit of a mountain beholds at his #foot# the craggy eminences the almost impassable paths and the fearful chasms through which he has so perilously climbed
when he had run over all these #name# in his memory again read and studied them commenting meanwhile upon his lists he shook his #head#
no he murmured none of my #enemy# would have waited so patiently and laboriously for so long a space of #time# that they might now come and crush me with this #secret#
but this #time# the #paper# were a mere #matter# of form sometimes as hamlet says foul deeds #will# rise though all the #earth# erwhelm them to #man#
#eye# but like a phosphoric #light# they rise but to mislead the #story# has been told by the corsican to some #priest# who in his #turn# has repeated it
$m_de_monte_cristo$ may have heard it and to enlighten himself but why should he #wish# to enlighten himself upon the #subject#
what #interest# can this de $m_de_monte_cristo$ or zaccone #son# of a shipowner of malta discoverer of a mine in thessaly now visiting paris for the first #time# what #interest# i say can he take in discovering a gloomy mysterious and useless #fact# like this
however among all the incoherent details given to me by the $abbé_busoni$ and by $lord_wilmore$ by that #friend# and that #enemy# #one# #thing# appears certain and clear in my #opinion#
asked $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ after a #moment# reflection that in no period in no #case# in no #circumstance# could there have been any contact between him and me
he dreaded not so much the revelation for he could reply to or deny its #truth# he cared little for that mene mene tekel upharsin which appeared suddenly in #letter# of #blood# upon the #wall# but what he was really anxious for was to discover whose #hand# had traced them
while he was endeavoring to calm his #fear# and instead of dwelling upon the political future that had so often been the #subject# of his ambitious #dream# was imagining a future limited to the enjoyments of home in #fear# of awakening the #enemy# that had so long slept the #noise# of a #carriage# sounded in the yard then he heard the #step# of an aged #person# ascending the stairs followed by #tear# and lamentations such as #servant# always give vent to when they #wish# to appear interested in their #master# #grief#
he drew back the bolt of his #door# and almost directly an old #lady# entered unannounced carrying her shawl on her #arm# and her bonnet in her #hand#
the white #hair# was thrown back from her yellow #forehead# and her #eye# already sunken by the furrows of #age# now almost disappeared beneath the eyelids swollen with #grief#
but $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ uttered #word# which even he himself did not believe oh #sir# she said oh #sir# what a #misfortune#
i shall die of it oh yes i shall certainly die of it and then falling upon the #chair# nearest the #door# she burst into a paroxysm of sobs
the #servant# standing in the doorway not daring to approach nearer were looking at $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ old #servant# who had heard the #noise# from his #master# #room# and run there also remaining behind the #other#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ rose and ran towards his #mother# in #law# for it was she why what can have happened he exclaimed what has thus disturbed you
is de $madame_de_saint_méran$ with you de $madame_de_saint_méran$ is dead answered the old marchioness without preface and without #expression# she appeared to be stupefied
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ drew back and clasping his #hand# together exclaimed dead so suddenly a week ago continued $madame_de_saint_méran$ we went out together in the #carriage# after #dinner#
m de $madame_de_saint_méran$ had been unwell for some #day# still the #idea# of seeing our dear $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ again inspired him with courage and notwithstanding his illness he would leave
at six leagues from marseilles after having eaten some of the lozenges he is accustomed to take he fell into such a deep sleep that it appeared to me unnatural still i hesitated to wake him although i fancied that his #face# was flushed and that the veins of his temples throbbed more violently than usual
however as it became dark and i could no longer see i fell asleep i was soon aroused by a piercing shriek as from a #person# suffering in his #dream# and he suddenly threw his #head# back violently
i called the #valet# i stopped the postilion i spoke to de $madame_de_saint_méran$ i applied my smelling salts but all was over and i arrived at aix by the #side# of a corpse
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ stood with his mouth #half# open quite stupefied of #course# you sent for a #doctor# immediately but as i have told you it was too late
yes but then he could tell of what complaint the poor marquis had died oh yes #sir# he told me it appears to have been an apoplectic stroke
de $madame_de_saint_méran$ had always expressed a #desire# in #case# his #death# happened during his absence from paris that his #body# might be brought to the #family# vault
and what did you do then i had him put into a leaden coffin and i am preceding him by a few #day#
oh my poor #mother# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ to have such #duty# to perform at your #age# after such a blow
god has supported me through all and then my dear marquis he would certainly have done #everything# for me that i performed for him
it is true that since i left him i seem to have lost my senses i cannot #cry# at my #age# they say that we have no more #tear# still
i think that when #one# is in trouble #one# should have the #power# of weeping where is $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #sir# it is on her #account# i am here i #wish# to see $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #thought# it would be terrible to reply that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was at a ball so he only said that she had gone out with her #step# #mother# and that she should be fetched
this #instant# #sir# this #instant# i beseech you said the old #lady# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ placed the #arm# of $madame_de_saint_méran$ within his own and conducted her to his #apartment#
the marchioness raised her #head# at this #word# and beholding the #man# who so forcibly reminded her of her deeply regretted #child# who still lived for her in $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ she felt touched at the #name# of #mother# and bursting into #tear# she fell on her knees before an armchair where she buried her venerable #head#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ left her to the #care# of the #woman# while old $barrois$ ran #half# scared to his #master# for #nothing# frightens old #people# so much as when #death# relaxes its vigilance over them for a #moment# in #order# to strike some #other# old #person#
then while $madame_de_saint_méran$ remained on her knees praying fervently $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ sent for a cab and went himself to fetch his #wife# and #daughter# from #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$
#rest# yourself #mother# he said he was so pale when he appeared at the #door# of the ball #room# that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ ran to him saying
oh #father# some #misfortune# has happened your grandmamma has just arrived $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and grandpapa inquired the young #girl# trembling with apprehension
it was just in #time# for $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #head# swam and she staggered #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ instantly hastened to her assistance and aided her #husband# in dragging her to the #carriage# saying
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ only replied by offering his #arm# to his #daughter# what a singular #event# who could have #thought# it
ah yes it is indeed strange and the wretched #family# departed leaving a cloud of sadness hanging over the #rest# of the #evening#
at the #foot# of the stairs $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ found $barrois$ awaiting her $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #wish# to see you tonight he said in an undertone
tell him i #will# come when i leave my dear grandmamma she replied #feeling# with true delicacy that the #person# to whom she could be of the most #service# just then was $madame_de_saint_méran$
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ found her grandmother in #bed# silent caresses heartwrung sobs broken sighs burning #tear# were all that passed in this sad interview while #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ leaning on her #husband# #arm# maintained all outward forms of respect at least towards the poor widow
i think it would be better for me to retire with your permission for the #sight# of me appears still to afflict your #mother# in #law#
she soon whispered to her #husband# $madame_de_saint_méran$ heard her yes yes she said softly to $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ let her leave but do you stay
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ left and $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ remained alone beside the #bed# for the #procureur# overcome with #astonishment# at the unexpected #death# had followed his #wife#
meanwhile $barrois$ had returned for the first #time# to old $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who having heard the #noise# in the $house_of_peers$ had as we have said sent his old #servant# to inquire the cause
on his #return# his quick intelligent #eye# interrogated the messenger alas #sir# exclaimed $barrois$ a great #misfortune# has happened
m de $madame_de_saint_méran$ and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had never been on strict terms of friendship still the #death# of #one# old #man# always considerably affects another
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ let his #head# fall upon his chest apparently overwhelmed and thoughtful then he closed #one# #eye# in token of inquiry
$madame_de_saint_méran$ has arrived and her #husband# is dead $barrois$ asked $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ nodded his #head# she is at the ball as you know since she came to say good bye to you in full dress
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ again closed his left #eye# do you #wish# to see her $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ again made an affirmative #sign#
well they have gone to fetch her no #doubt# from #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i #will# await her #return# and beg her to come up here
is that what you #wish# for yes replied the invalid $barrois$ therefore as we have seen watched for $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and informed her of her #grandfather# #wish#
consequently $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ came up to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ on leaving $madame_de_saint_méran$ who in the midst of her #grief# had at last yielded to fatigue and fallen into a feverish sleep
within reach of her #hand# they placed a small #table# upon which stood a bottle of orangeade her usual beverage and a #glass#
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ kissed the old #man# who looked at her with such tenderness that her #eye# again filled with #tear# whose sources he #thought# must be exhausted
then as we have said the young #girl# left the bedside to see $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the old #gentleman# continued to dwell upon her with the same #expression#
yes yes said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ you #mean# that i have yet a kind #grandfather# left do you not the old #man# intimated that such was his meaning
ah yes happily i have replied $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ without that what would become of me it was #one# clock in the #morning#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ would not say that the only #rest# he needed was to see his #child# but wished her good #night# for #grief# and fatigue had made her appear quite ill
the next #morning# she found her grandmother in #bed# the fever had not abated on the #contrary# her #eye# glistened and she appeared to be suffering from violent nervous irritability
$barrois$ who wished to go to #bed# himself observed that after such sad #event# #everyone# stood in need of #rest#
oh dear grandmamma are you worse exclaimed $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ perceiving all these #sign# of agitation no my #child# no said $madame_de_saint_méran$
but i was impatiently waiting for your arrival that i might send for your #father# my #father# inquired $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ uneasily
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ durst not oppose her grandmother #wish# the cause of which she did not know and an #instant# afterwards $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ entered
#sir# said $madame_de_saint_méran$ without using any circumlocution and as if fearing she had no #time# to lose you wrote to me concerning the #marriage# of this #child#
yes i #wish# to speak to him yes #madame# replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ it is not only projected but arranged
is he not the #son# of general épinay who was on our #side# and who was assassinated some #day# before the usurper returned from the #island# of $elba$
your intended #son# in #law# is named $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay yes #madame# the same
our civil dissensions are now happily extinguished #mother# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ $m_franz_d_épinay$ was quite a #child# when his #father# died he knows very little of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and #will# meet him if not with #pleasure# at least with indifference
does he not dislike the #idea# of marrying the granddaughter of a jacobin is it a suitable match
in every respect and the young #man# is regarded with universal esteem you approve of him
he is #one# of the most well bred young #man# i know during the whole of this #conversation# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had remained silent
well #sir# said $madame_de_saint_méran$ after a few #minute# reflection i must hasten the #marriage# for i have but a short #time# to live
you #madame# you dear mamma exclaimed $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ at the same #time# i know what i am saying continued the marchioness
i must hurry you so that as she has no #mother# she may at least have a grandmother to bless her #marriage#
i am all that is left to her belonging to my poor $renée$ whom you have so soon forgotten #sir#
ah #madame# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ you forget that i was obliged to give a #mother# to my #child#
a stepmother is never a #mother# #sir# but this is not to the #purpose# our #business# concerns $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ let us leave the dead in peace
all this was said with such exceeding rapidity that there was #something# in the #conversation# that seemed like the beginning of delirium
it shall be as you #wish# #madame# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ more especially since your #wish# coincide with mine and as soon as $m_franz_d_épinay$ arrives in paris
my dear grandmother interrupted $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ consider decorum the recent #death# you would not have me marry under such sad auspices
my #child# exclaimed the old #lady# sharply let us hear none of the conventional objections that deter weak #mind# from preparing for the future
i also was married at the #death# #bed# of my #mother# and certainly i have not been less happy on that #account#
still that #idea# of #death# #madame# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ still always i tell you i am going to die
i #wish# to tell him to make my #child# happy i #wish# to read in his #eye# whether he intends to obey me in
i #will# continued the old #lady# with a fearful #expression# that i may rise from the depths of my grave to find him if he should not fulfil his #duty#
do you understand well before dying i #wish# to see my #son# in #law# #fact# i #will# know him #madame# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ you must lay aside these exalted #idea# which almost assume the #appearance# of madness
the dead once buried in their graves rise no more and i tell you #sir# that you are mistaken
it seemed as though my soul were already hovering over my #body# my #eye# which i tried to open closed against my #will# and what #will# appear impossible above all to you #sir# i saw with my #eye# shut in the #spot# where you are now standing issuing from that #corner# where there is a #door# leading into #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ dressing #room#
this #night# i have had a fearful sleep i saw i tell you silently enter a white figure $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ screamed
it was the fever that disturbed you #madame# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #doubt# if you please but i am sure of what i say
i saw a white figure and as if to prevent my discrediting the testimony of only #one# of my senses i heard my #glass# removed
so little was it a #dream# that i stretched my #hand# towards the bell but when i did so the shade disappeared my maid then entered with a #light#
the same which is there now on the #table# oh dear #mother# it was a #dream#
it was the soul of my #husband# well if my #husband# soul can come to me why should not my soul reappear to guard my granddaughter
but she saw no #one# phantoms are visible to those only who ought to see them the tie is even more direct it seems to me
oh #madame# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ deeply affected in #spite# of himself do not yield to those gloomy #thought# you #will# long live with us happy loved and honored and we #will# make you forget
never never never said the marchioness when does $m_franz_d_épinay$ #return# we expect him every #moment#
and then i also #wish# to see a #notary# that i may be assured that all our property #return# to $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
it is well as soon as he arrives inform me we must be expeditious ah grandmamma murmured $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ pressing her #lip# on the burning #brow#
do you #wish# to kill me oh how feverish you are we must not send for a #notary# but for a #doctor#
a #doctor# said she shrugging her #shoulder# i am not ill i am thirsty that is all
what are you drinking dear grandmamma the same as usual my dear my #glass# is there on the #table# give it to me $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ poured the orangeade into a #glass# and gave it to her grandmother with a certain degree of dread for it was the same #glass# she fancied that had been touched by the spectre
the marchioness drained the #glass# at a single draught and then turned on her pillow repeating the #notary# the #notary# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ left the #room# and $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ seated herself at the bedside of her grandmother
the poor #child# appeared herself to require the #doctor# she had recommended to her aged relative a bright #spot# burned in either cheek her respiration was short and difficult and her pulse beat with feverish excitement
she was thinking of the #despair# of $m_maximilian_morrel$ when he should be informed that $madame_de_saint_méran$ instead of being an ally was unconsciously acting as his #enemy#
more than once she #thought# of revealing all to her grandmother and she would not have hesitated a #moment# if $m_maximilian_morrel$ had been named $m_albert_de_morcerf$ or raoul de $baron_de_château_renaud$ but $m_maximilian_morrel$ was of plebeian extraction and $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ knew how the haughty marquise de $madame_de_saint_méran$ despised all who were not noble
her #secret# had each #time# been repressed when she was about to reveal it by the sad conviction that it would be useless to do so for were it once discovered by her #father# and #mother# all would be lost
two #hour# passed thus $madame_de_saint_méran$ was in a feverish sleep and the #notary# had arrived though his coming was announced in a very low #tone# $madame_de_saint_méran$ arose from her pillow
the #notary# she exclaimed let him come in the #notary# who was at the #door# immediately entered
the young #girl# kissed her grandmother and left with her handkerchief to her #eye# at the #door# she found the #valet# de chambre who told her that the #doctor# was waiting in the dining #room#
go $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said $madame_de_saint_méran$ and leave me with this #gentleman# but grandmamma leave me go $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ instantly ran down
the #doctor# was a #friend# of the #family# and at the same #time# #one# of the cleverest #man# of the #day# and very fond of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ whose birth he had witnessed
he had himself a #daughter# about her #age# but whose #life# was #one# continued source of anxiety and #fear# to him from her #mother# having been consumptive
oh said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ we have been waiting for you with such impatience dear $m_d_avrigny$ but first of all how are madeleine and antoinette
madeleine was the #daughter# of $m_d_avrigny$ and antoinette his niece $m_d_avrigny$ smiled sadly antoinette is very well he said and madeleine tolerably so
but you sent for me my dear #child# it is not your #father# or #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who is ill as for you although we #doctor# cannot divest our patients of nerves i fancy
you have no further need of me than to recommend you not to allow your imagination to take too wide a field
m avrigny carried the science of divination almost to a miraculous extent for he was #one# of the physicians who always #work# upon the #body# through the #mind#
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ colored no she replied it is for my poor grandmother you know the calamity that has happened to us do you not
i know #nothing# said $m_d_avrigny$ alas said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ restraining her #tear# my #grandfather# is dead
de $madame_de_saint_méran$ yes suddenly from an apoplectic stroke an apoplectic stroke repeated the #doctor#
yes and my poor grandmother fancies that her #husband# whom she never left has called her and that she must go and join him
oh $m_d_avrigny$ i beseech you do #something# for her where is she in her #room# with the #notary#
and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ just as he was his #mind# perfectly clear but the same incapability of moving or speaking
and the same #love# for you eh my dear #child# yes said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ he was very fond of me
an extreme nervous excitement and a strangely agitated sleep she fancied this #morning# in her sleep that her soul was hovering above her #body# which she at the same #time# watched
it must have been delirium she fancies too that she saw a phantom enter her #chamber# and even heard the #noise# it made on touching her #glass#
who does not #love# you $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ smiled sadly what are your grandmother symptoms it is singular said the #doctor#
i was not aware that $madame_de_saint_méran$ was #subject# to such hallucinations it is the first #time# i ever saw her in this condition said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
this #morning# she frightened me so that i #thought# her mad and my #father# who you know is a strong minded #man# himself appeared deeply impressed
and we #will# go and see said the #doctor# what you tell me seems very strange the #notary# here descended and $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was informed that her grandmother was alone
go upstairs she said to the #doctor# and you oh i dare not she forbade my sending for you and as you say i am
myself agitated feverish and out of #sort# i #will# go and take a #turn# in the #garden# to recover myself
the #doctor# pressed $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #hand# and while he visited her grandmother she descended the #step# we need not say which portion of the #garden# was her favorite walk
after remaining for a short #time# in the parterre surrounding the $house_of_peers$ and gathering a rose to #place# in her waist or #hair# she turned into the dark avenue which led to the bench then from the bench she went to the #gate#
the mourning in her #heart# forbade her assuming this simple ornament though she had not yet had #time# to put on the outward semblance of woe
as usual $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ strolled for a short #time# among her flowers but without gathering them she then turned towards the avenue
as she advanced she fancied she heard a #voice# speaking her #name# she stopped astonished then the #voice# reached her ear more distinctly and she recognized it to be that of $m_maximilian_morrel$
with the instinct peculiar to lovers he had anticipated after the #return# of $madame_de_saint_méran$ and the #death# of the marquis that #something# would occur at $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in connection with his attachment for $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
his presentiments were realized as we shall see and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him pale and trembling to the #gate# under the chestnut #tree#
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety and as it was not his accustomed #hour# for visiting her she had gone to the #spot# simply by accident or perhaps through sympathy
#chapter# the #promise# it was indeed $m_maximilian_morrel$ who had passed a wretched existence since the previous #day# $m_maximilian_morrel$ called her and she ran to the #gate#
you here at this #hour# said she yes my poor #girl# replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ i come to bring and to hear bad tidings
this is indeed a $house_of_peers$ of mourning said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ speak $m_maximilian_morrel$ although the cup of sorrow seems already full
dear $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said $m_maximilian_morrel$ endeavoring to conceal his own #emotion# listen i entreat you what i am about to say is very serious
when are you to be married i #will# tell you all said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ from you i have #nothing# to conceal
this #morning# the #subject# was introduced and my dear grandmother on whom i depended as my only support not only declared herself favorable to it but is so anxious for it that they only await the arrival of $m_franz_d_épinay$ and the following #day# the contract #will# be signed
a deep sigh escaped the young #man# who gazed long and mournfully at her he loved alas replied he
the sentence is passed and in a few #hour# #will# be executed it must be so and i #will# not endeavor to prevent it
but since you say #nothing# remains but for $m_franz_d_épinay$ to arrive that the contract may be signed and the following #day# you #will# be his #tomorrow# you #will# be engaged to $m_franz_d_épinay$ for he came this #morning# to paris
it is dreadful thus to hear my condemnation from your own #lip# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ uttered a #cry# i was at the $house_of_peers$ of $m_de_monte_cristo$ an #hour# since said $m_maximilian_morrel$
we were speaking he of the sorrow your #family# had experienced and i of your #grief# when a #carriage# rolled into the courtyard
at the #sound# of that #carriage# i shuddered soon i heard #step# on the #staircase# which terrified me as much as the footsteps of the commander did don juan
the #door# at last opened $m_albert_de_morcerf$ entered first and i began to #hope# my #fear# were vain when after him another young #man# advanced and the #count# exclaimed
never till then had i placed any confidence in presentiments but now i cannot help believing them $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ ah here is the #baron# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay
perhaps i turned pale and trembled but certainly i smiled and five #minute# after i left without having heard #one# #word# that had passed
i summoned all my #strength# and courage to my support poor $m_maximilian_morrel$ murmured $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ valentine the #time# has arrived when you must #answer# me
and remember my #life# depends on your #answer# what do you intend doing $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ held down her #head# she was overwhelmed
it is not the first #time# you have contemplated our present #position# which is a serious and urgent #one# i do not think it is a #moment# to give #way# to useless sorrow leave that for those who like to suffer at their leisure and indulge their #grief# in #secret#
there are such in the #world# and god #will# doubtless reward them in heaven for their resignation on #earth# but those who #mean# to contend must not lose #one# precious #moment# but must #return# immediately the blow which #fortune# strikes
listen said $m_maximilian_morrel$ do you intend to struggle against our ill #fortune# tell me $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ for it is that i came to know
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ trembled and looked at him with amazement the #idea# of resisting her #father# her grandmother and all the #family# had never occurred to her
what do you say $m_maximilian_morrel$ asked $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ what do you #mean# by a struggle oh it would be a sacrilege
what i resist my #father# #order# and my dying grandmother #wish# impossible $m_maximilian_morrel$ started you are too noble not to understand me and you understand me so well that you already yield dear $m_maximilian_morrel$
no no i shall need all my #strength# to struggle with myself and support my #grief# in #secret# as you say
but to grieve my #father# to disturb my grandmother last #moment# never you are #right# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ calmly
in what a #tone# you speak cried $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ i speak as #one# who admires you $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ cried $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ oh selfish #man# he sees me in #despair# and pretends he cannot understand me you mistake
you #will# not oppose $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ you #will# not displease the marchioness and #tomorrow# you #will# #sign# the contract which #will# bind you to your #husband#
i understand you perfectly but mon dieu tell me how can i do otherwise do not appeal to me $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
i shall be a bad judge in such a #case# my selfishness #will# blind me replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ whose low #voice# and clenched #hand# announced his growing desperation
what would you have proposed $m_maximilian_morrel$ had you found me willing to accede it is not for me to say
you are wrong you must advise me what to do do you seriously ask my advice $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said $m_maximilian_morrel$ pushing aside a loose plank give me your #hand# in token of forgiveness of my anger my senses are confused and during the last #hour# the most extravagant #thought# have passed through my brain
certainly dear $m_maximilian_morrel$ for if it is good i #will# follow it you know my devotion to you oh if you refuse my advice
what do you advise said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ raising her #eye# to heaven and sighing i am free replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ and rich enough to support you
i swear to make you my lawful #wife# before my #lip# even shall have approached your #forehead# you make me tremble said the young #girl#
we #will# embark for algiers for england for america or if you prefer it retire to the #country# and only #return# to paris when our #friend# have reconciled your #family#
follow me said $m_maximilian_morrel$ i #will# take you to my sister who is worthy also to be yours
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ shook her #head# i feared it $m_maximilian_morrel$ said she it is the counsel of a madman and i should be more mad than you
did i not stop you at once with the #word# impossible $m_maximilian_morrel$ impossible you #will# then submit to what fate decrees for you without even attempting to contend with it said $m_maximilian_morrel$ sorrowfully
yes if i die well $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ resumed $m_maximilian_morrel$ i can only say again that you are #right# truly it is i who am mad and you prove to me that passion blinds the most well meaning
it is then understood that #tomorrow# you #will# be irrevocably promised to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay not only by that theatrical formality invented to heighten the #effect# of a comedy called the signature of the contract but your own #will#
i appreciate your calm reasoning again you drive me to #despair# $m_maximilian_morrel$ said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ again you plunge the dagger into the wound
what would you do tell me if your sister listened to such a proposition $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ with a bitter #smile#
i am selfish you have already said so and as a selfish #man# i think not of what #other# would do in my situation but of what i intend doing myself
i think only that i have known you not a whole #year# from the #day# i first saw you all my #hope# of #happiness# have been in securing your affection
#one# #day# you acknowledged that you loved me and since that #day# my #hope# of future #happiness# has rested on obtaining you for to gain you would be #life# to me
now i think no more i say only that #fortune# has turned against me i had #thought# to gain heaven and now i have lost it
it is an every #day# occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he possesses but also what he has not
$m_maximilian_morrel$ pronounced these #word# with perfect calmness $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ looked at him a #moment# with her large scrutinizing #eye# endeavoring not to let $m_maximilian_morrel$ discover the #grief# which struggled in her #heart#
i am going to have the #honor# of taking my leave of you $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ solemnly assuring you that i #wish# your #life# may be so calm so happy and so fully occupied that there may be no #place# for me even in your memory
but in a #word# what are you going to do asked she oh murmured $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
cried the young #girl# extending her #hand# through the #opening# and seizing $m_maximilian_morrel$ by his coat for she understood from her own agitated #feeling# that her lover calmness could not be real where are you going
i am going that i may not bring fresh trouble into your #family# and to set an example which every honest and devoted #man# situated as i am may follow
adieu $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ adieu said $m_maximilian_morrel$ bowing where are you going before you leave me tell me what you are going to do $m_maximilian_morrel$
the young #man# smiled sorrowfully speak speak said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ i entreat you has your resolution changed $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ shook the #gate# with a #strength# of which she could not have been supposed to be possessed as $m_maximilian_morrel$ was going away and passing both her #hand# through the #opening# she clasped and wrung them
it cannot change unhappy #man# you know it must not cried the young #girl# then adieu $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
i must know what you #mean# to do said she where are you going oh #fear# not said $m_maximilian_morrel$ stopping at a short #distance#
i do not intend to render another #man# responsible for the rigorous fate reserved for me another might threaten to seek $m_franz_de_quesnel$ to provoke him and to fight with him all that would be folly
what has $m_franz_de_quesnel$ to do with it he saw me this #morning# for the first #time# and has already forgotten he has seen me
he did not even know i existed when it was arranged by your two #family# that you should be united i have no enmity against $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and #promise# you the punishment shall not fall on him
on whom then on me on you $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ oh heaven forbid #woman# is sacred the #woman# #one# loves is holy
on yourself then unhappy #man# on yourself i am the only guilty #person# am i not said $m_maximilian_morrel$
he drew near with his sweet #smile# and but for his paleness #one# might have #thought# him in his usual happy mood
listen my dear my adored $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said he in his melodious and grave #tone# those who like us have never had a #thought# for which we need blush before the #world# such may read each #other# #heart#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ come back i entreat you i never was romantic and am no melancholy hero
i imitate neither manfred nor anthony but without #word# protestations or vows my #life# has entwined itself with yours you leave me and you are #right# in doing so i repeat it you are #right# but in losing you i lose my #life#
my sister is happily married her #husband# is only my #brother# in #law# that is a #man# whom the ties of social #life# alone attach to me no #one# then longer needs my useless #life#
this is what i shall do i #will# wait until the very #moment# you are married for i #will# not lose the #shadow# of #one# of those unexpected #chance# which are sometimes reserved for us since $m_franz_de_quesnel$ may after all die before that #time# a thunderbolt may fall even on the altar as you approach it #nothing#
the #moment# you leave me $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ i am alone in the #world# appears impossible to #one# condemned to die and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape from #death# is concerned
i #will# then wait until the last #moment# and when my misery is certain irremediable hopeless i #will# write a confidential #letter# to my #brother# in #law# another to the prefect of #police# to acquaint them with my intention and at the #corner# of some wood on the brink of some abyss on the bank of some river i #will# put an #end# to my existence as certainly as i am the #son# of the most honest #man# who ever lived in france
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ trembled convulsively she loosened her hold of the #gate# her #arm# fell by her #side# and two large #tear# rolled down her cheeks
the young #man# stood before her sorrowful and resolute oh for #pity# sake said she you #will# live #will# you not
no on my #honor# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ but that #will# not affect you you have done your #duty# and your conscience #will# be at #rest#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ said she $m_maximilian_morrel$ my #friend# my #brother# on #earth# my true #husband# in heaven i entreat you do as i do live in suffering perhaps we may #one# #day# be united
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ fell on her knees and pressed her almost bursting #heart# adieu $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ repeated $m_maximilian_morrel$ my god said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ raising both her #hand# to heaven with a sublime #expression#
i have done my utmost to remain a submissive #daughter# i have begged entreated implored he has regarded neither my prayers my entreaties nor my #tear#
it is done cried she wiping away her #tear# and resuming her firmness i am resolved not to die of remorse but rather of shame
$m_maximilian_morrel$ who had already gone some few #step# away again returned and pale with #joy# extended both #hand# towards $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ through the #opening#
live $m_maximilian_morrel$ and i #will# be yours say when shall it be speak command i #will# obey $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said he dear $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ you must not speak thus rather let me die
why should i obtain you by violence if our #love# is mutual is it from mere humanity you bid me live
i would then rather die truly murmured $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ who on this #earth# #care# for me if he does not
who has consoled me in my sorrow but he on whom do my #hope# #rest# on whom does my bleeding #heart# repose
on him on him always on him yes you are #right# $m_maximilian_morrel$ i #will# follow you i #will# leave the paternal home i #will# give up all
oh ungrateful #girl# that i am cried $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ sobbing i #will# give up all even my dear old #grandfather# whom i had nearly forgotten
no said $m_maximilian_morrel$ you shall not leave him $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ has evinced you say a kind #feeling# towards me
as soon as we are married he shall come and live with us instead of #one# #child# he shall have two
you have told me how you talk to him and how he #answer# you i shall very soon learn that language by #sign# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and i #promise# you solemnly that instead of #despair# it is #happiness# that awaits us
oh see $m_maximilian_morrel$ see the #power# you have over me you almost make me believe you and yet what you tell me is madness for my #father# #will# curse me
well before you leave tell him all his consent would be your justification in god #sight# he is inflexible
now listen to me $m_maximilian_morrel$ if by artifice by entreaty by accident in short if by any #mean# i can delay this #marriage# #will# you wait
yes i #promise# you as faithfully as you have promised me that this horrible #marriage# shall not take #place# and that if you are dragged before a #magistrate# or a #priest# you #will# refuse
he #will# never pardon me i #promise# you by all that is most sacred to me in the #world# namely by my #mother#
yes we #will# wait replied $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ who revived at these #word# there are so many #thing# which may save unhappy beings such as we are
all you do #will# be well done only if they disregard your prayers if your #father# and $madame_de_saint_méran$ insist that $m_franz_d_épinay$ should be called #tomorrow# to #sign# the contract
we #will# wait then said $m_maximilian_morrel$ i rely on you $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said $m_maximilian_morrel$ then you have my #promise# $m_maximilian_morrel$
i #will# go to you and we #will# fly but from this #moment# until then let us not tempt providence let us not see each #other#
instead of signing it is a miracle it is a providence that we have not been discovered
if we were surprised if it were known that we met thus we should have no further resource you are #right# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ but how shall i ascertain
from the #notary# deschamps i know him and for myself i #will# write to you depend on me
i dread this #marriage# $m_maximilian_morrel$ as much as you #thank# you my adored $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #thank# you that is enough
when once i know the #hour# i #will# hasten to this #spot# you can easily get over this fence with my assistance a #carriage# #will# await us at the #gate# in which you #will# accompany me to my sister there living retired or mingling in society as you #wish# we shall be enabled to #use# our #power# to resist oppression and not suffer ourselves to be put to #death# like sheep which only defend themselves by sighs
i #will# now acknowledge you are #right# $m_maximilian_morrel$ and now are you satisfied with your betrothal said the young #girl# sorrowfully
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had approached or rather had placed her #lip# so near the fence that they nearly touched those of $m_maximilian_morrel$ which were pressed against the #other# #side# of the cold and inexorable barrier
yes said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ my adored $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #word# cannot express #one# #half# of my satisfaction adieu then till we meet again said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ tearing herself away
i shall hear from you yes #thank# #thank# dear #love# adieu the #sound# of a kiss was heard and $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ fled through the avenue
$m_maximilian_morrel$ listened to catch the last #sound# of her dress brushing the branches and of her footstep on the gravel then raised his #eye# with an ineffable #smile# of thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved and then also disappeared
it was only on the following #day# at about ten clock in the #morning# as he was starting to call on deschamps the #notary# that he received from the postman a small billet which he knew to be from $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ although he had not before seen her writing
the young #man# returned home and waited all the #evening# and all the next #day# without getting any message it was to this #effect#
#tear# entreaties prayers have availed me #nothing# #yesterday# for two #hour# i was at the church of saint philippe du roule and for two #hour# i prayed most fervently
i have but #one# #promise# and but #one# #heart# to give that #promise# is pledged to you that #heart# is also yours
heaven is as inflexible as #man# and the signature of the contract is fixed for this #evening# at nine clock this #evening# then at a #quarter# to nine at the #gate#
your betrothed $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ s my poor grandmother gets worse and worse #yesterday# her fever amounted to delirium #today# her delirium is almost madness
you #will# be very kind to me #will# you not $m_maximilian_morrel$ to make me forget my sorrow in leaving her thus
i think it is kept a #secret# from grandpapa $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ that the contract is to be signed this #evening# $m_maximilian_morrel$ went also to the #notary# who confirmed the news that the contract was to be signed that #evening#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ had been to announce the ceremony and #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had also written to beg the #count# to excuse her not inviting him the #death# of de $madame_de_saint_méran$ and the dangerous illness of his widow would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be shared by the #count# whom she wished every #happiness#
the #day# before $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had been presented to $madame_de_saint_méran$ who had left her #bed# to receive him but had been obliged to #return# to it immediately after
then he went to call on $m_de_monte_cristo$ and heard still more it is easy to suppose that $m_maximilian_morrel$ agitation would not escape the #count# penetrating #eye#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ was more affectionate than ever indeed his #manner# was so kind that several #time# $m_maximilian_morrel$ was on the #point# of telling him all
but he recalled the #promise# he had made to $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and kept his #secret# the young #man# read $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #letter# twenty #time# in the #course# of the #day#
it was her first and on what an occasion each #time# he read it he renewed his vow to make her happy
how great is the #power# of a #woman# who has made so courageous a resolution what devotion does she deserve from him for whom she has sacrificed #everything#
how ought she really to be supremely loved she becomes at once a queen and a #wife# and it is impossible to #thank# and #love# her sufficiently
$m_maximilian_morrel$ longed intensely for the #moment# when he should hear $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ say here i am $m_maximilian_morrel$ come and help me
he had arranged #everything# for her escape two ladders were hidden in the clover field a cabriolet was ordered for $m_maximilian_morrel$ alone without a #servant# without #light# at the turning of the first #street# they would #light# the lamps as it would be foolish to attract the notice of the #police# by too many precautions
occasionally he shuddered he #thought# of the #moment# when from the top of that #wall# he should protect the descent of his dear $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ pressing in his #arm# for the first #time# her of whom he had yet only kissed the delicate #hand#
when the afternoon arrived and he felt that the #hour# was #drawing# near he wished for solitude his agitation was extreme a simple #question# from a #friend# would have irritated him
he shut himself in his #room# and tried to read but his #eye# glanced over the page without understanding a #word# and he threw away the book and for the second #time# sat down to sketch his #plan# the ladders and the fence
at #length# the #hour# drew near never did a #man# deeply in #love# allow the clocks to go on peacefully
it is #time# to start the signature was indeed fixed to take #place# at nine clock but perhaps $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #will# not wait for that
consequently $m_maximilian_morrel$ having left the rue meslay at #half# past eight by his timepiece entered the clover field while the clock of saint philippe du roule was striking eight
$m_maximilian_morrel$ tormented his so effectually that they struck eight at #half# past six he then said the #horse# and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin where $m_maximilian_morrel$ had often waited
then $m_maximilian_morrel$ came out from his hiding #place# with a beating #heart# and looked through the small #opening# in the #gate# there was yet no #one# to be seen
the clock struck #half# past eight and still another #half# #hour# was passed in waiting while $m_maximilian_morrel$ walked to and fro and gazed more and more frequently through the #opening#
the #garden# became darker still but in the #darkness# he looked in vain for the white dress and in the #silence# he vainly listened for the #sound# of footsteps
the $house_of_peers$ which was discernible through the #tree# remained in #darkness# and gave no indication that so important an #event# as the signature of a #marriage# contract was going on
$m_maximilian_morrel$ looked at his watch which wanted a #quarter# to ten but soon the same clock he had already heard strike
the #night# gradually drew on and the foliage in the #garden# assumed a deeper hue two or three #time# rectified the error by striking #half# past nine
this was already #half# an #hour# past the #time# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had fixed it was a terrible #moment# for the young #man#
the slightest rustling of the foliage the least whistling of the wind attracted his #attention# and drew the perspiration to his #brow# then he tremblingly fixed his ladder and not to lose a #moment# placed his #foot# on the first #step#
amidst all these alternations of #hope# and #fear# the clock struck ten it is impossible said $m_maximilian_morrel$ that the signing of a contract should occupy so long a #time# without unexpected interruptions
i have weighed all the #chance# calculated the #time# required for all the forms #something# must have happened and then he walked rapidly to and fro and pressed his burning #forehead# against the fence
had $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ fainted or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight these were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young #man#
the #idea# that her #strength# had failed her in attempting to escape and that she had fainted in #one# of the paths was the #one# that most impressed itself upon his #mind#
in that #case# said he i should lose her and by my own fault he dwelt on this #idea# for a #moment# then it appeared reality
he even #thought# he could perceive #something# on the #ground# at a #distance# he ventured to call and it seemed to him that the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh
it was impossible to wait longer his temples throbbed violently his #eye# were growing dim he passed #one# leg over the #wall# and in a #moment# leaped down on the #other# #side#
at last the #half# #hour# struck he was on $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ premises had arrived there by scaling the #wall# what might be the consequences
however he had not ventured thus far to draw back he followed a short #distance# close under the #wall# then crossed a path hid entered a clump of #tree#
in a #moment# he had passed through them and could see the $house_of_peers$ distinctly then $m_maximilian_morrel$ saw that he had been #right# in believing that the $house_of_peers$ was not illuminated
instead of #light# at every #window# as is customary on #day# of ceremony he saw only a gray mass which was veiled also by a cloud which at that #moment# obscured the moon feeble #light#
a #light# moved rapidly from #time# to #time# past three #window# of the second #floor# these three #window# were in $madame_de_saint_méran$ #room#
so many #time# in #order# to follow $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ in #thought# at every #hour# in the #day# had he made her describe the whole $house_of_peers$ that without having seen it he knew it all
another remained motionless behind some red curtains which were in #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ bedroom $m_maximilian_morrel$ guessed all this this #darkness# and #silence# alarmed $m_maximilian_morrel$ still more than $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ absence had done
almost mad with #grief# and determined to venture #everything# in #order# to see $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ once more and be certain of the #misfortune# he feared $m_maximilian_morrel$ gained the edge of the clump of #tree# and was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower #garden# when the #sound# of a #voice# still at some #distance# but which was borne upon the wind reached him
at this #sound# as he was already partially exposed to view he stepped back and concealed himself completely remaining perfectly motionless
he had formed his resolution if it was $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ alone he would speak as she passed if she was accompanied and he could not speak
still he should see her and know that she was safe if they were #stranger# he would listen to their #conversation# and might understand #something# of this hitherto incomprehensible mystery
the moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it and $m_maximilian_morrel$ saw $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ come out upon the #step# followed by a #gentleman# in black
the young #man# seeing them approach drew back mechanically until he found himself stopped by a sycamore #tree# in the centre of the clump there he was compelled to remain
they descended and advanced towards the clump of #tree# and $m_maximilian_morrel$ soon recognized the #other# #gentleman# as #doctor# avrigny soon the two #gentleman# stopped also
ah my dear #doctor# said the #procureur# heaven declares itself against my $house_of_peers$ what a dreadful #death# what a blow
seek not to console me alas #nothing# can alleviate so great a sorrow the wound is too deep and too fresh
dead dead the cold sweat sprang to the young #man# #brow# and his teeth chattered who could be dead in that $house_of_peers$ which $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ himself had called accursed
my dear $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ replied the #doctor# with a #tone# which redoubled the #terror# of the young #man#
i have not led you here to console you on the #contrary# what can you #mean# asked the #procureur# alarmed
i #mean# that behind the #misfortune# which has just happened to you there is another perhaps still greater
can it be possible murmured $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ clasping his #hand# what are you going to tell me are we quite alone my #friend#
yes quite but why all these precautions because i have a terrible #secret# to communicate to you said the #doctor#
let us sit down $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ fell rather than seated himself the #doctor# stood before him with #one# #hand# placed on his #shoulder#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ horrified supported his #head# with #one# #hand# and with the #other# pressed his #heart# lest its beatings should be heard
dead dead repeated he within himself and he felt as if he were also dying speak #doctor# i am listening said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
strike i am prepared for #everything# $madame_de_saint_méran$ was doubtless advancing in #year# but she enjoyed excellent health
$m_maximilian_morrel$ began again to breathe freely which he had not done during the last ten #minute# #grief# has consumed her said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ yes #grief# #doctor#
it is not #grief# my dear $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ said the #doctor# #grief# may kill although it rarely does and never in a #day# never in an #hour# never in ten #minute#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ answered #nothing# he simply raised his #head# which had been cast down before and looked at the #doctor# with amazement
after living forty #year# with the marquis were you present during the last struggle asked $m_d_avrigny$ i was replied the #procureur# you begged me not to leave
did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which $madame_de_saint_méran$ has fallen a victim i did
when you arrived $madame_de_saint_méran$ had already been panting for breath some #minute# she then had a fit which i took to be simply a nervous attack and it was only when i saw her raise herself in the #bed# and her limbs and neck appear stiffened that i became really alarmed
$madame_de_saint_méran$ had three successive attacks at intervals of some #minute# each #one# more serious than the former then i understood from your #countenance# there was more to #fear# than i had #thought#
this crisis past i endeavored to catch your #eye# but could not you held her #hand# you were #feeling# her pulse and the second fit came on before you had turned towards me
this was more terrible than the first the same nervous movements were repeated and the mouth contracted and turned purple
and at the third she expired at the #end# of the first attack i discovered symptoms of tetanus you confirmed my #opinion#
yes before #other# replied the #doctor# but now we are alone what are you going to say
oh spare me that the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances are the same $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ started from his #seat# then in a #moment# fell down again silent and motionless
i know the full importance of the statement i have just made and the disposition of the #man# to whom i have made it
$m_maximilian_morrel$ knew not if he were dreaming or awake listen said the #doctor# do you speak to me as a #magistrate# or as a #friend#
the similarity in the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so great that were i obliged to affirm by oath what i have now stated i should hesitate i therefore repeat to you i speak not to a #magistrate# but to a #friend#
asked $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ as a #friend# and only as a #friend# at this #moment# and to that #friend# i say
during the three #quarter# of an #hour# that the struggle continued i watched the convulsions and the #death# of $madame_de_saint_méran$ and am thoroughly convinced that not only did her #death# proceed from #poison# but i could also specify the #poison#
can it be possible the symptoms are marked do you see sleep broken by nervous spasms excitation of the brain torpor of the nerve centres
$madame_de_saint_méran$ succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine which by some mistake perhaps has been given to her
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ seized the #doctor# #hand# oh it is impossible said he i must be dreaming it is frightful to hear such #thing# from such a #man# as you
tell me i entreat you my dear #doctor# that you may be deceived doubtless i may but but m
but i do not think so have #pity# on me #doctor# so many dreadful #thing# have happened to me lately that i am on the verge of madness
has #anyone# besides me seen $madame_de_saint_méran$ no has #anything# been sent for from a chemist that i have not examined
#nothing# had $madame_de_saint_méran$ any #enemy# not to my knowledge would her #death# affect #anyone# #interest#
oh if such a #thought# could present itself i would stab myself to punish my #heart# for having for #one# #instant# harbored it
it could not indeed my #daughter# is her only heiress $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ alone indeed my dear #friend# said $m_d_avrigny$
whether accident or mistake the #fact# is there it is on my conscience and compels me to speak aloud to you
i would not accuse #anyone# i speak only of an accident you understand of a mistake but make inquiry of whom how of what
may not $barrois$ the old #servant# have made a mistake and have given $madame_de_saint_méran$ a dose prepared for his #master#
for my #father# yes but how could a dose prepared for $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #poison# $madame_de_saint_méran$
for instance having tried every #other# remedy to restore movement and speech to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i resolved to try #one# last #mean# and for three #month# i have been giving him brucine so that in the last dose i ordered for him there were six grains
this quantity which is perfectly safe to administer to the paralyzed frame of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ which has become gradually accustomed to it would be sufficient to kill another #person#
#nothing# is more simple you know #poison# become remedies in certain diseases of which paralysis is #one#
my dear #doctor# there is no communication between $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #apartment# and that of $madame_de_saint_méran$ and $barrois$ never entered my #mother# in #law# #room#
although i #place# the utmost reliance in you i want notwithstanding my conviction to believe this axiom errare humanum est
in short #doctor# although i know you to be the most conscientious #man# in the #world# and is there #one# of my #brother# in whom you have equal confidence with myself
why do you ask me that what do you #wish# send for him i #will# tell him what i have seen and we #will# consult together and examine the #body#
and you #will# find traces of #poison# no i did not say of #poison# but we can prove what was the state of the #body#
we shall discover the cause of her sudden #death# and we shall say dear $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ if this #thing# has been caused by negligence watch over your #servant# if from hatred watch your #enemy#
what do you propose to me avrigny said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in #despair# so soon as another is admitted into our #secret# an inquest #will# become necessary and an inquest in my $house_of_peers$ impossible
still continued the #procureur# looking at the #doctor# with uneasiness if you #wish# it if you demand it why then it shall be done
but #doctor# you see me already so grieved how can i introduce into my $house_of_peers$ so much scandal after so much sorrow
my #wife# and my #daughter# would die of it and i #doctor# you know a #man# does not arrive at the post i occupy
let this #affair# be talked of it #will# be a triumph for them which #will# make them rejoice and cover me with shame
pardon me #doctor# these worldly #idea# were you a #priest# i should not dare tell you that but you are a #man# and you know mankind
#one# has not been #king# attorney twenty five #year# without having amassed a tolerable number of #enemy# mine are numerous #doctor# pray recall your #word# you have said #nothing# have you
i would have saved $madame_de_saint_méran$ if science could have done it but she is dead and my #duty# regards the living
let us bury this terrible #secret# in the deepest recesses of our #heart# i am willing if #anyone# should suspect this that my #silence# on the #subject# should be imputed to my ignorance
my dear $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ replied the #doctor# my first #duty# is to humanity meanwhile #sir# watch always watch carefully for perhaps the evil may not stop here
and when you have found the culprit if you find him i #will# say to you you are a #magistrate# do as you #will#
i #thank# you #doctor# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with indescribable #joy# i never had a better #friend# than you
when they were gone $m_maximilian_morrel$ ventured out from under the #tree# and the moon shone upon his #face# which was so pale it might have been taken for that of a ghost
and as if he feared #doctor# avrigny would recall his #promise# he hurried him towards the $house_of_peers$ i am manifestly protected in a most wonderful but most terrible #manner# said he
but $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ poor #girl# how #will# she bear so much sorrow as he #thought# thus he looked alternately at the #window# with red curtains and the three #window# with white curtains
the #light# had almost disappeared from the former doubtless #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had just put out her lamp and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull #light# on the #window#
a wax #light# placed on the mantle #piece# threw some of its pale rays without and a #shadow# was seen for #one# #moment# on the balcony
at the extremity of the building on the #contrary# he saw #one# of the three #window# open $m_maximilian_morrel$ shuddered he #thought# he heard a sob
it cannot be wondered at that his #mind# generally so courageous but now disturbed by the two strongest human passions #love# and #fear# was weakened even to the indulgence of superstitious #thought#
although it was impossible that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ should see him hidden as he was he #thought# he heard the #shadow# at the #window# call him his disturbed #mind# told him so
this double error became an irresistible reality and by #one# of the incomprehensible transports of youth he bounded from his hiding #place# and with two strides at the risk of being seen at the risk of alarming $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ at the risk of being discovered by some exclamation which might escape the young #girl# he crossed the flower #garden# which by the #light# of the moon resembled a large white lake and having passed the rows of orange #tree# which extended in front of the $house_of_peers$ he reached the #step# ran quickly up and pushed the #door# which opened without offering any resistance
her #eye# raised towards heaven were watching a silvery cloud gliding over the azure its form that of a #shadow# mounting towards heaven
meanwhile $m_maximilian_morrel$ had traversed the anteroom and found the #staircase# which being carpeted prevented his approach being heard and he had regained that degree of confidence
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had not seen him her poetic and excited #mind# pictured it as the soul of her grandmother that the #presence# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ even would not have alarmed him
he would at once approach $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #father# and acknowledge all begging $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ to pardon and sanction the #love# which united two fond and loving #heart#
now especially did he find the description $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had given of the interior of the $house_of_peers$ useful to him he arrived safely at the top of the #staircase# and while he was #feeling# his #way# a sob indicated the direction he was to take
he turned back a #door# partly open enabled him to see his #road# and to hear the #voice# of #one# in sorrow
he was quite prepared for any such encounter $m_maximilian_morrel$ was mad happily he did not meet #anyone# he pushed the #door# open and entered
at the #other# #end# of the #room# under a white sheet which covered it lay the corpse still more alarming to $m_maximilian_morrel$ since the #account# he had so unexpectedly overheard
by its #side# on her knees and with her #head# buried in the cushion of an easy #chair# was $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ trembling and sobbing her #hand# extended above her #head# clasped and stiff
she had turned from the #window# which remained open and was praying in accents that would have affected the most unfeeling her #word# were rapid incoherent unintelligible for the burning weight of #grief# almost stopped her utterance
the moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn paler and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole #scene#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ could not resist this he was not exemplary for piety he was not easily impressed but $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ suffering weeping wringing her #hand# before him was more than he could bear in #silence#
he sighed and whispered a #name# and the #head# bathed in #tear# and pressed on the velvet cushion of the #chair# a #head# like that of a magdalen by correggio was raised and turned towards him
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ perceived him without betraying the least surprise a #heart# overwhelmed with #one# great #grief# is insensible to minor #emotion# $m_maximilian_morrel$ held out his #hand# to her
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ as her only apology for not having met him pointed to the corpse under the sheet and began to sob again
neither dared for some #time# to speak in that #room# they hesitated to break the #silence# which #death# seemed to impose at #length# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ ventured
my #friend# said she how came you here alas i would say you are welcome had not #death# opened the #way# for you into this $house_of_peers$
i became uneasy leaped the #wall# found my #way# through the #garden# when #voice# conversing about the fatal #event#
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said $m_maximilian_morrel$ with a trembling #voice# i had waited since #half# past eight and did not see you come what #voice#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ shuddered as he #thought# of the #conversation# of the #doctor# and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and he #thought# he could see through the sheet the extended #hand# the stiff neck and the purple #lip#
asked $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ your #servant# said he who were repeating the whole of the sorrowful #story# from them i learned it all
but it was risking the failure of our #plan# to come up here #love# forgive me replied $m_maximilian_morrel$
i #will# go away no said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ you might meet someone stay but if #anyone# should come here the young #girl# shook her #head#
no #one# #will# come said she do not #fear# there is our safeguard pointing to the #bed# but what has become of $m_franz_d_épinay$
alas said $m_maximilian_morrel$ with a #feeling# of selfish #joy# for he #thought# this #death# would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely
replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ $m_franz_de_quesnel$ arrived to #sign# the contract just as my dear grandmother was dying
but what redoubles my sorrow continued the young #girl# as if this #feeling# was to receive its immediate punishment is that the poor old #lady# on her #death# #bed# requested that the #marriage# might take #place# as soon as possible she also thinking to protect me was acting against me
hark said $m_maximilian_morrel$ they both listened #step# were distinctly heard in the corridor and on the stairs it is my #father# who has just left his #study#
to accompany the #doctor# to the #door# added $m_maximilian_morrel$ how do you know it is the #doctor# asked $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ astonished
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ looked at the young #man# they heard the #street# #door# close then $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ locked the #garden# #door# and returned upstairs
he stopped a #moment# in the anteroom as if hesitating whether to #turn# to his own #apartment# or into $madame_de_saint_méran$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ concealed himself behind a #door# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ remained motionless #grief# seeming to deprive her of all #fear#
i imagined it must be said $m_maximilian_morrel$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ passed on to his own #room# now said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ you can neither go out by the front #door# nor by the #garden#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ looked at her with #astonishment# there is but #one# #way# left you that is safe said she
it is through my #grandfather# #room# she rose come she added where asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ to my #grandfather# #room#
i in $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #apartment# yes can you #mean# it $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ i have long wished it he is my only remaining #friend#
and we both need his help come be careful $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said $m_maximilian_morrel$ hesitating to comply with the young #girl# #wish#
i now see my error i acted like a madman in coming in here are you sure you are more reasonable
yes said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and i have but #one# scruple that of leaving my dear grandmother remains which i had undertaken to watch
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said $m_maximilian_morrel$ #death# is in itself sacred yes said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ besides it #will# not be for long
she then crossed the corridor and led the #way# down a narrow #staircase# to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #room# $m_maximilian_morrel$ followed her on tiptoe at the #door# they found the old #servant#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ seated in his #chair# and listening to every #sound# was watching the #door# he saw $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and his #eye# brightened
there was #something# grave and solemn in the approach of the young #girl# which struck the old #man# and immediately his bright #eye# began to interrogate
$barrois$ said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ shut the #door# and let no #one# come in she passed first dear #grandfather#
said she hurriedly you know poor grandmamma died an #hour# since and now i have no #friend# in the #world# but you
his expressive #eye# evinced the greatest tenderness to you alone then may i confide my sorrows and my #hope#
the paralytic motioned yes $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ took $m_maximilian_morrel$ #hand# #look# attentively then at this #gentleman# the old #man# fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight #astonishment# on $m_maximilian_morrel$
it is $m_maximilian_morrel$ said she the #son# of that good merchant of marseilles whom you doubtless recollect
he brings an irreproachable #name# which $m_maximilian_morrel$ is likely to render glorious since at thirty #year# of #age# he is a #captain# an #officer# of the legion of #honor#
yes said the old #man# the old #man# signified that he recollected him well grandpapa said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ kneeling before him and pointing to $m_maximilian_morrel$
i #love# him and #will# be only his were i compelled to marry another i would destroy myself the #eye# of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous #thought#
you like $m_maximilian_morrel$ do you not grandpapa asked $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ yes and you #will# protect us who are your #child# against the #will# of my #father#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ cast an intelligent #glance# at $m_maximilian_morrel$ as if to say perhaps i may $m_maximilian_morrel$ understood him
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said he you have a sacred #duty# to fulfil in your deceased grandmother #room# #will# you allow me the #honor# of a few #minute# #conversation# with $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
that is it said the old #man# #eye# then he looked anxiously at $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ do you #fear# he #will# not understand
yes oh we have so often spoken of you that he knows exactly how i talk to you
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ arose placed a #chair# for $m_maximilian_morrel$ requested $barrois$ not to admit #anyone# and having tenderly embraced her #grandfather# and sorrowfully taken leave of $m_maximilian_morrel$ she went away
to prove to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ that he was in $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ confidence and knew all their #secret# $m_maximilian_morrel$ took the dictionary a pen and some #paper# and placed them all on a #table# where there was a #light#
but first said $m_maximilian_morrel$ allow me #sir# to tell you who i am how much i #love# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and what are my designs respecting her
then turning to $m_maximilian_morrel$ with an adorable #smile# although shaded by sorrow he knows #everything# i know said she
it was an imposing #sight# to witness this old #man# apparently a mere useless burden becoming the sole protector support and adviser of the lovers who were both young beautiful and strong
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ made a #sign# that he would listen his remarkably noble and austere #expression# struck $m_maximilian_morrel$ who began his #story# with trembling
he related the #manner# in which he had become acquainted with $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and how he had loved her and that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ in her solitude and her #misfortune# had accepted the offer of his devotion
he told him his birth his #position# his #fortune# and more than once when he consulted the #look# of the paralytic that #look# answered that is good proceed
and now said $m_maximilian_morrel$ when he had finished the first #part# of his recital now i have told you of my #love# and my #hope# may i inform you of my intentions
this was our resolution a cabriolet was in waiting at the #gate# in which i intended to carry off $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ to my sister $house_of_peers$ to marry her and to wait respectfully $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ pardon
yes signified the old #man# no said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ we must not do so no
you do not sanction our project no there is another #way# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ the old #man# interrogative #eye# said
i am happy to be able to mention this in $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ absence and #will# conduct myself toward him so as to compel him to challenge me
which i #will# go continued $m_maximilian_morrel$ i #will# seek $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #look# continued to interrogate
you #wish# to know what i #will# do yes i #will# find him as i told you
i #will# tell him the ties which bind me to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ if he be a sensible #man# he #will# prove it by renouncing of his own accord the #hand# of his betrothed and #will# secure my friendship and #love# until #death# if he refuse either through #interest# or ridiculous pride after i have proved to him that he would be forcing my #wife# from me that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ loves me and #will# have no #other# i #will# fight with him give him every advantage and i shall kill him or he #will# kill me if i am victorious he #will# not marry $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and if i die i am very sure $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #will# not marry him
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ watched with indescribable #pleasure# this noble and sincere #countenance# on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted adding by the #expression# of his fine
#feature# all that coloring adds to a #sound# and faithful #drawing# still when $m_maximilian_morrel$ had finished he shut his #eye# several #time# which was his #manner# of saying
no no said $m_maximilian_morrel$ you disapprove of this second project as you did of the first
i do signified the old #man# but what then must be done asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ $madame_de_saint_méran$ last request was that the #marriage# might not be delayed must i let #thing# take their #course#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ did not move i understand said $m_maximilian_morrel$ i am to wait yes but delay may ruin our #plan# #sir# replied the young #man#
alone $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ has no #power# she #will# be compelled to submit i am here almost miraculously and can scarcely #hope# for so good an opportunity to occur again
believe me there are only the two #plan# i have proposed to you forgive my vanity and tell me which you prefer
do you authorize $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ to intrust herself to my #honor# no do you prefer i should seek $m_franz_d_épinay$
no whence then #will# come the help we need from #chance# resumed $m_maximilian_morrel$ no from you
yes you thoroughly understand me #sir# pardon my eagerness for my #life# depends on your #answer# #will# our help come from you
there was so much firmness in the #look# which gave this #answer# no #one# could at any rate #doubt# his #will# if they did his #power#
but how unless a miracle should restore your speech your gesture your movement how can you chained to that armchair dumb and motionless oppose this #marriage#
yes you are sure of it yes oh #thank# you a thousand #time#
a #smile# lit up the old #man# #face# a strange #smile# of the #eye# in a paralyzed #face# then i must wait asked the young #man#
yes but the contract the same #smile# returned #will# you assure me it shall not be signed
yes said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the contract shall not be signed cried $m_maximilian_morrel$ oh pardon me #sir# i can scarcely realize so great a #happiness#
this #promise# of an impotent old #man# was so strange that instead of being the result of the #power# of his #will# it might emanate from enfeebled organs
#will# they not #sign# it no said the paralytic notwithstanding that assurance $m_maximilian_morrel$ still hesitated is it not natural that the madman ignorant of his folly should attempt #thing# beyond his #power#
the weak #man# talks of burdens he can raise the timid of giants he can confront the poor of #treasure# he spends the most humble peasant in the height of his pride calls himself jupiter
whether $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ understood the young #man# indecision or whether he had not full confidence in his docility he looked uneasily at him
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #eye# remained fixed and firm as if to imply that a #promise# did not suffice then it passed from his #face# to his #hand#
what do you #wish# #sir# asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ that i should renew my #promise# of remaining tranquil shall
i swear to you #sir# asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ yes said the paralytic with the same solemnity $m_maximilian_morrel$ understood that the old #man# attached great importance to an oath
i swear to you on my #honor# said he to await your decision respecting the #course# i am to pursue with $m_franz_d_épinay$
he extended his #hand# that is #right# said the old #man# now said $m_maximilian_morrel$ do you #wish# me to retire
yes without seeing $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ yes $m_maximilian_morrel$ made a #sign# that he was ready to obey
but said he first allow me to embrace you as your #daughter# did just now $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #expression# could not be understood
the young #man# pressed his #lip# on the same #spot# on the old #man# #forehead# where $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had been then he bowed a second #time# and retired
$m_maximilian_morrel$ was conducted along a dark passage which led to a little #door# #opening# on the #garden# soon found the #spot# where he had entered with the assistance of the shrubs gained the top of the #wall# and by his ladder was in an #instant# in the clover field where his cabriolet was still waiting for him
he got in it and thoroughly wearied by so many #emotion# arrived about midnight in the rue meslay threw himself on his #bed# and slept soundly
he found outside the #door# the old #servant# to whom $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had given directions volume four m #chapter#
two #day# after a considerable crowd was assembled towards ten clock in the #morning# around the #door# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ $house_of_peers$ and a long file of mourning coaches and private #carriage# extended along the $faubourg_saint_honoré$ and the rue de la pépinière
the $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #family# vault among them was #one# of a very singular form which appeared to have come from a #distance#
inquiry was made and it was ascertained that by a strange coincidence this #carriage# contained the corpse of the marquis de $madame_de_saint_méran$ and that those who had come thinking to attend #one# funeral would follow two
it was a kind of covered wagon painted black and was #one# of the first to arrive their number was great
and #king# charles had preserved a great number of #friend# and these added to the personages whom the usages of society gave $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ a claim on formed a considerable #body#
due information was given to the authorities and permission obtained that the two funerals should take #place# at the same #time#
a second hearse decked with the same funereal pomp was brought to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #door# and the coffin removed into it from the post wagon
the two #body# were to be interred in the cemetery of père lachaise where $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his #family#
the remains of poor $renée$ were already deposited there and now after ten #year# of separation her #father# and #mother# were to be reunited with her
the parisians always curious always affected by funereal display looked on with religious #silence# while the splendid procession accompanied to their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracy the greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles
the marquis de $madame_de_saint_méran$ #one# of the most zealous and faithful dignitaries of $louis_xviii$ in #one# of the mourning coaches $m_beauchamp$ $m_lucien_debray$ and $baron_de_château_renaud$ were talking of the very sudden #death# of the marchioness
i saw $madame_de_saint_méran$ only last #year# at marseilles when i was coming back from algiers said $baron_de_château_renaud$
she looked like a #woman# destined to live to be a hundred #year# old from her apparent #sound# health and great activity of #mind# and #body#
but she has not died of old #age# but of #grief# it appears that since the #death# of the marquis which affected her very deeply she has not completely recovered her #reason#
how old was she $m_franz_de_quesnel$ assured me replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ that she was sixty six #year# old but of what disease then did she die asked $m_lucien_debray$
it is said to have been a congestion of the brain or apoplexy which is the same #thing# is it not
$madame_de_saint_méran$ whom i once saw was short of slender form and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament #grief# could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of $madame_de_saint_méran$
nearly it is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy said $m_beauchamp$ at any rate said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
whatever disease or #doctor# may have killed her $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ or rather $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ or still rather our #friend# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ inherits a magnificent #fortune# amounting i believe to livres per annum
and this #fortune# #will# be doubled at the #death# of the old jacobin $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ that is a tenacious old #grandfather# said $m_beauchamp$
i think he must have made an agreement with #death# to outlive all his heirs and he appears likely to succeed
tenacem propositi virum he resembles the old conventionalist of who said to $napoleon$ in you bend because your empire is a young stem weakened by rapid growth
take the republic for a tutor let us #return# with renewed #strength# to the battle field and i #promise# you #soldier# another marengo and a second austerlitz
#idea# do not become extinct sire they slumber sometimes but only revive the stronger before they sleep entirely #idea# and #man# appeared the same to him said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
#one# #thing# only puzzles me namely how $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay #will# like a #grandfather# who cannot be separated from his #wife#
but where is $m_franz_de_quesnel$ in the first #carriage# with $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who considers him already as #one# of the #family#
such was the #conversation# in almost all the #carriage# these two sudden #death# so quickly following each #other# astonished #everyone# but no #one# suspected the terrible #secret# which $m_d_avrigny$ had communicated in his nocturnal walk to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
they arrived in about an #hour# at the cemetery the weather was mild but dull and in harmony with the funeral ceremony
among the groups which flocked towards the #family# vault $baron_de_château_renaud$ recognized $m_maximilian_morrel$ who had come alone in a cabriolet and walked silently along the path bordered with yew #tree#
you here said $baron_de_château_renaud$ passing his #arm# through the young #captain# are you a #friend# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
how is it that i have never met you at his $house_of_peers$ i am no acquaintance of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ answered $m_maximilian_morrel$ but i was of $madame_de_saint_méran$
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ came up to them at this #moment# with $m_franz_de_quesnel$ the #time# and #place# are but ill suited for an introduction said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
$m_maximilian_morrel$ allow me to present to you $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay a delightful travelling #companion# with whom i made the tour of italy
my dear $m_franz_de_quesnel$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ an excellent #friend# i have acquired in your absence and whose #name# you #will# hear me mention every #time# i make any allusion to affection wit or amiability
$m_maximilian_morrel$ hesitated for a #moment# he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a friendly #manner# the #man# whom he was tacitly opposing but his oath and the gravity of the #circumstance# recurred to his memory he struggled to conceal his #emotion# and bowed to $m_franz_de_quesnel$
but we are not superstitious $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ is in deep sorrow is she not said $m_lucien_debray$ to $m_franz_de_quesnel$
extremely replied he she looked so pale this #morning# i scarcely knew her these apparently simple #word# pierced $m_maximilian_morrel$ to the #heart#
this #man# had seen $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and spoken to her the young and high spirited #officer# required all his #strength# of #mind# to resist breaking his oath
he took the #arm# of $baron_de_château_renaud$ and turned towards the vault where the attendants had already placed the two coffins
this is a magnificent habitation said $m_beauchamp$ looking towards the mausoleum a summer and winter palace you #will# in #turn# enter it my dear épinay for you #will# soon be numbered as #one# of the #family#
i as a philosopher should like a little #country# $house_of_peers$ a cottage down there under the #tree# without so many free #stone# over my poor #body#
in dying i #will# say to those around me what voltaire wrote to piron eo rus and all #will# be over
but come $m_franz_de_quesnel$ take courage your #wife# is an heiress indeed $m_beauchamp$ you are unbearable politics has made you laugh at #everything# and political #man# have made you disbelieve #everything#
but when you have the #honor# of associating with ordinary #man# and the #pleasure# of leaving politics for a #moment# try to find your affectionate #heart# which you leave with your stick when you go to the #chamber#
i am prejudiced against $m_beauchamp$ said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #drawing# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ away and leaving the former to finish his philosophical dissertation with $m_lucien_debray$
the $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ vault formed a square of white #stone# about twenty #foot# high an interior partition separated the two #family# and each #apartment# had its entrance #door#
here were not as in #other# tombs ignoble drawers #one# above another where thrift bestows its dead and labels them like specimens in a museum all that was visible within the bronze #gate# was a gloomy looking #room# separated by a #wall# from the vault itself
but tell me said $m_beauchamp$ what is #life# is it not a halt in #death# anteroom the two #door# before mentioned were in the middle of this #wall# and enclosed the $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and $madame_de_saint_méran$ coffins
there #grief# might freely expend itself without being disturbed by the trifling loungers who came from a picnic party to #visit# père lachaise or by lovers who make it their rendezvous
the two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their reception in the #right# #hand# crypt belonging to the $madame_de_saint_méran$ #family#
as the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the #door# and there was no address given the party all separated $baron_de_château_renaud$ $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and $m_maximilian_morrel$ went #one# #way# and $m_lucien_debray$ and $m_beauchamp$ the #other#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ remained with $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ at the #gate# of the cemetery $m_maximilian_morrel$ made an excuse to wait he saw $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ get into the same mourning coach and #thought# this meeting forboded evil
he then returned to paris and although in the same #carriage# with $baron_de_château_renaud$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he did not hear #one# #word# of their #conversation#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary as $m_franz_de_quesnel$ was about to take leave of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ when shall i see you again said the latter
at what #time# you please #sir# replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ as soon as possible i am at your command #sir# shall we #return# together
if not unpleasant to you on the #contrary# i shall feel much #pleasure# thus the future #father# and #son# in #law# stepped into the same #carriage# and $m_maximilian_morrel$ seeing them pass became uneasy
the #procureur# without going to see either his #wife# or his #daughter# went at once to his #study# and offering the young #man# a #chair#
$m_franz_d_épinay$ said he allow me to remind you at this #moment# which is perhaps not so ill chosen as at first #sight# may appear for obedience to the #wish# of the departed is the first offering which should be made at their tomb allow me then to remind you of the #wish# expressed by $madame_de_saint_méran$ on her #death# #bed# that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ wedding might not be deferred

you may call on the #notary# deschamps #place# beauveau $faubourg_saint_honoré$ and you have my authority to inspect those deeds
it is not perhaps the #moment# for $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ who is in deep distress to think of a #husband# indeed i #fear# m
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #will# have no greater #pleasure# than that of fulfilling her grandmother last injunctions there #will# be no obstacle from that #quarter# i assure you
in that #case# replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ as i shall raise none you may make arrangements when you please i have pledged my #word# and shall feel #pleasure# and #happiness# in adhering to it
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and $m_franz_de_quesnel$ returned to the $faubourg_saint_honoré$ #sir# replied $m_franz_d_épinay$ then said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #nothing# further is required
the contract was to have been signed three #day# since we shall find it all ready and can #sign# it #today#
but the mourning said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ hesitating dont be uneasy on that score replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ no ceremony #will# be neglected in my $house_of_peers$
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ may retire during the prescribed three #month# to her estate of $madame_de_saint_méran$ i say hers for she inherits it #today#

when that is over you #sir# can #return# to paris while your #wife# passes the #time# of her mourning with her #mother# in #law#
as you please #sir# said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ then replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ have the kindness to wait #half# an #hour# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ shall come down into the #drawing# #room#
i #will# send for deschamps we #will# read and #sign# the contract before we separate and this #evening# #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ shall accompany $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ to her estate where we #will# rejoin them in a week
i #wish# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and raoul de $baron_de_château_renaud$ to be present at this signature you know they are my witnesses
#sir# said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ i have #one# request to make what is it #half# an #hour# #will# suffice to apprise them #will# you go for them yourself or shall you send
i prefer going #sir# i shall expect you then in #half# an #hour# #baron# and $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #will# be ready
scarcely had the #door# closed when $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ sent to tell $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ to be ready in the #drawing# #room# in #half# an #hour# as he expected the #notary# and $m_franz_d_épinay$ and his witnesses
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ bowed and left the #room# the news caused a great sensation throughout the $house_of_peers$ #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ would not believe it and $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was thunderstruck
she looked around for help and would have gone down to her #grandfather# #room# but on the stairs she met $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who took her #arm# and led her into the #drawing# #room#
in the anteroom $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ met $barrois$ and looked despairingly at the old #servant# a #moment# later #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ entered the #drawing# #room# with her little $edward$
she sat down took $edward$ on her knees and from #time# to #time# pressed this #child# on whom her affections appeared centred almost convulsively to her bosom
it was evident that she had shared the #grief# of the #family# for she was pale and looked fatigued two #carriage# were soon heard to enter the courtyard
#one# was the #notary# the #other# that of $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and his #friend# in a #moment# the whole party was assembled $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was so pale #one# might trace the blue veins from her temples round her #eye# and down her cheeks
$baron_de_château_renaud$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ looked at each #other# with amazement the ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful than did that which was about to begin
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had placed herself in the #shadow# behind a velvet curtain and as she constantly bent over her #child# it was difficult to read the #expression# of her #face#
the #notary# after having according to the customary method arranged the #paper# on the #table# taken his #place# in an armchair and raised his spectacles turned towards $m_franz_de_quesnel$
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ was deeply affected $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was as usual unmoved are you $m_franz_de_quesnel$ $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #baron# épinay asked he although he knew it perfectly
i have then to inform you #sir# at the request of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ that your projected #marriage# with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ has changed the #feeling# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ towards his grandchild and that he disinherits her entirely of the #fortune# he would have left her
let me hasten to add continued he that the testator having only the #right# to alienate a #part# of his #fortune# and having alienated it all the #will# will not bear scrutiny and is declared null and void
but i warn $m_franz_d_épinay$ that during my #life# #time# my #father# #will# shall never be questioned my #position# forbidding any #doubt# to be entertained
#sir# said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ i regret much that such a #question# has been raised in the #presence# of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ i have never inquired the amount of her #fortune# which however limited it may be exceeds mine
yes #sir# replied $m_franz_de_quesnel$ the #notary# bowed yes said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ my #family# has sought consideration in this alliance with $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ all i seek is #happiness#
besides #sir# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ addressing himself to his future #son# in #law# excepting the loss of a portion of your #hope# this unexpected #will# need not personally wound you $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ weakness of #mind# sufficiently explains it
it is not because $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ is going to marry you that he is angry but because she #will# marry a union with any #other# would have caused him the same sorrow
old #age# is selfish #sir# and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ has been a faithful #companion# to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ which she cannot be when she becomes the #baroness# épinay
my #father# melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any #subject# which the weakness of his #mind# would incapacitate him from understanding and i am perfectly convinced that at the present #time# although he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ has even forgotten the #name# of his intended grandson
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ imperceptibly thanked him while two silent #tear# rolled down her cheeks $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had scarcely said this when the #door# opened and $barrois$ appeared
#gentleman# said he in a #tone# strangely firm for a #servant# speaking to his #master# under such solemn #circumstance# #gentleman# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #wish# to speak immediately to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #baron# épinay
he as well as the #notary# that there might be no mistake in the #person# gave all his titles to the bridegroom elect
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ started #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ let her #son# slip from her knees $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ rose pale and dumb as a statue
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ and $baron_de_château_renaud$ exchanged a second #look# more full of amazement than the first the #notary# looked at $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ it is impossible said the #procureur#
it is at this #moment# replied $barrois$ with the same firmness that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ my #master# #wish# to speak on important #subject# to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay
$m_franz_d_épinay$ cannot leave the #drawing# #room# at present grandpapa $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ can speak now then said $edward$ with his habitual quickness
however his remark did not make #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ even #smile# so much was every #mind# engaged and so solemn was the situation
then nortier gives notice to these #gentleman# replied $barrois$ that he #will# give #order# to be carried to the #drawing# #room#
tell nortier resumed $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ that what he demands is impossible #astonishment# was at its height #something# like a #smile# was perceptible on #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #countenance#
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ instinctively raised her #eye# as if to #thank# heaven pray go $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and see what this new fancy of your #grandfather# is
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ rose quickly and was hastening joyfully towards the #door# when $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ altered his intention stop said he
excuse me #sir# said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ since $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ sent for me i am ready to attend to his #wish# besides i shall be happy to pay my respects to him not having yet had the #honor# of doing so
i #will# go with you pray #sir# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with marked uneasiness do not disturb yourself
i would not lose this opportunity of proving to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ how wrong it would be of him to encourage #feeling# of dislike to me which i am determined to conquer whatever they may be by my devotion
and without listening to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ he arose and followed $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ who was running downstairs with the #joy# of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a #rock# to cling to
forgive me #sir# said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ in a resolute #tone# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ followed them $baron_de_château_renaud$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ exchanged a third #look# of still increasing wonder
#chapter# a signed statement $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was prepared to receive them dressed in black and installed in his armchair when the three #person# he expected had entered he looked at the #door# which his #valet# immediately closed
listen whispered $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ to $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ who could not conceal her #joy# if $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #wish# to communicate #anything# which would delay your #marriage# i forbid you to understand him
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ blushed but did not #answer# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ approached $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ here is $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay said he you requested to see him
we have all wished for this interview and i trust it #will# convince you how ill formed are your objections to $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #marriage#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ answered only by a #look# which made $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #blood# run cold he motioned to $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ to approach in a #moment# #thank# to her habit of conversing with her #grandfather# she understood that he asked for a key
she opened the drawer and found a key and understanding that was what he wanted again watched his #eye# which turned toward an old secretaire which had been neglected for many #year# and was supposed to contain #nothing# but useless documents
then his #eye# was fixed on the drawer of a small chest between the #window# shall i open the secretaire asked $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
yes said the old #man# and the drawers yes those at the #side# no
the middle #one# yes $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ opened it and drew out a bundle of #paper# is that what you #wish# for asked she
no she took successively all the #other# #paper# out till the drawer was empty but there are no more said she
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #eye# was fixed on the dictionary yes i understand #grandfather# said the young #girl# she pointed to each #letter# of the alphabet
at the #letter# the old #man# stopped her she opened and found the #word# #secret# ah is there a #secret# spring said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
yes said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and who knows it $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looked at the #door# where the #servant# had gone out
$barrois$ said she yes shall i call him yes $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ went to the #door# and called $barrois$
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ impatience during this #scene# made the perspiration roll from his #forehead# and $m_franz_de_quesnel$ was stupefied the old #servant# came
my #grandfather# has told me to open that drawer in the secretaire but there is a #secret# spring in it which you know #will# you open it
$barrois$ touched a spring the false bottom came out and they saw a bundle of #paper# tied with a black string
$barrois$ said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ $barrois$ looked at the old #man# obey said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ intelligent #eye# is that what you #wish# for said $barrois$
yes shall i give these #paper# to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ no to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ no
to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay yes $m_franz_de_quesnel$ astonished advanced a #step# to me #sir# said he yes
to be given after my #death# to general durand who shall bequeath the packet to his #son# with an injunction to preserve it as containing an important document
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ took them from $barrois$ and casting a #glance# at the cover read well #sir# asked $m_franz_de_quesnel$ what do you #wish# me to do with this #paper#
to preserve it sealed up as it is doubtless said the #procureur# no replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ eagerly do you #wish# him to read it said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
yes replied the old #man# you understand #baron# my #grandfather# #wish# you to read this #paper# said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
then let us sit down said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ impatiently for it #will# take some #time# sit down said the old #man#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ took a #chair# but $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ remained standing by her #father# #side# and $m_franz_de_quesnel$ before him holding the mysterious #paper# in his #hand#
read said the old #man# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ untied it and in the midst of the most profound #silence# read
extract of the report of a meeting of the bonapartist club in the rue saint jacques held february th
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ stopped february th said he it is the #day# my #father# was murdered $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ were dumb the #eye# of the old #man# alone seemed to say clearly go on
but it was on leaving this club said he my #father# disappeared $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #eye# continued to say read
the undersigned $louis_xviii$ jacques beaurepaire lieutenant colonel of artillery étienne duchampy general of brigade and claude lecharpal keeper of woods and forests declare that on the th of february a #letter# arrived from the #island# of $elba$ recommending to the kindness and the confidence of the bonapartist club general flavien $m_franz_de_quesnel$ who having served the emperor from to was supposed to be devoted to the #interest# of the $napoleon$ dynasty notwithstanding the title of #baron# which $louis_xviii$
a #note# was in consequence addressed to general $m_franz_de_quesnel$ begging him to be present at the meeting next #day# the th
the #note# indicated neither the #street# nor the number of the $house_of_peers$ where the meeting was to be held it bore no signature but it announced to the general that someone would call for him if he would be ready at nine clock
he resumed had just granted to him with his estate of épinay the meetings were always held from that #time# till midnight
at nine clock the #president# of the club presented himself the general was ready the #president# informed him that #one# of the conditions of his introduction was that he should be eternally ignorant of the #place# of meeting and that he would allow his #eye# to be bandaged swearing that he would not endeavor to take off the bandage
the general #carriage# was ready but the #president# told him it was impossible for him to #use# it since it was useless to blindfold the #master# if the coachman knew through what #street# he went
general $m_franz_de_quesnel$ accepted the condition and promised on his #honor# not to seek to discover the #road# they took
have you then so much confidence in your #servant# that you can intrust him with a #secret# you #will# not allow me to know
what must be done then asked the general i have my #carriage# here said the #president#
our coachman is a member of the club said the #president# we shall be driven by a state councillor
we insert this joke to prove that the general was not in the least compelled to attend the meeting but that he came willingly
when they were seated in the #carriage# the #president# reminded the general of his #promise# to allow his #eye# to be bandaged to which he made no opposition
on the #road# the #president# #thought# he saw the general make an attempt to remove the handkerchief and reminded him of his oath
then we run another risk said the general laughing that of being upset sure enough said the general
the general alighted leaning on the #arm# of the #president# of whose dignity he was not aware considering him simply as a member of the club they went through the alley mounted a flight of stairs and entered the assembly #room#
the #carriage# stopped at an alley leading out of the rue saint jacques the deliberations had already begun the members apprised of the #sort# of presentation which was to be made that #evening# were all in attendance
when in the middle of the #room# the general was invited to remove his bandage he did so immediately and was surprised to see so many well known #face# in a society of whose existence he had till then been ignorant
they questioned him as to his sentiments but he contented himself with answering that the #letter# from the #island# of $elba$ ought to have informed them $m_franz_de_quesnel$ interrupted himself by saying
my #father# was a royalist they need not have asked his sentiments which were well known and hence said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ arose my affection for your #father# my dear $m_franz_de_quesnel$
#opinion# held in common are a ready bond of union read again said the old #man# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ continued
the #president# then sought to make him speak more explicitly but $m_franz_de_quesnel$ replied that he wished first to know what they wanted with him
he was then informed of the contents of the #letter# from the #island# of $elba$ in which he was recommended to the club as a #man# who would be likely to advance the #interest# of their party
#one# paragraph spoke of the #return# of $bonaparte$ and promised another #letter# and further details on the arrival of the $pharaon$ belonging to the shipbuilder $m_maximilian_morrel$ of marseilles whose #captain# was entirely devoted to the emperor
during all this #time# the general on whom they #thought# to have relied as on a #brother# manifested evidently #sign# of discontent and repugnance
when the reading was finished he remained silent with knitted #brow# well asked the #president# what do you say to this #letter# general
i say that it is too soon after declaring myself for $louis_xviii$ to break my vow in behalf of the ex emperor
this #answer# was too clear to permit of any mistake as to his sentiments general said the #president#
we acknowledge no #king# $louis_xviii$ or an ex emperor but his majesty the emperor and #king# driven from france which is his kingdom by violence and treason
excuse me #gentleman# said the general you may not acknowledge $louis_xviii$ but i do as he has made me a #baron# and a field marshal and i shall never forget that for these two titles i am indebted to his happy #return# to france
#sir# said the #president# rising with gravity be careful what you say your #word# clearly show us that they are deceived concerning you in the #island# of $elba$ and have deceived us
the communication has been made to you in consequence of the confidence placed in you and which does you #honor#
we #will# not constrain you to help us we enroll no #one# against his conscience but we #will# compel you to act generously even if you are not disposed to do so
now we discover our error a title and promotion attach you to the government we #wish# to overturn
you would call acting generously knowing your conspiracy and not informing against you that is what i should call becoming your accomplice
you see i am more candid than you ah my #father# said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ interrupting himself i understand now why they murdered him
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ could not help casting #one# #glance# towards the young #man# whose filial enthusiasm it was delightful to behold $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ walked to and fro behind them
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ watched the #expression# of each #one# and preserved his dignified and commanding attitude $m_franz_de_quesnel$ returned to the manuscript and continued
#sir# said the #president# you have been invited to join this assembly you were not forced here it was proposed to you to come blindfolded
when you complied with this twofold request you well knew we did not #wish# to secure the throne of $louis_xviii$ or we should not take so much #care# to avoid the vigilance of the #police#
it would be conceding too much to allow you to put on a mask to aid you in the discovery of our #secret# and then to remove it that you may ruin those who have confided in you
no no you must first say if you declare yourself for the #king# of a #day# who now reigns or for his majesty the emperor
you accepted i am a royalist replied the general i have taken the oath of allegiance to $louis_xviii$ and i #will# adhere to it
these #word# were followed by a general murmur and it was evident that several of the members were discussing the propriety of making the general repent of his rashness
the #president# again arose and having imposed #silence# said #sir# you are too serious and too sensible a #man# not to understand the consequences of our present situation and your candor has already dictated to us the conditions which remain for us to offer you
the general putting his #hand# on his sword exclaimed if you talk of #honor# do not begin by disavowing its #law# and impose #nothing# by violence
and you #sir# continued the #president# with a calmness still more terrible than the general anger
the general looked around him with slight uneasiness however he did not yield but calling up all his fortitude said i #will# not swear
i advise you not to touch your sword then you must die replied the #president# calmly
m épinay became very pale he looked round him a second #time# several members of the club were whispering and getting their #arm# from under their cloaks
general said the #president# do not alarm yourself you are among #man# of #honor# who #will# #use# every #mean# to convince you before resorting to the last extremity but as you have said you are among conspirators you are in #possession# of our #secret# and you must restore it to us
a significant #silence# followed these #word# and as the general did not reply close the #door# said the #president# to the #door# keeper
the same deadly #silence# succeeded these #word# then the general advanced and making a violent #effort# to control his #feeling# i have a #son# said he
and i ought to think of him finding myself among assassins general said the chief of the assembly #one# #man# may insult fifty
it is the privilege of weakness but he does wrong to #use# his privilege follow my advice swear and do not insult
the general again daunted by the superiority of the chief hesitated a #moment# then advancing to the #president# desk what is the form said he
it is this i swear by my #honor# not to reveal to #anyone# what i have seen and heard on the th of february between nine and ten clock in the #evening# and i plead guilty of #death# should i ever violate this oath
the general appeared to be affected by a nervous tremor which prevented his answering for some #moment# then overcoming his manifest repugnance he pronounced the required oath but in so low a #tone# as to be scarcely audible to the majority of the members who insisted on his repeating it clearly and distinctly which he did
the #president# rose appointed three members to accompany him and got into the #carriage# with the general after bandaging his #eye#
now am i at #liberty# to retire said the general #one# of those three members was the coachman who had driven them there
the #other# members silently dispersed where do you #wish# to be taken asked the #president# anywhere out of your #presence# replied $m_franz_d_épinay$
you are no longer in the assembly and have only to do with individuals do not insult them unless you #wish# to be held responsible
but instead of listening $m_franz_d_épinay$ went on you are still as brave in your #carriage# as in your assembly because you are still four against #one#
beware #sir# replied the #president# the #president# stopped the coach they were at that #part# of the quai des ormes where the #step# lead down to the river
why do you stop here asked épinay because #sir# said the #president# you have insulted a #man# and that #man# #will# not go #one# #step# farther without demanding honorable reparation
make no #noise# #sir# unless you #wish# me to consider you as #one# of the #man# of whom you spoke just now as cowards who take their weakness for a shield
you are alone #one# alone shall #answer# you you have a sword by your #side# i have #one# in my cane you have no witness #one# of these #gentleman# #will# serve you
another method of assassination said the general shrugging his #shoulder# now if you please remove your bandage
the general tore the handkerchief from his #eye# at last said he i shall know with whom i have to do
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ again interrupted himself and wiped the cold drops from his #brow# there was #something# awful in hearing the #son# read aloud in trembling pallor these details of his #father# #death# which had hitherto been a mystery
they opened the #door# and the four #man# alighted $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ clasped her #hand# as if in prayer $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looked at $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with an almost sublime #expression# of contempt and pride
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ continued it was as we said the fifth of february for three #day# the mercury had been five or six degrees below freezing and the #step# were covered with ice
the general was stout and tall the #president# offered him the #side# of the railing to assist him in getting down
the #ground# from the #step# to the river was covered with snow and hoarfrost the #water# of the river looked black and deep
the two witnesses followed it was a dark #night# #one# of the seconds went for a lantern in a coal barge near and by its #light# they examined the weapons
the #president# sword which was simply as he had said #one# he carried in his cane was five inches shorter than the general and had no guard
the general proposed to cast lots for the swords but the #president# said it was he who had given the provocation and when he had given it he had supposed each would #use# his own #arm#
the witnesses endeavored to insist but the #president# bade them be silent the lantern was placed on the #ground# the two adversaries took their stations and the duel began
the #light# made the two swords appear like flashes of lightning as for the #man# they were scarcely perceptible the #darkness# was so great
general épinay passed for #one# of the best swordsmen in the army but he was pressed so closely in the onset that he missed his aim and fell
the witnesses #thought# he was dead but his adversary who knew he had not struck him offered him the assistance of his #hand# to rise
the #circumstance# irritated instead of calming the general and he rushed on his adversary but his opponent did not allow his guard to be broken
he received him on his sword and three #time# the general drew back on finding himself too closely engaged and then returned to the charge
they #thought# he slipped as at first and the witnesses seeing he did not move approached and endeavored to raise him but the #one# who passed his #arm# around the #body# found it was moistened with #blood#
at the third he fell again the general who had almost fainted revived ah said he they have sent some fencing #master# to fight with me
the #president# without answering approached the witness who held the lantern and raising his sleeve showed him two wounds he had received in his #arm# then #opening# his coat and unbuttoning his waistcoat displayed his #side# pierced with a third wound
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ read these last #word# in a #voice# so choked that they were hardly audible and then stopped passing his #hand# over his #eye# as if to dispel a cloud but after a #moment# #silence# he continued
the #president# went up the #step# after pushing his sword into his cane a track of #blood# on the snow marked his #course#
still he had not even uttered a sigh general épinay died five #minute# after he had scarcely arrived at the top when he heard a heavy splash in the #water#
it was the general #body# which the witnesses had just thrown into the river after ascertaining that he was dead
in #proof# of this we have signed this #paper# to establish the #truth# of the #fact# lest the #moment# should arrive when either of the actors in this terrible #scene# should be accused of premeditated murder or of infringement of the #law# of #honor#
the general fell then in a loyal duel and not in ambush as it might have been reported signed beaurepaire duchampy and lecharpal
when $m_franz_de_quesnel$ had finished reading this #account# so dreadful for a #son# when $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ pale with #emotion# had wiped away a #tear# when $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ trembling and crouched in a #corner# had endeavored to lessen the storm by supplicating #glance# at the implacable old #man#
#sir# said épinay to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ since you are well acquainted with all these details which are attested by honorable signatures since you appear to take some #interest# in me although you have only manifested it hitherto by causing me sorrow refuse me not #one# final satisfaction tell me the #name# of the #president# of the club that i may at least know who killed my #father#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ mechanically felt for the handle of the #door# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ who understood sooner than #anyone# her #grandfather# #answer# and who had often seen two scars upon his #right# #arm# drew back a few #step#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ turning towards $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ unite your #effort# with mine to find out the #name# of the #man# who made me an orphan at two #year# of #age#
the #name# have been purposely concealed my #father# himself does not know who this #president# was and if he knows he cannot tell you proper #name# are not in the dictionary
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ remained dumb and motionless hold #sir# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ do not prolong this dreadful #scene#
the only #hope# which sustained me and enabled me to read to the #end# was that of knowing at least the #name# of him who killed my #father#
oh misery cried $m_franz_de_quesnel$ #sir# sir cried he turning to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ do what you can make me understand in some #way#
yes replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ oh $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ cried $m_franz_de_quesnel$ your #grandfather# says he can indicate the #person#
help me lend me your assistance $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looked at the dictionary $m_franz_de_quesnel$ took it with a nervous trembling and repeated the #letter# of the alphabet successively until he came to
at that #letter# the old #man# signified yes repeated $m_franz_de_quesnel$ the young #man# #finger# glided over the #word# but at each #one# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ answered by a negative #sign#
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ hid her #head# between her #hand# at #length# $m_franz_de_quesnel$ arrived at the #word# myself yes you cried $m_franz_de_quesnel$ whose #hair# stood on #end#
you $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ you killed my #father# yes replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ fixing a majestic #look# on the young #man#
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ fell powerless on a #chair# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ opened the #door# and escaped for the #idea# had entered his #mind# to stifle the little remaining #life# in the #heart# of this terrible old #man#
progress of $monsieur_cavalcanti$ the younger meanwhile $monsieur_cavalcanti$ the elder had returned to his #service# not in the army of his majesty the emperor of austria but at the gaming #table# of the baths of lucca of which he was #one# of the most assiduous courtiers
he had spent every farthing that had been allowed for his journey as a reward for the majestic and solemn #manner# in which he had maintained his assumed character of #father#
m $andrea_rondolo$ at his departure inherited all the #paper# which proved that he had indeed the #honor# of being the #son# of the marquis $bartolomeo_cavalcanti$ and the marchioness oliva corsinari
he was now fairly launched in that parisian society which gives such ready access to foreigners and treats them not as they really are but as they #wish# to be considered
#chapter# besides what is required of a young #man# in paris to speak its language tolerably to make a good #appearance# to be a good gamester and to pay in cash
they are certainly less particular with a foreigner than with a frenchman $andrea_rondolo$ had then in a fortnight attained a very fair #position#
he was called #count# he was said to possess livres per annum and his #father# immense riches buried in the quarries of saravezza were a constant theme
a learned #man# before whom the last #circumstance# was mentioned as a #fact# declared he had seen the quarries in #question# which gave great weight to assertions hitherto somewhat doubtful but which now assumed the garb of reality
such was the state of society in paris at the period we bring before our readers when $m_de_monte_cristo$ went #one# #evening# to pay $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ a #visit#
it was never without a nervous shudder since the #dinner# at $auteuil$ and the #event# which followed it that #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ heard $m_de_monte_cristo$ #name# announced
if he did not come the painful sensation became most intense if on the #contrary# he appeared his noble #countenance# his brilliant #eye# his amiability his polite #attention# even towards #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ soon dispelled every impression of #fear#
it appeared impossible to the #baroness# that a #man# of such delightfully pleasing #manner# should entertain evil designs against her besides the most corrupt #mind# only suspect evil when it would #answer# some interested #end# useless injury is repugnant to every #mind#
m $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was out but the #count# was asked to go and see the #baroness# and he accepted the invitation m
when $m_de_monte_cristo$ entered the boudoir to which we have already once introduced our readers and where the #baroness# was examining some #drawing# which her #daughter# passed to her after having looked at them with $monsieur_cavalcanti$ his #presence# soon produced its usual #effect# and it was with #smile# that the #baroness# received the #count# although she had been a little disconcerted at the announcement of his #name#
the latter took in the whole #scene# at a #glance# the #baroness# was partially reclining on a sofa $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ sat near her and $monsieur_cavalcanti$ was standing
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ dressed in black like #one# of goethe heroes with varnished shoes and white silk open worked stockings passed a white and tolerably nice looking #hand# through his #light# #hair# and so displayed a sparkling #diamond# that in #spite# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ advice the vain young #man# had been unable to resist putting on his little #finger#
this movement was accompanied by killing #glance# at $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and by sighs launched in the same direction $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was still the same cold beautiful and satirical
not #one# of these #glance# nor #one# sigh was lost on her they might have been said to fall on the shield of minerva which some philosophers assert protected sometimes the breast of sappho
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ bowed coldly to the #count# and availed herself of the first #moment# when the #conversation# became earnest to escape to her #study# whence very soon two cheerful and noisy #voice# being heard in connection with occasional #note# of the piano assured $m_de_monte_cristo$ that $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ preferred to his society and to that of $monsieur_cavalcanti$ the company of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ armilly her singing teacher
it was then especially while conversing with #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and apparently absorbed by the charm of the #conversation# that the #count# noticed $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ solicitude his #manner# of listening to the music at the #door# he dared not pass and of manifesting his admiration
as for his #wife# he bowed to her as some #husband# do to their #wife# but in a #way# that bachelors #will# never comprehend until a very extensive code is published on conjugal #life#
the #banker# soon returned his first #look# was certainly directed towards $m_de_monte_cristo$ but the second was for $andrea_rondolo$ have not the #lady# invited you to join them at the piano said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to $andrea_rondolo$
alas no #sir# replied $andrea_rondolo$ with a sigh still more remarkable than the former #one# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ immediately advanced towards the #door# and opened it
the two young #lady# were seen seated on the same #chair# at the piano accompanying themselves each with #one# #hand# a fancy to which they had accustomed themselves and performed admirably
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ armilly whom they then perceived through the open doorway formed with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #one# of the tableaux vivants of which the germans are so fond
a little fairy like figure with large curls falling on her neck which was rather too long as perugino sometimes makes his virgins and her #eye# dull from fatigue
she was said to have a weak chest and like antonia in the cremona violin she would die #one# #day# while singing
$m_de_monte_cristo$ cast #one# rapid and curious #glance# round this sanctum it was the first #time# he had ever seen $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ armilly of whom he had heard much
she was somewhat beautiful and exquisitely formed well said the #banker# to his #daughter# are we then all to be excluded
he then led the young #man# into the #study# and either by #chance# or manœuvre the #door# was partially closed after $andrea_rondolo$ so that from the #place# where they sat neither the #count# nor the #baroness# could see #anything# but as the #banker# had accompanied $andrea_rondolo$ #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ appeared to take no notice of it
while the #count# smiled at hearing this song which made him lose #sight# of $andrea_rondolo$ in the recollection of $m_benedetto$ #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was boasting to $m_de_monte_cristo$ of her #husband#
#strength# of #mind# who that very #morning# had lost three or four hundred thousand #franc# by a failure at milan
the praise was well deserved for had not the #count# heard it from the #baroness# or by #one# of those #mean# by which he knew #everything# the #baron#
the #count# soon heard $andrea_rondolo$ #voice# singing a corsican song accompanied by the piano #countenance# would not have led him to suspect it
hem #thought# $m_de_monte_cristo$ he begins to conceal his losses a #month# since he boasted of them then aloud oh #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is so skilful he #will# soon regain at the bourse what he loses elsewhere
i see that you participate in a prevalent error said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ what is it said $m_de_monte_cristo$
that $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ speculates whereas he never does truly #madame# i recollect $m_lucien_debray$ told me apropos what has become of him
i have seen #nothing# of him the last three or four #day# nor i said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ but you began a sentence #sir# and did not finish
which $m_lucien_debray$ had told you ah yes he told me it was you who sacrificed to the demon of speculation
i was once very fond of it but i do not indulge now then you are wrong #madame#
#fortune# is precarious and if i were a #woman# and fate had made me a #banker# #wife# whatever might be my confidence in my #husband# good #fortune# still in speculation
well i would secure for myself a #fortune# independent of him even if i acquired it by placing my #interest# in #hand# unknown to him
you know there is great risk #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ blushed in #spite# of all her #effort# stay said $m_de_monte_cristo$ as though he had not observed her confusion
i have heard of a lucky hit that was made #yesterday# on the neapolitan bonds i have none nor have i ever possessed any
but really we have talked long enough of #money# #count# we are like two stockbrokers have you heard how fate is persecuting the poor villeforts
you know the marquis of $madame_de_saint_méran$ died a few #day# after he had set out on his journey to paris and the marchioness a few #day# after her arrival
what has happened said the #count# simulating total ignorance yes said $m_de_monte_cristo$ i have heard that but as claudius said to hamlet
it is a #law# of #nature# their #father# died before them and they mourned their loss they #will# die before their #child# who #will# in their #turn# grieve for them
but that is not all not all no they were going to marry their #daughter#
to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay is it broken off #yesterday# #morning# it appears $m_franz_de_quesnel$ declined the #honor# indeed and is the #reason# known
no how extraordinary and how does $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ bear it as usual like a philosopher $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ returned at this #moment# alone
well said the #baroness# do you leave $monsieur_cavalcanti$ with your #daughter# and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ armilly said the #banker# do you consider her no #one#
then turning to $m_de_monte_cristo$ he said prince $monsieur_cavalcanti$ is a charming young #man# is he not but is he really a prince
his #father# was introduced to me as a marquis so he ought to be a #count# but i do not think he has much claim to that title
if he is a prince he is wrong not to maintain his rank i do not like #anyone# to deny his origin
i #will# not #answer# for it said $m_de_monte_cristo$ why said the #banker#
oh you are a thorough democrat said $m_de_monte_cristo$ smiling but do you see to what you are exposing yourself said the #baroness#
if perchance de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ came he would find $monsieur_cavalcanti$ in that #room# where he the betrothed of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ has never been admitted
you may well say perchance replied the #banker# for he comes so seldom it would seem only #chance# that brings him
but should he come and find that young #man# with your #daughter# he might be displeased he
you are mistaken $m_albert_de_morcerf$ would not do us the #honor# to be jealous he does not like $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ sufficiently besides i #care# not for his displeasure
at his #mother# ball he danced once with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and $monsieur_cavalcanti$ three #time# and he took no notice of it
still situated as we are yes do you know how we are situated the #valet# announced the vicomte $m_albert_de_morcerf$
the #baroness# rose hastily and was going into the #study# when $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ stopped her let her alone said he she looked at him in amazement
$m_de_monte_cristo$ appeared to be unconscious of what passed $m_albert_de_morcerf$ entered looking very handsome and in high spirits he bowed politely to the #baroness# familiarly to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and affectionately to $m_de_monte_cristo$
then turning to the #baroness# may i ask how $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is said he she is quite well replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ quickly she is at the piano with $monsieur_cavalcanti$
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ retained his calm and indifferent #manner# he might feel perhaps annoyed but he knew $m_de_monte_cristo$ #eye# was on him
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ has a fine tenor #voice# said he and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ a splendid soprano and then she plays the piano like thalberg
the concert must be a delightful #one# they suit each #other# remarkably well said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_albert_de_morcerf$ appeared not to notice this remark which was however so rude that #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ blushed
at least my #master# used to tell me so but it is strange that my #voice# never would suit any #other# and a soprano less than any
i too said the young #man# am a musician $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ smiled and seemed to say it is of no consequence
then hoping doubtless to #effect# his #purpose# he said the prince and my #daughter# were universally admired #yesterday# you were not of the party de $m_albert_de_morcerf$
what prince asked $m_albert_de_morcerf$ prince $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who persisted in giving the young #man# that title pardon me said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
i was not aware that he was a prince and prince $monsieur_cavalcanti$ sang with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #yesterday# it must have been charming indeed
but i was unable to accept your invitation having promised to accompany my #mother# to a german concert given by the #baroness# of $baron_de_château_renaud$ this was followed by rather an awkward #silence#
i regret not having heard them may i also be allowed said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ to pay my respects to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
wait a #moment# said the #banker# stopping the young #man# do you hear that delightful cavatina ta ta ta ti ta ti ta ta it is charming let them finish #one# #moment#
bravo bravi brava the #banker# was enthusiastic in his applause indeed said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ it is exquisite it is impossible to understand the music of his #country# better than prince $monsieur_cavalcanti$ does
you said prince did you not but he can easily become #one# if he is not already it is no uncommon #thing# in italy
ask them to sing #one# more song it is so delightful to hear music in the #distance# when the musicians are unrestrained by observation
but to #return# to the charming musicians you should give us a treat $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ without telling them there is a #stranger#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was quite annoyed by the young #man# indifference he took $m_de_monte_cristo$ aside what do you think of our lover said he
yes doubtless i have promised to give my #daughter# to a #man# who loves her but not to #one# who does not
he appears cool but then your #word# is given see him there cold as marble and proud like his #father#
if he were rich if he had $monsieur_cavalcanti$ #fortune# that might be pardoned ma foi i havent consulted my #daughter# but if she has good taste
oh said $m_de_monte_cristo$ my fondness may blind me but i assure you i consider $m_albert_de_morcerf$ a charming young #man# who #will# render your #daughter# happy and #will# sooner or later attain a certain amount of distinction and
his #father# #position# is good hem said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ why do you #doubt# the past that obscurity on the past
but that does not affect the #son# very true now i beg of you dont go off your #head#
it a #month# now that you have been thinking of this #marriage# and you must see that it throws some responsibility on me for it was at my $house_of_peers$ you met this young $monsieur_cavalcanti$ whom i do not really know at all
but i do have you made inquiry is there any need of that does not his #appearance# speak for him
and he is very rich i am not so sure of that and yet you said he had #money#
fifty thousand livres a mere trifle he is well educated hem said $m_de_monte_cristo$ in his #turn#
he is a musician so are all italians come #count# you do not do that young #man# #justice#
well i acknowledge it annoys me knowing your connection with the $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #family# to see him throw himself in the #way#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ burst out laughing what a puritan you are said he that happens every #day#
but you cannot break it off in this #way# the morcerfs are depending on this union indeed
positively then let them explain themselves you should give the #father# a hint you are so intimate with the #family#
why did not the #countess# the proud $mercédès$ the disdainful catalane who #will# scarcely open her #lip# to her oldest acquaintances take your #arm# lead you into the #garden# into the private walks and remain there for #half# an #hour#
i where the devil did you find out that at their ball it was apparent enough ah #baron# baron said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
you are not listening what barbarism in a megalomaniac like you oh dont worry about me #sir# mocker said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ then turning to $m_de_monte_cristo$ he said
but #will# you undertake to speak to the #father# willingly if you #wish# it but let it be done explicitly and positively
if he demands my #daughter# let him fix the #day# declare his conditions in short let us either understand each #other# or quarrel
you understand no more delay yes #sir# i #will# give my #attention# to the #subject# i do not say that i await with #pleasure# his decision but i do await it
a #banker# must you know be a slave to his #promise# and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ sighed as $monsieur_cavalcanti$ had done #half# an #hour# before
bravi bravo brava cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$ parodying the #banker# as the selection came to an #end# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ began to #look# suspiciously at $m_albert_de_morcerf$ when someone came and whispered a few #word# to him
i shall soon #return# said the #banker# to $m_de_monte_cristo$ wait for me i shall perhaps have #something# to say to you
absence to push open the #door# of her #daughter# #study# and $andrea_rondolo$ who was sitting before the piano with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ started up like a jack in the #box#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ bowed with a #smile# to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who did not appear in the least disturbed and returned his bow with her usual coolness
and he went out the #baroness# took advantage of her #husband# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ was evidently embarrassed he bowed to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who replied with the most impertinent #look# possible
then $m_albert_de_morcerf$ launched out in praise of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #voice# and on his regret after what he had just heard that he had been unable to be present the previous #evening#
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ being left alone turned to $m_de_monte_cristo$ come said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ leave music and compliments and let us go and take tea
just as they were beginning in the english fashion to leave the spoons in their cups the #door# again opened and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ entered visibly agitated
come $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to her #friend# they passed into the next #drawing# #room# where tea was prepared $m_de_monte_cristo$ observed it particularly and by a #look# asked the #banker# for an explanation
i have just received my courier from greece said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ ah yes said the #count# that was the #reason# of your running away from us
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ cast another suspicious #look# towards him without answering and $m_de_monte_cristo$ turned away to conceal the #expression# of #pity# which passed over his #feature# but which was gone in a #moment#
yes how is #king# otho getting on asked $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in the most sprightly #tone# we shall go together shall we not said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ to the #count#
if you like replied the latter $m_albert_de_morcerf$ could not understand the #banker# #look# and turning to $m_de_monte_cristo$ who understood it perfectly did
you see said he how he looked at me yes said the #count# but did you think there was #anything# particular in his #look#
indeed i did and what does he #mean# by his news from greece how can i tell you
because i imagine you have correspondents in that #country# $m_de_monte_cristo$ smiled significantly stop said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ here he comes
i shall compliment $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ on her cameo while the #father# talks to you if you compliment her at all let it be on her #voice# at least said $m_de_monte_cristo$
no #everyone# would do that my dear viscount you are dreadfully impertinent $m_albert_de_morcerf$ advanced towards $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ smiling
meanwhile $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ stooping to $m_de_monte_cristo$ ear your advice was excellent said he there is a whole history connected with the #name# $m_fernand_mondego$ and $ali_pasha_of_yanina$
indeed said $m_de_monte_cristo$ yes i #will# tell you all but take away the young #man# i cannot endure his #presence#
he is going with me shall i send the #father# to you immediately very well
the #count# made a #sign# to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and they bowed to the #lady# and took their leave $m_albert_de_morcerf$ perfectly indifferent to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ contempt $m_de_monte_cristo$ reiterating his advice to #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ on the prudence a #banker# #wife# should exercise in providing for the future
$haydée$ scarcely had the #count# #horse# cleared the angle of the boulevard when $m_albert_de_morcerf$ turning towards the #count# burst into a loud fit of laughter
m $monsieur_cavalcanti$ remained #master# of the field #chapter# much too loud in #fact# not to give the #idea# of its being rather forced and unnatural
well said he i #will# ask you the same #question# which charles ix put to catherine de medici after the massacre of saint bartholomew
how have i played my little #part# to what do you allude asked $m_de_monte_cristo$ to the installation of my rival at $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
what rival ma foi what rival why your protégé $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ ah no joking viscount if you please i do not patronize $andrea_rondolo$ at least not as concerns $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
and you would be to blame for not assisting him if the young #man# really needed your help in that #quarter# but happily for me he can dispense with it
what do you think he is paying his addresses i am certain of it his languishing #look# and modulated #tone# when addressing $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ fully proclaim his intentions
he aspires to the #hand# of the proud $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ what does that signify so long as they favor your suit
but it is not the #case# my dear #count# on the #contrary# i am repulsed on all #side#
it is so indeed $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ scarcely #answer# me and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ armilly her confidant does not speak to me at all
oh no he has plunged a thousand daggers into my #heart# tragedy weapons i own which instead of wounding sheathe their #point# in their own handles but daggers which he nevertheless believed to be real and deadly
what but the #father# has the greatest regard possible for you said $m_de_monte_cristo$ he jealousy indicates affection
true but i am not jealous he is of whom of $m_lucien_debray$ no of you
of me i #will# engage to say that before a week is past the #door# #will# be closed against me
you are mistaken my dear viscount prove it to me do you #wish# me to do so
well i am charged with the commission of endeavoring to induce the comte de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ to make some definite arrangement with the #baron#
yes by whom are you charged by the #baron# himself oh said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with all the cajolery of which he was capable
you surely #will# not do that my dear #count# certainly i shall $m_albert_de_morcerf$ as i have promised to do it
well said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with a sigh it seems you are determined to marry me i am determined to try and be on good terms with everybody at all #event# said $m_de_monte_cristo$
but apropos of $m_lucien_debray$ how is it that i have not seen him lately at the #baron# $house_of_peers$
there has been a misunderstanding what with the #baroness# no with the #baron# has he perceived #anything#
ah that is a good joke do you think he suspects said $m_de_monte_cristo$ with charming artlessness where have you come from my dear #count# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
from congo if you #will# it must be farther off than even that but what do i know of your parisian #husband#
oh my dear #count# #husband# are pretty much the same everywhere an individual #husband# of any #country# is a pretty fair specimen of the whole race
but then what can have led to the quarrel between $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and $m_lucien_debray$ they seemed to understand each #other# so well said $m_de_monte_cristo$ with renewed energy
ah now you are trying to penetrate into the mysteries of isis in which i am not initiated when $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ has become #one# of the #family# you can ask him that #question#
the #carriage# stopped here we are said $m_de_monte_cristo$ it is only #half# past ten clock come in
certainly i #will# my #carriage# shall take you back no #thank# you i gave #order# for my coupé to follow me
there it is then said $m_de_monte_cristo$ as he stepped out of the #carriage# they both went into the $house_of_peers$ the #drawing# #room# was lighted up
$monsieur_baptistin$ left the #room# without waiting to #answer# and in two seconds reappeared bringing on a tray all that his #master# had ordered ready prepared and appearing to have sprung from the #ground# like the repasts which we read of in fairy tales
really my dear #count# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ what i admire in you is not so much your riches for perhaps there are #people# even wealthier than yourself nor is it only your wit for beaumarchais might have possessed as much but
it is your #manner# of being served without any #question# in a #moment# in a second it is as if they guessed what you wanted by your #manner# of ringing and made a #point# of keeping #everything# you can possibly #desire# in constant readiness
they went in there you #will# make tea for us $monsieur_baptistin$ said the #count# what you say is perhaps true they know my habits
for instance you shall see how do you #wish# to occupy yourself during tea #time# ma foi i should like to smoke
in about the space of a second a private #door# opened and $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ appeared bringing two chibouques filled with excellent latakia
$m_de_monte_cristo$ took the gong and struck it once it is quite wonderful said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ oh no it is as simple as possible replied $m_de_monte_cristo$
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ knows i generally smoke while i am taking my tea or coffee he has heard that i ordered tea and he also knows that i brought you home with me when i summoned him he naturally guessed the #reason# of my doing so and as he comes from a #country# where hospitality is especially manifested through the medium of smoking he naturally concludes that we shall smoke in company and therefore brings two chibouques instead of #one# and now the mystery is solved
certainly you give a most commonplace #air# to your explanation but it is not the less true that you
ah but what do i hear and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ inclined his #head# towards the #door# through which #sound# seemed to issue resembling those of a guitar
ma foi my dear viscount you are fated to hear music this #evening# you have only escaped from $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ piano to be attacked by $haydée$ guzla
$haydée$ what an adorable #name# are there then really #woman# who bear the #name# of $haydée$ anywhere but in byron poems
$haydée$ is a very uncommon #name# in france but is common enough in albania and epirus it is as if you said for example chastity modesty innocence it is a kind of baptismal #name# as you parisians call it
oh that is charming said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ how i should like to hear my countrywomen called $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ goodness $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #silence# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ christian charity
only think then if $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ instead of being called claire marie $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had been named $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ chastity modesty innocence $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ what a fine #effect# that would have produced on the announcement of her #marriage#
certainly there are hush said the #count# do not joke in so loud a #tone# $haydée$ may hear you perhaps
and you think she would be angry no certainly not said the #count# with a haughty #expression#
she is very amiable then is she not said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ it is not to be called amiability it is her #duty# a slave does not dictate to a #master#
come you are joking yourself now are there any more slaves to be had who bear this beautiful #name# undoubtedly
really #count# you do #nothing# and have #nothing# like #other# #people# the slave of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
why it is a rank of itself in france and from the #way# in which you lavish #money# it is a #place# that must be worth a hundred thousand #franc# a #year#
the poor #girl# originally possessed much more than that she was born to #treasure# in comparison with which those recorded in the thousand and #one# #night# would seem but poverty
a hundred thousand #franc# she must be a princess then you are #right# and she is #one# of the greatest in her #country# too
i #thought# so but how did it happen that such a great princess became a slave how was it that dionysius the tyrant became a schoolmaster
the #fortune# of war my dear viscount the caprice of #fortune# that is the #way# in which these #thing# are to be accounted for
as regards the generality of mankind it is but not for you my dear viscount who are #one# of my most intimate #friend# and on whose #silence# i feel i may rely if i consider it necessary to enjoin it
and is her #name# a #secret# may i not do so certainly on my #word# of #honor#
you know the history of the $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ do you not of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ tepelini oh yes it was in his #service# that my #father# made his #fortune#
true i had forgotten that well what is $haydée$ to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ tepelini merely his #daughter#
what the #daughter# of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and the beautiful $vasiliki$ and your slave
why simply from the #circumstance# of my having bought her #one# #day# as i was passing through the market at constantinople
really my dear #count# you seem to throw a #sort# of magic influence over all in which you are concerned when i listen to you existence no longer seems reality but a waking #dream#
ma foi yes but how did she become so wonderful now i am perhaps going to make an imprudent and thoughtless request but
say on but since you go out with $haydée$ and sometimes even take her to the opera well
i think i may venture to ask you this favor you may venture to ask me #anything#
well then my dear #count# present me to your princess i #will# do so but on two conditions
i accept them at once the first is that you #will# never tell #anyone# that i have granted the interview
very well said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ extending his #hand# i swear i #will# not the second is that you #will# not tell her that your #father# ever served hers
i give you my oath that i #will# not enough viscount you #will# remember those two vows #will# you not
but i know you to be a #man# of #honor# the #count# again struck the gong $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ reappeared tell $haydée$ said he
that i #will# take coffee with her and give her to understand that i #desire# permission to present #one# of my #friend# to her
now understand me said the #count# no direct #question# my dear $m_albert_de_morcerf$ if you #wish# to know #anything# tell me and i #will# ask her
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ reappeared for the third #time# and drew back the tapestried hanging which concealed the #door# to signify to his #master# and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ that they were at #liberty# to pass on
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ passed his #hand# through his #hair# and curled his moustache then having satisfied himself as to his personal #appearance# followed the #count# into the #room# the latter having previously resumed his hat and gloves
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ was stationed as a kind of advanced guard and the #door# was kept by the three french attendants commanded by myrtho
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ bowed and left the #room# agreed let us go in said $m_de_monte_cristo$ $haydée$ was awaiting her visitors in the first #room# of her #apartment# which was the #drawing# #room#
her large #eye# were dilated with surprise and expectation for it was the first #time# that any #man# except $m_de_monte_cristo$ had been accorded an entrance into her #presence#
she was sitting on a sofa placed in an angle of the #room# with her legs crossed under her in the eastern fashion and seemed to have made for herself as it were a kind of nest in the rich indian silks which enveloped her
near her was the instrument on which she had just been playing it was elegantly fashioned and worthy of its mistress
on perceiving $m_de_monte_cristo$ she arose and welcomed him with a #smile# peculiar to herself expressive at once of the most implicit obedience and also of the deepest #love#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ had proceeded no farther than the #door# where he remained rooted to the #spot# being completely fascinated by the #sight# of such surpassing beauty beheld as it was for the first #time# and of which an inhabitant of more northern climes could form no adequate #idea#
whom do you bring asked the young #girl# in romaic of $m_de_monte_cristo$ is it a #friend# a #brother# a simple acquaintance or an #enemy#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ advanced towards her and extended his #hand# which she as usual raised to her #lip#
a #friend# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ in the same language what is his #name# #count# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ it is the same #man# whom i rescued from the #hand# of the banditti at rome
in what language would you like me to converse with him $m_de_monte_cristo$ turned to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ do you know modern greek asked he
no said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ nor even ancient greek my dear #count# never had homer or plato a more unworthy scholar than myself
alas then said $haydée$ proving by her remark that she had quite understood $m_de_monte_cristo$ #question# and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #answer#
then i #will# speak either in french or italian if my lord so #will# it $m_de_monte_cristo$ reflected #one# #instant#
then turning towards $m_albert_de_morcerf$ it is a #pity# you do not understand either ancient or modern greek both of which $haydée$ speaks so fluently the poor #child# #will# be obliged to talk to you in italian which #will# give you but a very false #idea# of her #power# of #conversation#
you #will# speak in italian said he the #count# made a #sign# to $haydée$ to address his visitor
this was said in excellent tuscan and with that soft roman accent which makes the language of dante as sonorous as that of homer
then turning to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ she directed him to bring coffee and pipes and when he had left the #room# to execute the #order# of his young mistress she beckoned $m_albert_de_morcerf$ to approach nearer to her
$m_de_monte_cristo$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ drew their #seat# towards a small #table# on which were arranged music #drawing# and vases of flowers
#sir# she said to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ you are most welcome as the #friend# of my lord and #master# $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ then entered bringing coffee and chibouques as to $monsieur_baptistin$ this portion of the building was interdicted to him
$haydée$ is almost as civilized as a parisian the smell of a havana is disagreeable to her but the tobacco of the east is a most delicious perfume you know
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ refused the pipe which the nubian offered him oh take it take it said the #count# $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ left the #room#
the cups of coffee were all prepared with the addition of sugar which had been brought for $m_albert_de_morcerf$ $m_de_monte_cristo$ and $haydée$ took the beverage in the original arabian #manner# that is to say without sugar
$haydée$ took the porcelain cup in her little slender #finger# and conveyed it to her mouth with all the innocent artlessness of a #child# when eating or drinking #something# which it likes
at this #moment# two #woman# entered bringing salvers filled with ices and sherbet which they placed on two small #table# appropriated to that #purpose#
my dear host and you signora said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in italian excuse my apparent stupidity i am quite bewildered and it is natural that it should be so
here i am in the #heart# of paris but a #moment# ago i heard the rumbling of the omnibuses and the tinkling of the bells of the lemonade sellers and now i feel as if i were suddenly transported to the east not such as i have seen it but such as my #dream# have painted it
oh signora if i could but speak greek your #conversation# added to the fairy #scene# which surrounds me would furnish an #evening# of such delight as it would be impossible for me ever to forget
and if you like what is eastern i #will# do my best to secure the gratification of your tastes while you are here
i speak sufficient italian to enable me to converse with you #sir# said $haydée$ quietly on what #subject# shall i converse with her said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in a low #tone# to $m_de_monte_cristo$
just what you please you may speak of her #country# and of her youthful reminiscences or if you like it better you can talk of rome naples or florence
it is of no #use# to be in the company of a greek if #one# converses just in the same style as with a parisian let me speak to her of the east
oh said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ do so then for of all themes which you could choose that #will# be the most agreeable to her taste
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ turned towards $haydée$ at what #age# did you leave greece signora asked he i left it when i was but five #year# old replied $haydée$
and have you any recollection of your #country# when i shut my #eye# and think i seem to see it all again
the #mind# can see as well as the #body# the #body# forgets sometimes but the #mind# always remembers and how far back into the past do your recollections extend
i could scarcely walk when my #mother# who was called $vasiliki$ which #mean# royal said the young #girl# tossing her #head# proudly
took me by the #hand# and after putting in our purse all the #money# we possessed we went out both covered with veils to solicit alms for the #prisoner# saying
then when our purse was full we returned to the palace and without saying a #word# to my #father# we sent it to the convent where it was divided amongst the #prisoner#
he who giveth to the poor lendeth to the lord and how old were you at that #time#
i was three #year# old said $haydée$ then you remember #everything# that went on about you from the #time# when you were three #year# old said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
#count# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in a low #tone# to $m_de_monte_cristo$ do allow the signora to tell me #something# of her history
#name# to her but perhaps she #will# allude to him of her own accord in the #course# of the recital and you have no #idea# how delighted i should be to hear our #name# pronounced by such beautiful #lip#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ turned to $haydée$ and with an #expression# of #countenance# which commanded her to pay the most implicit #attention# to his #word# he said in greek
#everything# you prohibited my mentioning my #father# πατρὸς μὲν ἄτην μήζε τὸ ὄνομα προδότου καὶ προδοσίαν εἰπὲ ἡμῖν that is
tell us the fate of your #father# but neither the #name# of the traitor nor the treason $haydée$ sighed deeply and a shade of sadness clouded her beautiful #brow#
what are you saying to her said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in an undertone i again reminded her that you were a #friend# and that she need not conceal #anything# from you
then said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ this pious pilgrimage in behalf of the #prisoner# was your first remembrance what is the next
oh then i remember as if it were but #yesterday# sitting under the shade of some sycamore #tree# on the borders of a lake in the #water# of which the trembling foliage was reflected as in a mirror
under the oldest and thickest of these #tree# reclining on cushions sat my #father# my #mother# was at his #foot# and i childlike amused myself by playing with his long white beard which descended to his girdle or with the #diamond# hilt of the scimitar attached to his girdle
then from #time# to #time# there came to him an albanian who said #something# to which i paid no #attention# but which he always answered in the same #tone# of #voice# either
it is very strange said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ to hear such #word# proceed from the mouth of #anyone# but an actress on the stage and #one# needs constantly to be saying to #one# self
kill or pardon this is no fiction it is all reality in #order# to believe it
and how does france appear in your #eye# accustomed as they have been to gaze on such enchanted #scene#
but i see france as it really is because i #look# on it with the #eye# of a #woman# whereas my own #country# which i can only judge of from the impression produced on my childish #mind# always seems enveloped in a vague atmosphere which is luminous or otherwise according as my remembrances of it are sad or joyous
so young said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ forgetting at the #moment# the #count# command that he should ask no #question# of the slave herself
i think it is a fine #country# said $haydée$ is it possible that you can have known what suffering is except by #name#
$haydée$ turned her #eye# towards $m_de_monte_cristo$ who making at the same #time# some imperceptible #sign# murmured εἰπέ speak
#nothing# is ever so firmly impressed on the #mind# as the memory of our early childhood and with the exception of the two #scene# i have just described to you all my earliest reminiscences are fraught with deepest sadness
speak speak signora said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i am listening with the most intense delight and #interest# to all you say
$haydée$ answered his remark with a melancholy #smile# you #wish# me then to relate the history of my past sorrows said she
i beg you to do so replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ well i was but four #year# old when #one# #night# i was suddenly awakened by my #mother#
we were in the palace of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ she snatched me from the cushions on which i was sleeping and on #opening# my #eye# i saw hers filled with #tear#
she took me away without speaking when i saw her weeping i began to #cry# too hush #child# said she
caprice been accustomed to indulge my #feeling# of sorrow or anger by crying as much as i felt inclined but on this occasion there was an intonation of such extreme #terror# in my #mother# #voice# when she enjoined me to #silence# that i ceased crying as soon as her command was given
at #other# #time# in #spite# of maternal endearments or threats i had with a #child# she bore me rapidly away
i saw then that we were descending a large #staircase# around us were all my #mother# #servant# carrying trunks bags ornaments jewels purses of #gold# with which they were hurrying away in the greatest distraction
behind the #woman# came a guard of twenty #man# armed with long guns and #pistol# and dressed in the #costume# which the greeks have assumed since they have again become a nation
you may imagine there was #something# startling and ominous said $haydée$ shaking her #head# and turning pale at the mere remembrance of the #scene# in this long file of slaves and #woman# only #half# aroused from sleep or
here and there on the #wall# of the #staircase# were reflected gigantic #shadow# which trembled in the flickering #light# of the pine torches till they seemed to reach to the vaulted roof above
at least so they appeared to me who was myself scarcely awake quick said a #voice# at the #end# of the gallery
this #voice# made #everyone# bow before it resembling in its #effect# the wind passing over a field of wheat by its superior #strength# forcing every ear to yield obeisance
as for me it made me tremble this #voice# was that of my #father# he came last clothed in his splendid robes and holding in his #hand# the carbine which your emperor presented him
he was leaning on the #shoulder# of his favorite $selim$ and he drove us all before him as a shepherd would his straggling flock
my #father# said $haydée$ raising her #head# was that illustrious #man# known in europe under the #name# of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ tepelini $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and before whom turkey trembled
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ without knowing why started on hearing these #word# pronounced with such a haughty and dignified accent it appeared to him as if there was #something# supernaturally gloomy and terrible in the #expression# which gleamed from the brilliant #eye# of $haydée$ at this #moment# she appeared like a pythoness evoking a spectre as she recalled to his #mind# the remembrance of the fearful #death# of this #man# to the news of which all europe had listened with horror
my #mother# pressed me to her throbbing #heart# and at the #distance# of a few paces i saw my #father# who was glancing anxiously around
soon said $haydée$ we halted on our march and found ourselves on the borders of a lake four marble #step# led down to the #water# edge and below them was a #boat# floating on the tide
from where we stood i could see in the middle of the lake a large blank mass it was the kiosk to which we were going
this kiosk appeared to me to be at a considerable #distance# perhaps on #account# of the #darkness# of the #night# which prevented any object from being more than partially discerned
i remember well that the oars made no #noise# whatever in striking the #water# and when i leaned over to ascertain the cause i saw that they were muffled with the sashes of our palikares
we stepped into the #boat# besides the rowers the #boat# contained only the #woman# my #father# #mother# $selim$ and myself
the palikares had remained on the shore of the lake ready to cover our retreat they were kneeling on the lowest of the marble #step# and in that #manner# intended making a rampart of the three #other# in #case# of pursuit
our bark flew before the wind why does the #boat# go so fast asked i of my #mother#
#silence# #child# hush we are flying i did not understand why should my #father# fly he the all powerful he before whom #other# were accustomed to fly
he who had taken for his device they hate me then they #fear# me it was indeed a flight which my #father# was trying to #effect#
i have been told since that the garrison of the castle of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ fatigued with long #service# here $haydée$ cast a significant #glance# at $m_de_monte_cristo$ whose #eye# had been riveted on her #countenance# during the whole #course# of her narrative
the young #girl# then continued speaking slowly like a #person# who is either inventing or suppressing some #feature# of the history which he is relating
you were saying signora said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who was paying the most implicit #attention# to the recital that the garrison of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ fatigued with long #service#
had treated with the seraskier kourchid who had been sent by the sultan to gain #possession# of the #person# of my #father# it was then that $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ tepelini after having sent to the sultan a french #officer# in whom he reposed great confidence resolved to retire to the asylum which he had long before prepared for himself and which he called kataphygion or the refuge
and this #officer# asked $m_albert_de_morcerf$ do you remember his #name# signora $m_de_monte_cristo$ exchanged a rapid #glance# with the young #girl# which was quite unperceived by $m_albert_de_morcerf$
i do not remember it just at this #moment# but if it should occur to me presently i #will# tell you
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ was on the #point# of pronouncing his #father# #name# when $m_de_monte_cristo$ gently held up his #finger# in token of reproach the young #man# recollected his #promise# and was silent
a #ground# #floor# ornamented with arabesques bathing its terraces in the #water# and another #floor# looking on the lake was all which was visible to the #eye#
but beneath the #ground# #floor# stretching out into the #island# was a large subterranean cavern to which my #mother# myself and the #woman# were conducted
in this #place# were together pouches and barrels the pouches contained of #money# in #gold# and the barrels were filled with pounds of gunpowder
no said she it was towards this kiosk that we were rowing near the barrels stood $selim$ my #father# favorite whom i mentioned to you just now
he stood watch #day# and #night# with a lance provided with a lighted slowmatch in his #hand# and he had #order# to blow up #everything#
i remember well that the slaves convinced of the precarious tenure on which they held their #life# passed whole #day# and #night# in praying crying and groaning
as for me i can never forget the pale complexion and black #eye# of the young #soldier# and whenever the angel of #death# summons me to another #world# i am quite sure i shall recognize $selim$
i cannot tell you how long we remained in this state at that period i did not even know what #time# meant
sometimes but very rarely my #father# summoned me and my #mother# to the terrace of the palace these were #hour# of recreation for me as i never saw #anything# in the dismal cavern but the gloomy #countenance# of the slaves and $selim$ fiery lance
my #father# was endeavoring to pierce with his eager #look# the remotest verge of the horizon examining attentively every black speck which appeared on the lake while my #mother# reclining by his #side# rested her #head# on his #shoulder# and i played at his #foot# admiring #everything# i saw with that unsophisticated innocence of childhood which throws a charm round objects insignificant in themselves but which in its #eye# are invested with the greatest importance
the heights of pindus towered above us the castle of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ rose white and angular from the blue #water# of the lake and the immense masses of black vegetation which viewed in the #distance# gave the #idea# of lichens clinging to the #rock# were in reality gigantic fir #tree# and myrtles
#one# #morning# my #father# sent for us my #mother# had been crying all the #night# and was very wretched we found the pasha calm but paler than usual
kiosk guards #woman# #gold# and $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ tepelini himself at the first signal given by my #father# take courage $vasiliki$ said he
if my pardon be complete we shall #return# triumphant to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ if the news be inauspicious we must fly this #night# but supposing our #enemy# should not allow us to do so
#today# arrives the firman of the #master# and my fate #will# be decided said my #mother# oh make yourself easy on that #head# said $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ smiling $selim$ and his flaming lance #will# settle that #matter#
they would be glad to see me dead but they would not like themselves to die with me my #mother# only answered by sighs to consolations which she knew did not come from my #father# #heart#
she prepared the iced #water# which he was in the habit of constantly drinking for since his sojourn at the kiosk he had been parched by the most violent fever after which she anointed his white beard with perfumed oil and lighted his chibouque which he sometimes smoked for #hour# together quietly watching the wreaths of vapor that ascended in spiral clouds and gradually melted away in the surrounding atmosphere
presently he made such a sudden movement that i was paralyzed with #fear# then without taking his #eye# from the object which had first attracted his #attention# he asked for his telescope
my #mother# gave it him and as she did so looked whiter than the marble against which she leaned i saw my #father# #hand# tremble
a #boat# two three murmured my #father# four he then arose seizing his #arm# and priming his #pistol# $vasiliki$ said he to my #mother# trembling perceptibly
the #instant# approaches which #will# decide #everything# in the space of #half# an #hour# we shall know the emperor #answer# go into the cavern with $haydée$ i #will# not quit you said $vasiliki$
if you die my lord i #will# die with you go to $selim$ cried my #father# adieu my lord murmured my #mother# determining quietly to await the approach of #death#
as for me i had been forgotten in the general confusion i ran toward $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ tepelini he saw me hold out my #arm# to him and he stooped down and pressed my #forehead# with his #lip#
oh how distinctly i remember that kiss it was the last he ever gave me and i feel as if it were still warm on my #forehead#
take away $vasiliki$ said my #father# to his palikares on descending we saw through the lattice #work# several #boat# which were gradually becoming more distinct to our view
at first they appeared like black specks and now they looked like birds skimming the surface of the waves during this #time# in the kiosk at my #father#
#foot# were seated twenty palikares concealed from view by an angle of the #wall# and watching with eager #eye# the arrival of the #boat#
they were armed with their long guns inlaid with #mother# of pearl and silver and cartridges in great numbers were lying scattered on the #floor#
my #father# looked at his watch and paced up and down with a #countenance# expressive of the greatest anguish this was the #scene# which presented itself to my view as i quitted my #father# after that last kiss
my #mother# and i traversed the gloomy passage leading to the cavern $selim$ was still at his post and smiled sadly on us as we entered
in great dangers the devoted #one# cling to each #other# and young as i was i quite understood that some imminent danger was hanging over our #head#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ had often heard not from his #father# for he never spoke on the #subject# but from #stranger# the description of the last #moment# of the vizier of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ he had read different #account# of his #death# but the #story# seemed to acquire fresh meaning from the #voice# and #expression# of the young #girl# and her sympathetic accent and the melancholy #expression# of her #countenance# at once charmed and horrified him
as to $haydée$ these terrible reminiscences seemed to have overpowered her for a #moment# for she ceased speaking her #head# leaning on her #hand# like a beautiful flower bowing beneath the violence of the storm and her #eye# gazing on vacancy indicated that she was mentally contemplating the green summit of the pindus and the blue #water# of the lake of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ which like a magic mirror seemed to reflect the sombre picture which she sketched
we fetched our cushions from the #other# #end# of the cavern and sat down by $selim$ $m_de_monte_cristo$ looked at her with an indescribable #expression# of #interest# and #pity#
$haydée$ looked up abruptly as if the sonorous #tone# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ #voice# had awakened her from a #dream# and she resumed her narrative
it was about four clock in the afternoon and although the #day# was brilliant out of #door# we were enveloped in the gloomy #darkness# of the cavern
#one# single solitary #light# was burning there and it appeared like a star set in a heaven of blackness it was $selim$ flaming lance
go on my #child# said the #count# in the romaic language my #mother# was a christian and she prayed
as she was coming down she #thought# she recognized the french #officer# who had been sent to constantinople and in whom my #father# placed so much confidence for he knew that all the #soldier# of the french emperor were naturally noble and generous
$selim$ repeated from #time# to #time# the sacred #word# god is great however my #mother# had still some #hope# she advanced some #step# towards the #staircase# and listened
they are approaching said she perhaps they bring us peace and #liberty# what do you #fear# $vasiliki$ said $selim$ in a #voice# at once so gentle and yet so proud
if they do not bring us peace we #will# give them war if they do not bring #life# we #will# give them #death#
and he renewed the flame of his lance with a gesture which made #one# think of dionysus of old crete
but i being only a little #child# was terrified by this undaunted courage which appeared to me both ferocious and senseless and i recoiled with horror from the #idea# of the frightful #death# amidst #fire# and flames which probably awaited us
my #mother# experienced the same sensations for i felt her tremble mamma mamma said i are we really to be killed
and at the #sound# of my #voice# the slaves redoubled their #cry# and prayers and lamentations my #child# said $vasiliki$ may god preserve you from ever wishing for that #death#
if he send me his poniard it #will# signify that the emperor intentions are not favorable and i am to set #fire# to the powder if on the #contrary# he send me his ring it #will# be a #sign# that the emperor pardons him and i am to extinguish the match and leave the magazine untouched my #friend# said my #mother# when your #master# #order# arrive if it is the poniard which he sends instead of despatching us by that horrible #death# which we both so much dread you #will# mercifully kill us with this same poniard #will# you not yes $vasiliki$ replied $selim$ tranquilly
which #today# you so much dread then whispering to $selim$ she asked what were her #master# #order# suddenly we heard loud #cry# and listening discerned that they were #cry# of #joy#
the #name# of the french #officer# who had been sent to constantinople resounded on all #side# amongst our palikares it was evident that he brought the #answer# of the emperor and that it was favorable
and do you not remember the frenchman #name# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ quite ready to aid the memory of the narrator
$m_de_monte_cristo$ made a #sign# to him to be silent i do not recollect it said $haydée$ the #noise# increased #step# were heard approaching nearer and nearer they were descending the #step# leading to the cavern
soon a figure appeared in the gray twilight at the entrance of the cave formed by the reflection of the few rays of daylight which had found their #way# into this gloomy retreat
$selim$ made ready his lance who are you cried $selim$ but whoever you may be i charge you not to advance another #step# long live the emperor
he grants a full pardon to the vizier $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and not only gives him his #life# but restores to him his #fortune# and his #possession#
said the figure my #mother# uttered a #cry# of #joy# and clasped me to her bosom stop said $selim$ seeing that she was about to go out
and she fell on her knees at the same #time# holding me up towards heaven as if she desired while praying to god in my behalf to raise me actually to his #presence#
and for the second #time# $haydée$ stopped overcome by such violent #emotion# that the perspiration stood upon her pale #brow# and her stifled #voice# seemed hardly able to find utterance so parched and dry were her throat and #lip#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ poured a little iced #water# into a #glass# and presented it to her saying with a mildness in which was also a shade of command courage
you see i have not yet received the ring true said my #mother# $haydée$ dried her #eye# and continued
by this #time# our #eye# habituated to the #darkness# had recognized the messenger of the pasha it was a #friend# $selim$ had also recognized him but the brave young #man# only acknowledged #one# #duty# which was to obey
in whose #name# do you come said he to him i come in the #name# of our #master#
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ tepelini if you come from $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ himself said $selim$ you know what you were charged to remit to me yes said the messenger
at these #word# he raised his #hand# above his #head# to show the token but it was too far off and there was not #light# enough to enable $selim$ where he was standing to distinguish and recognize the object presented to his view
and i bring you his ring i do not see what you have in your #hand# said $selim$
or i #will# come nearer to you if you prefer it i #will# agree to neither #one# nor the #other# replied the young #soldier#
#place# the object which i #desire# to see in the ray of #light# which shines there and retire while i examine it be it so said the envoy and he retired after having first deposited the token agreed on in the #place# pointed out to him by $selim$
approach then said the messenger oh how our #heart# palpitated for it did indeed seem to be a ring which was placed there
$selim$ still holding in his #hand# the lighted match walked towards the #opening# in the cavern and aided by the faint #light# which streamed in through the mouth of the cave picked up the token
but was it my #father# ring that was the #question# it is well said he kissing it
it is my #master# ring and throwing the match on the #ground# he trampled on it and extinguished it the messenger uttered a #cry# of #joy# and clapped his #hand#
each #man# had stabbed him separately and intoxicated by their #crime# though still pale with #fear# they sought all over the cavern to discover if there was any #fear# of #fire# after which they amused themselves by rolling on the bags of #gold#
at this #moment# my #mother# seized me in her #arm# and hurrying noiselessly along numerous turnings and windings known only to ourselves she arrived at a private #staircase# of the kiosk where was a #scene# of frightful tumult and confusion
at this signal four #soldier# of the seraskier kourchid suddenly appeared and $selim$ fell pierced by five blows the lower #room# were entirely filled with kourchid troops that is to say with our #enemy#
just as my #mother# was on the #point# of pushing open a small #door# we heard the #voice# of the pasha sounding in a loud and threatening #tone#
my #mother# applied her #eye# to the crack between the #board# i luckily found a small #opening# which afforded me a view of the #apartment# and what was passing within
what do you want said my #father# to some #people# who were holding a #paper# inscribed with characters of #gold#
what we want replied #one# is to communicate to you the #will# of his highness do you see this firman i do said my #father#
my #father# answered with a loud laugh which was more frightful than even threats would have been and he had not ceased when two reports of a #pistol# were heard he had fired them himself and had killed two #man#
the palikares who were prostrated at my #father# #foot# now sprang up and fired and the #room# was filled with #fire# and smoke
well read it he demands your #head# at the same #instant# the firing began on the #other# #side# and the balls penetrated the #board# all round us
oh how noble did the grand vizier my #father# #look# at that #moment# in the midst of the flying bullets his scimitar in his #hand# and his #face# blackened with the powder of his #enemy# and how he terrified them even then and made them fly before him
$selim$ selim cried he guardian of the #fire# do your #duty# $selim$ is dead replied a #voice# which seemed to come from the depths of the #earth#
at the same #moment# an explosion was heard and the flooring of the #room# in which my #father# was sitting was suddenly torn up and shivered to atoms
and you are lost $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ the troops were firing from underneath three or four palikares fell with their #body# literally ploughed with wounds
my #father# howled aloud plunged his #finger# into the holes which the balls had made and tore up #one# of the planks entire
but immediately through this #opening# twenty more shots were fired and the flame rushing up like #fire# from the crater of a volcano soon reached the tapestry which it quickly devoured
in the midst of all this frightful tumult and these terrific #cry# two reports fearfully distinct followed by two shrieks more heartrending than all froze me with #terror#
these two shots had mortally wounded my #father# and it was he who had given utterance to these frightful #cry#
my #mother# tried to force the #door# that she might go and die with him but it was fastened on the inside
all around him were lying the palikares writhing in convulsive agonies while two or three who were only slightly wounded were trying to escape by springing from the #window#
at this crisis the whole flooring suddenly gave #way# my #father# fell on #one# knee and at the same #moment# twenty #hand# were thrust forth armed with sabres #pistol# and poniards
twenty blows were instantaneously directed against #one# #man# and my #father# disappeared in a whirlwind of #fire# and smoke kindled by these demons and which seemed like hell itself #opening# beneath his #foot#
however he remained standing clinging to a #window# i felt myself fall to the #ground# my #mother# had fainted
$haydée$ #arm# fell by her #side# and she uttered a deep groan at the same #time# looking towards the #count# as if to ask if he were satisfied with her obedience to his commands
$m_de_monte_cristo$ arose and approached her took her #hand# and said to her in romaic calm yourself my dear #child# and take courage in remembering that there is a god who #will# punish traitors
it is a frightful #story# #count# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ terrified at the paleness of $haydée$ #countenance# and i reproach myself now for having been so cruel and thoughtless in my request
oh it is #nothing# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ then patting the young #girl# on the #head# he continued $haydée$ is very courageous and she sometimes even finds consolation in the recital of her #misfortune#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ looked at her with curiosity for she had not yet related what he most desired to know how she had become the slave of the #count#
because my lord said $haydée$ eagerly my miseries recall to me the remembrance of your goodness $haydée$ saw at a #glance# the same #expression# pervading the #countenance# of her two auditors she continued
but spare the #honor# of the widow of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ it is not to me to whom you must address yourself said kourchid
when my #mother# recovered her senses we were before the seraskier kill said she to whom then to your new #master#
and kourchid pointed out #one# who had more than any contributed to the #death# of my #father# said $haydée$ in a #tone# of chastened anger
who and where is he he is here then said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ you became the property of this #man#
no replied $haydée$ he did not dare to keep us so we were sold to some slave merchants who were going to constantinople
they were surrounded by a crowd of #people# who opened a #way# for us to pass when suddenly my #mother# having looked closely at an object which was attracting their #attention# uttered a piercing #cry# and fell to the #ground# pointing as she did so to a #head# which was placed over the #gate# and beneath which were inscribed these #word#
we traversed greece and arrived #half# dead at the imperial #gate# this is the #head# of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ tepelini $ali_pasha_of_yanina$
i cried bitterly and tried to raise my #mother# from the #earth# but she was dead i was taken to the slave market and was purchased by a rich armenian
he caused me to be instructed gave me #master# and when i was thirteen #year# of #age# he sold me to the sultan mahmoud
of whom i bought her said $m_de_monte_cristo$ as i told you $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with the emerald which formed a match to the #one# i had made into a #box# for the #purpose# of holding my hashish pills
oh you are good you are great my lord said $haydée$ kissing the #count# #hand#
and i am very fortunate in belonging to such a #master# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ remained quite bewildered with all that he had seen and heard
come finish your cup of coffee said $m_de_monte_cristo$ the history is ended #chapter# we hear from $ali_pasha_of_yanina$
if $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ could have seen the trembling #step# and agitated #countenance# of $m_franz_de_quesnel$ when he quitted the #chamber# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ even she would have been constrained to #pity# him
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had only just given utterance to a few incoherent sentences and then retired to his #study# where he received about two #hour# afterwards the following #letter#
after all the disclosures which were made this #morning# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ must see the utter impossibility of any alliance being formed between his #family# and that of $m_franz_de_quesnel$ épinay
m épinay must say that he is shocked and astonished that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who appeared to be aware of all the #circumstance# detailed this #morning# should not have anticipated him in this announcement
no #one# who had seen the #magistrate# at this #moment# so thoroughly unnerved by the recent inauspicious combination of #circumstance# would have supposed for an #instant# that he had anticipated the annoyance although it certainly never had occurred to him that his #father# would carry candor or rather rudeness so far as to relate such a history
and in #justice# to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ it must be understood that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who never cared for the #opinion# of his #son# on any #subject# had always omitted to explain the #affair# to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ so that he had all his #life# entertained the belief that general $m_franz_de_quesnel$ or the #baron# épinay as he was alternately styled according as the speaker wished to identify him by his own #family# #name# or by the title which had been conferred on him fell the victim of assassination and not that he was killed fairly in a duel
this harsh #letter# coming as it did from a #man# generally so polite and respectful struck a mortal blow at the pride of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
the sudden departure of $m_franz_de_quesnel$ after being summoned by $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had so much astonished #everyone# that the #position# of #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ left alone with the #notary# and the witnesses became every #moment# more embarrassing
determined to bear it no longer she arose and left the #room# saying she would go and make some inquiries into the cause of his sudden disappearance
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ communications on the #subject# were very limited and concise he told her in #fact# that an explanation had taken #place# between $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ $m_franz_d_épinay$ and himself and that the #marriage# of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and $m_franz_de_quesnel$ would consequently be broken off
hardly had he read the #letter# when his #wife# entered this was an awkward and unpleasant #thing# to have to report to those who were waiting
she therefore contented herself with saying that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ having at the commencement of the discussion been attacked by a #sort# of apoplectic fit the #affair# would necessarily be deferred for some #day# longer
this news false as it was following so singularly in the train of the two similar #misfortune# which had so recently occurred evidently astonished the auditors and they retired without a #word#
during this #time# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ at once terrified and happy after having embraced and thanked the feeble old #man# for thus breaking with a single blow the chain which she had been accustomed to consider as irrefragable asked leave to retire to her own #room# in #order# to recover her composure
but instead of going to her own #room# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ having once gained her #liberty# entered the gallery and #opening# a small #door# at the #end# of it found herself at once in the #garden#
in the midst of all the strange #event# which had crowded #one# on the #other# an indefinable sentiment of dread had taken #possession# of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #mind#
she expected every #moment# that she should see $m_maximilian_morrel$ appear pale and trembling to forbid the signing of the contract like the laird of ravenswood in the bride of lammermoor
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looked the permission which she solicited it was high #time# for her to make her #appearance# at the #gate# for $m_maximilian_morrel$ had long awaited her coming
he had #half# guessed what was going on when he saw $m_franz_de_quesnel$ quit the cemetery with $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ he followed $m_franz_d_épinay$ saw him enter afterwards go out and then re enter with $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and $baron_de_château_renaud$
he had no longer any #doubt# as to the #nature# of the conference he therefore quickly went to the #gate# in the clover patch prepared to hear the result of the proceedings and very certain that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ would hasten to him the first #moment# she should be set at #liberty#
he was not mistaken peering through the crevices of the wooden partition he soon discovered the young #girl# who cast aside all her usual precautions and walked at once to the barrier
the first #glance# which $m_maximilian_morrel$ directed towards her entirely reassured him and the first #word# she spoke made his #heart# bound with delight
we are saved said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ saved repeated $m_maximilian_morrel$ not being able to conceive such intense #happiness# by whom
$m_maximilian_morrel$ swore to #love# him with all his soul and at that #moment# he could safely #promise# to do so for he felt as though it were not enough to #love# him merely as a #friend# or even as a #father# he worshiped him as a god
by my #grandfather# oh $m_maximilian_morrel$ pray #love# him for all his goodness to us but tell me $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ how has it all been effected
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was on the #point# of relating all that had passed but she suddenly remembered that in doing so she must reveal a terrible #secret# which concerned #other# as well as her #grandfather# and she said
what strange #mean# has he used to compass this blessed #end# at some future #time# i #will# tell you all about it
the #conversation# had now turned upon a topic so pleasing to $m_maximilian_morrel$ that he was ready to accede to #anything# that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #thought# fit to propose and he likewise felt that a #piece# of intelligence such as he just heard ought to be more than sufficient to content him for #one# #day#
but when #will# that be when i am your #wife# however he would not leave without the #promise# of seeing $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ again the next #night#
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ promised all that $m_maximilian_morrel$ required of her and certainly it was less difficult now for her to believe that she should marry $m_maximilian_morrel$ than it was an #hour# ago to assure herself that she should not marry $m_franz_de_quesnel$
during the #time# occupied by the interview we have just detailed #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had gone to #visit# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the old #man# looked at her with that stern and forbidding #expression# with which he was accustomed to receive her
it is superfluous for me to tell you that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #marriage# is broken off since it was here that the #affair# was concluded
but #one# #thing# i can tell you of which i do not think you are aware that is that i have always been opposed to this #marriage# and that the contract was entered into entirely without my consent or approbation
#sir# said she $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #countenance# remained immovable $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ regarded his #daughter# in #law# with the #look# of a #man# desiring an explanation
now that this #marriage# which i know you so much disliked is done away with i come to you on an errand which neither $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ nor $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ could consistently undertake
i come to entreat you #sir# continued #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ as the only #one# who has the #right# of doing so inasmuch as i am the only #one# who #will# receive no personal benefit from the transaction i come to entreat you to restore not your #love# for that she has always possessed but to restore your #fortune# to your granddaughter
there was a doubtful #expression# in $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #eye# he was evidently trying to discover the motive of this proceeding and he could not succeed in doing so
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #eye# demanded the #nature# of her mission may i #hope# #sir# said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ that your intentions accord with my request
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ made a #sign# that they did in that #case# #sir# rejoined #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i #will# leave you overwhelmed with gratitude and #happiness# at your prompt acquiescence to my #wish#
the next #day# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ sent for the #notary# the first #will# was torn up and a second made in which he left the whole of his #fortune# to $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ on condition that she should never be separated from him
it was then generally reported that $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the heiress of the marquis and marchioness of $madame_de_saint_méran$ had regained the good graces of her #grandfather# and that she would ultimately be in #possession# of an income of livres
while all the proceedings relative to the dissolution of the #marriage# contract were being carried on at the $house_of_peers$ of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ $m_de_monte_cristo$ had paid his #visit# to the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who in #order# to lose no #time# in responding to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #wish# and at the same #time# to pay all due deference to his #position# in society donned his uniform of lieutenant general which he ornamented with all his crosses and thus attired ordered his finest #horse# and drove to the rue de la chaussée antin
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was balancing his monthly #account# and it was perhaps not the most favorable #moment# for finding him in his best humor
she then bowed to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and retired at the first #sight# of his old #friend# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ assumed his majestic #air# and settled himself in his easy #chair#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ usually so stiff and formal accosted the #banker# in an affable and smiling #manner# and #feeling# sure that the overture he was about to make would be well received he did not consider it necessary to adopt any manœuvres in #order# to gain his #end# but went at once straight to the #point#
well #baron# said he here i am at last some #time# has elapsed since our #plan# were formed and they are not yet executed
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ paused at these #word# quietly waiting till the cloud should have dispersed which had gathered on the #brow# of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and which he attributed to his #silence# but on the #contrary# to his great surprise it grew darker and darker
to what do you allude $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ as if he were trying in vain to guess at the possible meaning of the general #word#
i see you are a stickler for forms my dear #sir# and you would remind me that the ceremonial rites should not be omitted
i beg your pardon but as i have but #one# #son# and it is the first #time# i have ever #thought# of marrying him i am still serving my apprenticeship you know come i #will# reform
ah said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ ma foi and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with a forced #smile# arose and making a low bow to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said
#baron# i have the #honor# of asking of you the #hand# of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ for my #son# the vicomte $m_albert_de_morcerf$
but $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ instead of receiving this address in the favorable #manner# which $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had expected knit his #brow# and without inviting the #count# who was still standing to take a #seat# he said
to reflect said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ more and more astonished have you not had enough #time# for reflection during the eight #year# which have elapsed since this #marriage# was first discussed between us
#count# said the #banker# #thing# are constantly occurring in the #world# to induce us to lay aside our most established #opinion# or at all #event# to cause us to remodel them according to the change of #circumstance# which may have placed #affair# in a totally different #light# to that in which we at first viewed them
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ it #will# be necessary to reflect before i give you an #answer# i do not understand you #baron# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
what i #mean# to say is this #sir# that during the last fortnight unforeseen #circumstance# have occurred excuse me said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
but is it a play we are acting a play yes for it is like #one# pray
let us come more to the #point# and endeavor thoroughly to understand each #other# that is quite my #desire#
you have seen de $m_de_monte_cristo$ have you not i see him very often said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #drawing# himself up
well in #one# of your late #conversation# with him you said that i appeared to be forgetful and irresolute concerning this #marriage#
he is a particular #friend# of mine did you not i did say so
well here i am proving at once that i am really neither the #one# nor the #other# by entreating you to keep your #promise# on that score
have you so soon changed your #mind# added $m_albert_de_morcerf$ or have you only provoked my request that you may have the #pleasure# of seeing me humbled
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ seeing that if he continued the #conversation# in the same #tone# in which he had begun it the whole #thing# might #turn# out to his own disadvantage turned to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and said
#count# you must doubtless be surprised at my reserve and i assure you it costs me much to act in such a #manner# towards you but believe me when i say that imperative necessity has imposed the painful task upon me
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ did not #answer# these are all so many empty #word# my dear #sir# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
they might satisfy a new acquaintance but the comte de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ does not rank in that list and when a #man# like him comes to another recalls to him his plighted #word# and this #man# fails to redeem the pledge he has at least a #right# to exact from him a good #reason# for so doing
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was a coward but did not #wish# to appear so he was piqued at the #tone# which $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had just assumed
i am not without a good #reason# for my conduct replied the #banker# what do you #mean# to say
i #mean# to say that i have a good #reason# but that it is difficult to explain
you must be aware at all #event# that it is impossible for me to understand motives before they are explained to me but #one# #thing# at least is clear which is that you decline allying yourself with my #family#
and do you really flatter yourself that i shall yield to all your caprices and quietly and humbly await the #time# of again being received into your good graces
no #sir# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i merely suspend my decision that is all then #count# if you #will# not wait we must #look# upon these projects as if they had never been entertained
the #count# bit his #lip# till the #blood# almost started to prevent the ebullition of anger which his proud and irritable temper scarcely allowed him to restrain understanding however that in the present state of #thing# the laugh would decidedly be against him he turned from the #door# towards which he had been directing his #step# and again confronted the #banker#
a cloud settled on his #brow# evincing decided anxiety and uneasiness instead of the #expression# of offended pride which had lately reigned there
my dear $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ we have been acquainted for many #year# and consequently we ought to make some allowance for each #other# failings
you owe me an explanation and really it is but fair that i should know what #circumstance# has occurred to deprive my #son# of your favor
it is from no personal ill #feeling# towards the viscount that is all i can say #sir# replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who resumed his insolent #manner# as soon as he perceived that $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was a little softened and calmed down
and towards whom do you bear this personal ill #feeling# then said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ turning pale with anger
#face# had not remained unperceived by the #banker# he fixed on him a #look# of greater assurance than before and said
a tremor of suppressed rage shook the whole frame of the #count# and making a violent #effort# over himself he said
the #expression# of the #count# you may perhaps be better satisfied that i should not go farther into particulars i have a #right# to insist on your giving me an explanation
is it #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who has displeased you is it my #fortune# which you find insufficient is it because my #opinion# differ from yours
if such had been the #case# i only should have been to blame inasmuch as i was aware of all these #thing# when i made the engagement
i really am quite ashamed to have been the cause of your undergoing such severe self examination let us drop the #subject# and adopt the middle #course# of delay which implies neither a rupture nor an engagement
#nothing# of the kind #sir# replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ no do not seek any longer to discover the #reason# ma foi there is no hurry
while we wait #time# #will# be progressing #event# #will# succeed each #other# #thing# which in the #evening# #look# dark and obscure appear but too clearly in the #light# of #morning# and sometimes the utterance of #one# #word# or the lapse of a single #day# #will# reveal the most cruel calumnies
my #daughter# is only seventeen #year# old and your #son# twenty #one# calumnies did you say #sir# cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$ turning livid with rage
does #anyone# dare to slander me $monsieur_cavalcanti$ i told you that i considered it best to avoid all explanation
yes #sir# although i assure you the refusal is as painful for me to give as it is for you to receive for i had reckoned on the #honor# of your alliance and the breaking off of a #marriage# contract always injures the #lady# more than the #gentleman#
then #sir# i am patiently to submit to your refusal enough #sir# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ we #will# speak no more on the #subject#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ observed that during the whole #conversation# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had never once dared to ask if it was on his own #account# that $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ recalled his #word#
that #evening# he had a long conference with several #friend# and $monsieur_cavalcanti$ who had remained in the #drawing# #room# with the #lady# was the last to leave the #banker# $house_of_peers$
the next #morning# as soon as he awoke $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ asked for the newspapers they were brought to him he laid aside three or four and at last fixed on impartial the #paper# of which $m_beauchamp$ was the chief editor
he hastily tore off the cover opened the journal with nervous precipitation passed contemptuously over the paris jottings and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence stopped with a malicious #smile# at a paragraph headed we hear from $ali_pasha_of_yanina$
very good observed $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ after having read the paragraph here is a little article on colonel $m_fernand_mondego$ which if i am not mistaken would render the explanation which the comte de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ required of me perfectly unnecessary
at the same #moment# that is at nine clock in the #morning# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ dressed in a black coat buttoned up to his chin might have been seen walking with a quick and agitated #step# in the direction of $m_de_monte_cristo$ $house_of_peers$ in the champs élysées
when he presented himself at the #gate# the porter informed him that the #count# had gone out about #half# an #hour# previously
and clutching his gloves in anger he left the #apartment# did he take $monsieur_baptistin$ with him
no my lord call him then i #wish# to speak to him the concierge went to seek the #valet# de chambre and returned with him in an #instant#
i beg pardon for my intrusion but i was anxious to know from your own mouth if your #master# was really out or not
my good #friend# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he is really out #sir# replied $monsieur_baptistin$ out even to me
i know how happy my #master# always is to receive the vicomte said $monsieur_baptistin$ and i should therefore never think of including him in any general #order#
you are #right# and now i #wish# to see him on an #affair# of great importance do you think it #will# be long before he comes in
well i #will# go and take a #turn# in the champs élysées and at ten clock i #will# #return# here meanwhile if the #count# should come in #will# you beg him not to go out again without seeing me
no i think not for he ordered his breakfast at ten clock you may depend on my doing so #sir# said $monsieur_baptistin$
as he was passing the allée des veuves he #thought# he saw the #count# #horse# standing at gosset shooting gallery he approached and soon recognized the coachman
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ left the cab in which he had come at the #count# #door# intending to take a #turn# on #foot#
is the #count# shooting in the gallery said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ yes #sir# replied the coachman while he was speaking $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had heard the report of two or three #pistol# shots
he entered and on his #way# met the waiter excuse me my lord said the lad but #will# you have the kindness to wait a #moment#
what for philip asked $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who being a constant visitor there did not understand this opposition to his entrance
because the #person# who is now in the gallery prefers being alone and never practices in the #presence# of #anyone#
not even before you philip then who loads his #pistol# his #servant# a nubian
a negro it is he then do you know this #gentleman# yes and i am come to #look# for him he is a #friend# of mine
oh that is quite another #thing# then i #will# go immediately and inform him of your arrival and philip urged by his own curiosity entered the gallery a second afterwards $m_de_monte_cristo$ appeared on the threshold
i ask your pardon my dear #count# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ for following you here and i must first tell you that it was not the fault of your #servant# that i did so i alone am to blame for the indiscretion
i went to your $house_of_peers$ and they told me you were out but that they expected you home at ten clock to breakfast
i was walking about in #order# to pass away the #time# till ten clock when i caught #sight# of your #carriage# and #horse#
what you have just said induces me to #hope# that you intend breakfasting with me no #thank# you i am thinking of #other# #thing# besides breakfast just now
perhaps we may take that meal at a later #hour# and in worse company what on #earth# are you talking of
i am to fight #today# for what for the sake of fighting yes i understand that but what is the quarrel
#people# fight for all #sort# of #reason# you know i fight in the cause of #honor# ah that is #something# serious
so serious that i come to beg you to render me a #service# what is it
that is a serious #matter# and we #will# not discuss it here let us speak of #nothing# till we get home
the #count# turned up his sleeves and passed into the little vestibule where the #gentleman# were accustomed to wash their #hand# after shooting
to be my second $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ bring me some #water# come in my lord said philip in a low #tone#
and i #will# show you #something# droll $m_albert_de_morcerf$ entered and in #place# of the usual target he saw some playing cards fixed against the #wall#
at a #distance# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #thought# it was a complete suit for he counted from the ace to the ten ah ha said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
i see you were preparing for a game of cards no said the #count# i was making a suit
those are really aces and twos which you see but my shots have turned them into threes fives sevens eights nines and tens
in #fact# the bullets had actually pierced the cards in the exact #place# which the painted #sign# would otherwise have occupied the #line# and #distance# being as regularly kept as if they had been ruled with pencil
in going up to the target $m_albert_de_morcerf$ picked up two or three swallows that had been rash enough to come within the range of the #count# #pistol#
what would you have my dear viscount said $m_de_monte_cristo$ wiping his #hand# on the towel which $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ had brought him
how said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ albert approached diable said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i must occupy my leisure #moment# in some #way# or #other#
but come i am waiting for you both #man# entered $m_de_monte_cristo$ #carriage# which in the #course# of a few #minute# deposited them safely at no
$m_de_monte_cristo$ took $m_albert_de_morcerf$ into his #study# and pointing to a #seat# placed another for himself now let us talk the #matter# over quietly said the #count#
you see i am perfectly composed said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with whom are you going to fight with $m_beauchamp$
#one# of your #friend# of #course# it is always with #friend# that #one# fights i suppose you have some cause of quarrel
i have what has he done to you there appeared in his journal last #night# but wait and read for yourself
and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ handed over the #paper# to the #count# who read as follows a correspondent at $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ informs us of a #fact# of which until now we had remained in ignorance
the castle which formed the protection of the town was given up to the turks by a french #officer# named $m_fernand_mondego$ in whom the grand vizier $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ tepelini had reposed the greatest confidence
well said $m_de_monte_cristo$ what do you see in that to annoy you what do i see in it
yes what does it signify to you if the castle of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ was given up by a french #officer#
it signifies to my #father# the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ whose christian #name# is $m_fernand_mondego$ did your #father# serve under $ali_pasha_of_yanina$
yes that is to say he fought for the independence of the greeks and hence arises the calumny
now just tell me who the devil should know in france that the #officer# $m_fernand_mondego$ and the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ are #one# and the same #person#
oh my dear viscount do talk #reason# i do not #desire# to do otherwise and who #care# now about $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ which was taken as long ago as the #year# or
they have allowed all this #time# to elapse and then all of a sudden rake up #event# which have been forgotten to furnish materials for scandal in #order# to tarnish the lustre of our high #position#
that just shows the meanness of this slander i inherit my #father# #name# and i do not choose that the #shadow# of disgrace should darken it
i am going to $m_beauchamp$ in whose journal this paragraph appears and i shall insist on his retracting the assertion before two witnesses
no you #will# not for he #will# tell you what is very true that perhaps there were fifty #officer# in the greek army bearing the same #name#
$m_beauchamp$ #will# never retract then we must fight we #will# fight nevertheless i #will# efface that blot on my #father#
character my #father# who was such a brave #soldier# whose career was so brilliant oh well he #will# add
we are warranted in believing that this $m_fernand_mondego$ is not the illustrious #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who also bears the same christian #name#
i am determined not to be content with #anything# short of an entire retractation and you intend to make him do it in the #presence# of two witnesses do you
yes you do wrong which #mean# i suppose that you refuse the #service# which i asked of you
you know my theory regarding duels i told you my #opinion# on that #subject# if you remember when we were at rome
nevertheless my dear #count# i found you this #morning# engaged in an occupation but little consistent with the notions you profess to entertain
because my dear #fellow# you understand #one# must never be eccentric if #one# lot is cast among fools it is necessary to #study# folly
i shall perhaps find myself #one# #day# called out by some harebrained scamp who has no more real cause of quarrel with me than you have with $m_beauchamp$ he may take me to task for some foolish trifle or #other# he #will# bring his witnesses or #will# insult me in some public #place# and i am expected to kill him for all that
you admit that you would fight then well if so why do you object to my doing so
i do not say that you ought not to fight i only say that a duel is a serious #thing# and ought not to be undertaken without due reflection
did he reflect before he insulted my #father# if he spoke hastily and owns that he did so you ought to be satisfied
ah my dear #count# you are far too indulgent and you are far too exacting supposing for instance and do not be angry at what i am going to say
well supposing the assertion to be really true a #son# ought not to submit to such a stain on his #father# #honor#
ma foi we live in #time# when there is much to which we must submit that is precisely the fault of the #age#
and do you undertake to reform it yes as far as i am personally concerned well you are indeed exacting my dear #fellow#
yes i own it are you quite impervious to good advice not when it comes from a #friend#
and do you #account# me that title certainly i do well then before going to $m_beauchamp$ with your witnesses seek further information on the #subject#
from whom from $haydée$ why what can be the #use# of mixing a #woman# up in the #affair# what
she can declare to you for example that your #father# had no #hand# whatever in the defeat and #death# of the vizier or if by #chance# he had indeed the #misfortune# to
can she do in it i have told you my dear #count# that i would not for #one# #moment# admit of such a proposition
you reject this #mean# of information then i do most decidedly then let me offer #one# more #word# of advice
do so then but let it be the last you do not #wish# to hear it perhaps
on the #contrary# i request it do not take any witnesses with you when you go to $m_beauchamp$ #visit# him alone
that would be #contrary# to all custom your #case# is not an ordinary #one# and what is your #reason# for advising me to go alone
because then the #affair# #will# #rest# between you and $m_beauchamp$ explain yourself i #will# do so
if $m_beauchamp$ be disposed to retract you ought at least to give him the opportunity of doing it of his own free #will# the satisfaction to you #will# be the same
if on the #contrary# he refuses to do so it #will# then be quite #time# enough to admit two #stranger# into your #secret#
they #will# not be #stranger# they #will# be #friend# ah but the #friend# of #today# are the #enemy# of #tomorrow# $m_beauchamp$ for instance
so you recommend i recommend you to be prudent then you advise me to go alone to $m_beauchamp$
when you #wish# to obtain some concession from a #man# self #love# you must avoid even the #appearance# of wishing to wound it
i do and i #will# tell you why i believe you are #right# i am glad of it
then i #will# go alone go but you would do better still by not going at all
that is impossible do so then it #will# be a wiser #plan# than the first which you proposed
but if in #spite# of all my precautions i am at last obliged to fight #will# you not be my second
my dear viscount said $m_de_monte_cristo$ gravely you must have seen before #today# that at all #time# and in all #place# i have been at your disposal but the #service# which you have just demanded of me is #one# which it is out of my #power# to render you
perhaps you may know at some future period and in the #mean# #time# i request you to excuse my declining to put you in #possession# of my #reason#
why well i #will# have $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and $baron_de_château_renaud$ they #will# be the very #man# for it
but if i do fight you #will# surely not object to giving me a lesson or two in shooting and fencing
do so then that too is impossible what a singular being you are you #will# not interfere in #anything#
you are #right# that is the principle on which i #wish# to act we #will# say no more about it then
he found his #carriage# at the #door# and doing his utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find $m_beauchamp$ who was in his office
good bye #count# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ took his hat and left the #room# it was a gloomy dusty looking #apartment# such as journalists offices have always been from #time# immemorial
$m_beauchamp$ repeated the #name# to himself as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright and then gave #order# for him to be admitted
$m_beauchamp$ uttered an exclamation of surprise on seeing his #friend# leap over and trample under #foot# all the newspapers which were strewed about the #room#
the #servant# announced $m_albert_de_morcerf$ $m_albert_de_morcerf$ entered this #way# this #way# my dear $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said he holding out his #hand# to the young #man#
are you out of your senses or do you come peaceably to take breakfast with me try and find a #seat#
there is #one# by that geranium which is the only #thing# in the #room# to remind me that there are #other# leaves in the #world# besides leaves of #paper#
$m_beauchamp$ said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ it is of your journal that i come to speak indeed what do you #wish# to say about it
i #desire# that a statement contained in it should be rectified to what do you refer but pray sit down
#thank# you said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with a cold and formal bow #will# you now have the kindness to explain the #nature# of the statement which has displeased you
an announcement has been made which implicates the #honor# of a member of my #family# what is it said $m_beauchamp$ much surprised surely you must be mistaken
the #story# sent you from $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ yanina yes really you appear to be totally ignorant of the cause which brings me here
such is really the #case# i assure you upon my #honor# baptiste give me #yesterday# #paper# cried $m_beauchamp$
here i have brought mine with me replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ $m_beauchamp$ took the #paper# and read the article to which $m_albert_de_morcerf$ pointed in an undertone
you see it is a serious annoyance said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ when $m_beauchamp$ had finished the perusal of the paragraph is the #officer# referred to a relation of yours then demanded the journalist
yes said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ blushing well what do you #wish# me to do for you said $m_beauchamp$ mildly my dear $m_beauchamp$ i #wish# you to contradict this statement
come said he this #matter# #will# want a good deal of talking over a retractation is always a serious #thing# you know
$m_beauchamp$ looked at $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with a benevolent #expression# sit down and i #will# read it again $m_albert_de_morcerf$ resumed his #seat# and $m_beauchamp$ read with more #attention# than at first the #line# denounced by his #friend#
well said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in a determined #tone# you see that your #paper# has insulted a member of my #family# and i insist on a retractation being made
you insist yes i insist permit me to remind you that you are not in the #chamber# my dear viscount
nor do i #wish# to be there replied the young #man# rising i repeat that i am determined to have the announcement of #yesterday# contradicted
you have known me long enough continued $m_albert_de_morcerf$ biting his #lip# convulsively for he saw that $m_beauchamp$ anger was beginning to rise you
have been my #friend# and therefore sufficiently intimate with me to be aware that i am likely to maintain my resolution on this #point#
if i have been your #friend# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ your present #manner# of speaking would almost lead me to forget that i ever bore that title
but wait a #moment# do not let us get angry or at least not yet you are irritated and vexed tell me how this $m_fernand_mondego$ is related to you
he is merely my #father# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ $m_fernand_mondego$ #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ an old #soldier# who has fought in twenty battles and
whose honorable scars they would denounce as badges of disgrace is it your #father# said $m_beauchamp$
i #will# #look# at it again and he read the paragraph for the third #time# laying a stress on each #word# as he proceeded
that is quite another #thing# then i can well understand your indignation my dear $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but the #paper# nowhere identifies this $m_fernand_mondego$ with your #father#
no but the connection #will# be seen by #other# and therefore i #will# have the article contradicted
at the #word# i #will# $m_beauchamp$ steadily raised his #eye# to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #countenance# and then as gradually lowering them he remained thoughtful for a few #moment#
you #will# retract this assertion #will# you not $m_beauchamp$ said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with increased though stifled anger yes replied $m_beauchamp$
immediately said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ when i am convinced that the statement is false what the #thing# is worth looking into and i #will# take pains to investigate the #matter# thoroughly
if you do not believe that it is my #father# say so immediately and if on the #contrary# you believe it to be him state your #reason# for doing so
$m_beauchamp$ looked at $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with the #smile# which was so peculiar to him and which in its numerous modifications served to express every varied #emotion# of his #mind#
#sir# replied he if you came to me with the #idea# of demanding satisfaction you should have gone at once to the #point# and not have entertained me with the idle #conversation# to which i have been patiently listening for the last #half# #hour#
but what is there to investigate #sir# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ enraged beyond measure at $m_beauchamp$ last remark am i to put this construction on your #visit#
if you please $m_fernand_mondego$ vicomte de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i never allow them from my #enemy# and therefore shall not put up with them from my #friend#
you insist on my contradicting the article relating to general $m_fernand_mondego$ an article with which i assure you on my #word# of #honor# i had #nothing# whatever to do
yes if you #will# not consent to retract that infamous calumny wait a #moment# no threats
yes i insist on it said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ whose #mind# was beginning to get bewildered with the excitement of his #feeling#
and if i refuse to retract you #wish# to fight do you said $m_beauchamp$ in a calm #tone# yes replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ raising his #voice#
i was not even aware of it but you have by the #step# you have taken called my #attention# to the paragraph in #question# and it #will# remain until it shall be either contradicted or confirmed by someone who has a #right# to do so
well said $m_beauchamp$ here is my #answer# my dear #sir# the article was not inserted by me
i #will# do myself the #honor# of sending my seconds to you and you #will# be kind enough to arrange with them the #place# of meeting and the weapons
#sir# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ rising certainly my dear #sir# and this #evening# if you please or #tomorrow# at the latest we #will# meet
no no i #will# be on the #ground# at the proper #time# but in my #opinion# and i have a #right# to dictate the preliminaries as it is i who have received the provocation in my #opinion# the #time# ought not to be yet
i know you to be well skilled in the management of the sword while i am only moderately so i know too that you are a good marksman
i know that a duel between us two would be a serious #affair# because you are brave and i am brave also
there we are about equal i do not therefore #wish# either to kill you or to be killed myself without a cause
do you insist on this retractation so far as to kill me if i do not make it although i have repeated more than once and affirmed on my #honor# that i was ignorant of the #thing# with which you charge me and although i still declare that it is impossible for #anyone# but you to recognize the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ under the #name# of $m_fernand_mondego$
now i am going to put a #question# to you and #one# very much to the #purpose# too i maintain my original resolution
very well my dear #sir# then i consent to cut throats with you but i require three weeks preparation at the #end# of that #time# i shall come and say to you
the assertion is true when i shall immediately draw the sword from its sheath or the #pistol# from the #case# whichever you please
the assertion is false and i retract it or three weeks cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$ they #will# pass as slowly as three centuries when i am all the #time# suffering dishonor
had you continued to remain on amicable terms with me i should have said patience my #friend# but you have constituted yourself my #enemy# therefore i say what does that signify to me #sir#
but remember at the expiration of that #time# no delay or subterfuge #will# justify you in $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said $m_beauchamp$ rising in his #turn#
well let it be three weeks then said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i cannot throw you out of #window# for three weeks that is to say for twenty four #day# to come
#today# is the th of august the st of september #will# therefore be the conclusion of the term agreed on and till that #time# arrives and it is the advice of a #gentleman# which i am about to give you
nor have you any #right# to split my skull open till that #time# has elapsed till then we #will# refrain from growling and barking like two dogs chained within #sight# of each #other#
when he had concluded his speech $m_beauchamp$ bowed coldly to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ turned his back upon him and went to the press #room#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ vented his anger on a pile of newspapers which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick after which ebullition he departed not however without walking several #time# to the #door# of the press #room# as if he had #half# a #mind# to enter
while $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was lashing the front of his #carriage# in the same #manner# that he had the newspapers which were the innocent agents of his discomfiture as he was crossing the barrier he perceived $m_maximilian_morrel$ who was walking with a quick #step# and a bright #eye#
he was passing the chinese baths and appeared to have come from the direction of the porte saint martin and to be going towards the madeleine
ah said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ there goes a happy #man# and it so happened $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was not mistaken in his #opinion#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had just sent for him and he was in such haste to know the #reason# of his doing so that he had not stopped to take a cab placing infinitely more dependence on his own two legs than on the four legs of a cab #horse#
he had therefore set off at a furious rate from the rue meslay and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of the $faubourg_saint_honoré$
#chapter# the lemonade $m_maximilian_morrel$ was in #fact# very happy $m_maximilian_morrel$ advanced with a firm manly tread and poor $barrois$ followed him as he best might
$m_maximilian_morrel$ was only thirty #one# $barrois$ was sixty #year# of #age# $m_maximilian_morrel$ was deeply in #love# and $barrois$ was dying with heat and exertion
these two #man# thus opposed in #age# and #interest# resembled two #part# of a triangle presenting the extremes of separation yet nevertheless possessing their #point# of union
this #point# of union was $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and it was he who had just sent for $m_maximilian_morrel$ with the request that the latter would lose no #time# in coming to him
on arriving at the $house_of_peers$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ was not even out of breath for #love# lends wings to our #desire# but $barrois$ who had long forgotten what it was to #love# was sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to #use#
the old #servant# introduced $m_maximilian_morrel$ by a private entrance closed the #door# of the #study# and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
she looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress and $m_maximilian_morrel$ experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the #conversation# of her #grandfather#
but the easy #chair# of the old #man# was heard rolling along the #floor# and he soon made his #appearance# in the #room#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ acknowledged by a #look# of extreme kindness and benevolence the #thank# which $m_maximilian_morrel$ lavished on him for his timely intervention on behalf of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and himself an intervention which had saved them from #despair#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ then cast on the invalid an interrogative #look# as to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him
a command which $m_maximilian_morrel$ obeyed to the #letter# to the great discomfiture of $barrois$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was sitting at a little #distance# from them timidly awaiting the #moment# when she should be obliged to speak
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ fixed his #eye# on her am i to say what you told me asked $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ made a #sign# that she was to do so
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ to the young #man# who was regarding her with the most intense #interest# my #grandfather# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had a thousand #thing# to say which he told me three #day# ago and now he has sent for you that i may repeat them to you
i #will# repeat them then and since he has chosen me as his interpreter i #will# be faithful to the trust and #will# not alter a #word# of his intentions
oh i am listening with the greatest impatience replied the young #man# speak i beg of you
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ cast down her #eye# this was a good omen for $m_maximilian_morrel$ for he knew that #nothing# but #happiness# could have the #power# of thus overcoming $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
my #grandfather# intends leaving this $house_of_peers$ said she and $barrois$ is looking out for suitable #apartment# for him in another
but you $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ you who are necessary to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #happiness# i interrupted $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ i shall not leave my #grandfather# that
now $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ must either give his consent to this #plan# or his refusal in the first #case# i shall leave directly and in the second i shall wait till i am of #age# which #will# be in about ten #month#
is an understood #thing# between us my #apartment# #will# be close to his then i shall be free i shall have an independent #fortune#
and and what demanded $m_maximilian_morrel$ and with my #grandfather# consent i shall fulfil the #promise# which i have made you
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ pronounced these last few #word# in such a low #tone# that #nothing# but $m_maximilian_morrel$ intense #interest# in what she was saying could have enabled him to hear them
once under my #grandfather# roof $m_maximilian_morrel$ can #visit# me in the #presence# of my good and worthy protector if we still feel that the union we contemplated #will# be likely to insure our future comfort and #happiness# in that #case# i shall expect $m_maximilian_morrel$ to come and claim me at my own #hand#
but alas i have heard it said that #heart# inflamed by obstacles to their #desire# grew cold in #time# of security i trust we shall never find it so in our experience
have i not explained your #wish# grandpapa said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ addressing $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ yes looked the old #man#
oh cried $m_maximilian_morrel$ almost tempted to throw himself on his knees before $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and to adore them as two superior beings what have i ever done in my #life# to merit such unbounded #happiness#
until that #time# continued the young #girl# in a calm and self possessed #tone# of #voice# we #will# conform to #circumstance# and be guided by the #wish# of our #friend# so long as those #wish# do not tend finally to separate us in a #word# and i repeat it because it expresses all i #wish# to convey we #will# wait
and i swear to make all the sacrifices which this #word# imposes #sir# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ not only with resignation but with cheerfulness
therefore continued $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ looking playfully at $m_maximilian_morrel$ no more inconsiderate actions no more rash projects for you surely would not #wish# to compromise #one# who from this #day# regards herself as destined honorably and happily to bear your #name#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ regarded the lovers with a #look# of ineffable tenderness while $barrois$ who had remained in the #room# in the character of a #man# privileged to know #everything# that passed smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald #forehead#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ looked obedience to her commands how hot you #look# my good $barrois$ said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
ah i have been running very fast $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ but i must do $m_maximilian_morrel$ the #justice# to say that he ran still faster
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ directed their #attention# to a waiter on which was placed a decanter containing lemonade and a #glass# the decanter was nearly full with the exception of a little which had been already drunk by $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
come $barrois$ said the young #girl# take some of this lemonade i see you are coveting a good draught of it
i am dying with thirst and since you are so kind as to offer it me i cannot say i should at all object to drinking your health in a #glass# of it
$barrois$ took away the waiter and hardly was he outside the #door# which in his haste he forgot to shut than they saw him throw back his #head# and empty to the very dregs the #glass# which $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had filled
the #fact# is $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said $barrois$ take some then and come back immediately $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and $m_maximilian_morrel$ were exchanging their adieux in the #presence# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ when a ring was heard at the #door# bell
it was the signal of a #visit# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ looked at her watch it is past noon said she and #today# is saturday
i dare say it is the #doctor# grandpapa $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looked his conviction that she was #right# in her supposition
he #will# come in here and $m_maximilian_morrel$ had better go do you not think so grandpapa yes signed the old #man#
$barrois$ cried $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ $barrois$ i am coming $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ replied he $barrois$ #will# open the #door# for you said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ addressing $m_maximilian_morrel$
and now remember #one# #thing# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ #officer# that my #grandfather# commands you not to take any rash or ill advised #step# which would be likely to compromise our #happiness#
i promised him to wait replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ and i #will# wait at this #moment# $barrois$ entered
who rang asked $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #doctor# avrigny said $barrois$ staggering as if he would fall what is the #matter# $barrois$ said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
the old #man# did not #answer# but looked at his #master# with wild staring #eye# while with his cramped #hand# he grasped a #piece# of furniture to enable him to stand upright
the rigors which had attacked $barrois$ gradually increased the #feature# of the #face# became quite altered and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ seeing $barrois$ in this pitiable condition showed by his #look# all the various #emotion# of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the #heart# of #man#
he is going to fall cried $m_maximilian_morrel$ $barrois$ made some #step# towards his #master# ah #sir# said he tell me what is the #matter# with me
i am suffering i cannot see a thousand fiery darts are piercing my brain ah dont touch me pray dont
by this #time# his haggard #eye# had the #appearance# of being ready to start from their sockets his #head# fell back and the lower extremities of the #body# began to stiffen
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ uttered a #cry# of horror $m_maximilian_morrel$ took her in his #arm# as if to defend her from some unknown danger
$barrois$ turned round and with a great #effort# stumbled a few #step# then fell at the #foot# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and resting his #hand# on the knee of the invalid exclaimed
$m_d_avrigny$ d avrigny cried she in a stifled #voice# help help my #master# my good #master# at this #moment# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ attracted by the #noise# appeared on the threshold
$m_maximilian_morrel$ relaxed his hold of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and retreating to a distant #corner# of the #room# remained #half# hidden behind a curtain
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ burning with impatience and #terror# was in #despair# at his utter inability to help his old domestic whom he regarded more in the #light# of a #friend# than a #servant#
#one# might by the fearful swelling of the veins of his #forehead# and the contraction of the muscles round the #eye# trace the terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic #mind# and the inanimate and helpless #body#
$barrois$ his #feature# convulsed his #eye# suffused with #blood# and his #head# thrown back was lying at full #length# beating the #floor# with his #hand# while his legs had become so stiff that they looked as if they would break rather than bend
pale as if he had been gazing on a serpent he fixed his terrified #eye# on the agonized sufferer a slight #appearance# of foam was visible around the mouth and he breathed painfully and with extreme difficulty
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ seemed stupefied with #astonishment# and remained gazing intently on the #scene# before him without uttering a #word# he had not seen $m_maximilian_morrel$
after a #moment# of dumb contemplation during which his #face# became pale and his #hair# seemed to stand on #end# he sprang towards the #door# crying out
#doctor# #doctor# come instantly pray come #madame# madame cried $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ calling her #step# #mother# and running upstairs to meet her
come quick quick and bring your bottle of smelling salts with you what is the #matter# said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in a harsh and constrained #tone#
oh come come but where is the #doctor# exclaimed $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ where is he #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ now deliberately descended the #staircase#
in #one# #hand# she held her handkerchief with which she appeared to be wiping her #face# and in the #other# a bottle of english smelling salts
her first #look# on entering the #room# was at $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ whose #face# independent of the #emotion# which such a #scene# could not fail of producing proclaimed him to be in #possession# of his usual health her second #glance# was at the dying #man#
she turned pale and her #eye# passed quickly from the #servant# and rested on the #master# in the #name# of heaven #madame# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ where is the #doctor#
he was with you just now you see this is a fit of apoplexy and he might be saved if he could but be bled
has he eaten #anything# lately asked #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ eluding her #husband# #question# #madame# replied $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ he has not even breakfasted
he has been running very fast on an errand with which my #grandfather# charged him and when he returned took #nothing# but a #glass# of lemonade
ah said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ why did he not take wine lemonade was a very bad #thing# for him
grandpapa bottle of lemonade was standing just by his #side# poor $barrois$ was very thirsty and was thankful to drink #anything# he could find
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ started $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looked at her with a #glance# of the most profound scrutiny he has such a short neck said she
#madame# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i ask where is $m_d_avrigny$ in god #name# #answer# me he is with $edward$ who is not quite well replied #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ no longer being able to avoid answering
they #will# no #doubt# bleed him therefore i #will# retire for i cannot endure the #sight# of #blood# and she followed her #husband# upstairs
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ rushed upstairs to fetch him take this said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ giving her smelling bottle to $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ now emerged from his hiding #place# where he had remained quite unperceived so great had been the general confusion
go away as quick as you can $m_maximilian_morrel$ said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and stay till i send for you go $m_maximilian_morrel$ looked towards $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ for permission to retire
the old #man# who had preserved all his usual coolness made a #sign# to him to do so the young #man# pressed $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #hand# to his #lip# and then left the $house_of_peers$ by a back #staircase#
at the same #moment# that he quitted the #room# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and the #doctor# entered by an opposite #door# $barrois$ was now showing #sign# of returning consciousness
the risis seemed past a low moaning was heard and he raised himself on #one# knee avrigny and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ laid him on a couch
what do you prescribe #doctor# demanded $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ give me some #water# and ether you have some in the $house_of_peers$ have you not
yes send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ immediately despatched a messenger and now let #everyone# retire
must i go too asked $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ timidly yes $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ you especially replied the #doctor# abruptly $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ looked at $m_d_avrigny$ with #astonishment# kissed her #grandfather# on the #forehead# and left the #room#
#look# look #doctor# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ he is quite coming round again i really do not think after all it is #anything# of consequence
the #doctor# closed the #door# after her with a gloomy #air# $m_d_avrigny$ answered by a melancholy #smile#
how do you feel $barrois$ asked he a little better #sir# #will# you drink some of this ether and #water#
because i feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of your #finger# the fit would #return#
i #will# try but dont touch me why not drink $barrois$ took the #glass# and raising it to his purple #lip# took about #half# of the liquid offered him
where do you suffer asked the #doctor# everywhere i feel cramps over my whole #body# do you find any dazzling sensation before the #eye#
yes any #noise# in the ears frightful when did you first feel that just now
suddenly yes like a clap of thunder did you feel #nothing# of it #yesterday# or the #day# before
#nothing# no drowsiness none what have you eaten #today# i have eaten #nothing# i only drank a #glass# of my #master# lemonade that all
and $barrois$ turned towards $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who immovably fixed in his armchair was contemplating this terrible #scene# without allowing a #word# or a movement to escape him
where is this lemonade asked the #doctor# eagerly downstairs in the decanter whereabouts downstairs
in the kitchen shall i go and fetch it #doctor# inquired $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ no stay here and try to make $barrois$ drink the #rest# of this #glass# of ether and #water#
$m_d_avrigny$ bounded towards the #door# flew down the back #staircase# and almost knocked down #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in his haste who was herself going down to the kitchen
she cried out but avrigny paid no #attention# to her possessed with but #one# #idea# he cleared the last four #step# with a bound and rushed into the kitchen where he saw the decanter about three #part# empty still standing on the waiter where it had been left
i #will# go myself and fetch the lemonade he darted upon it as an eagle would seize upon its prey panting with loss of breath he returned to the #room# he had just left
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was slowly ascending the #step# which led to her #room# is this the decanter you spoke of asked avrigny
yes #doctor# is this the same lemonade of which you partook i believe so what did it taste like
the #doctor# poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his #hand# put his #lip# to it and after having rinsed his mouth as a #man# does when he is tasting wine he spat the liquor into the fireplace
it had a bitter taste it is no #doubt# the same said he did you drink some too $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
yes and did you also discover a bitter taste yes oh #doctor# cried $barrois$
the fit is coming on again oh do #something# for me the #doctor# flew to his patient that emetic $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
see if it is coming $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ sprang into the passage exclaiming the emetic the emetic is it come yet
no #one# answered the most profound #terror# reigned throughout the $house_of_peers$ if i had #anything# by #mean# of which i could inflate the lungs said avrigny looking around him
perhaps i might prevent suffocation but there is #nothing# which would do #nothing# oh #sir# cried $barrois$ are you going to let me die without help
there was #one# lying on the #table# he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient who in the midst of his convulsions was making vain attempts to vomit but the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them
this second attack was much more violent than the first and he had slipped from the couch to the #ground# where he was writhing in agony
the #doctor# left him in this paroxysm knowing that he could do #nothing# to alleviate it and going up to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ said abruptly
oh i am dying oh save me a pen a pen said the #doctor# how do you find yourself well
yes have you any weight on the chest or does your stomach feel #light# and comfortable eh yes
then you feel pretty much as you generally do after you have had the dose which i am accustomed to give you every sunday
yes did $barrois$ make your lemonade yes was it you who asked him to drink some of it
no was it $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ no #madame# no it was your granddaughter then was it not
a groan from $barrois$ accompanied by a yawn which seemed to crack the very jawbones attracted the #attention# of $m_d_avrigny$ he left $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and returned to the sick #man#
yes $barrois$ said the #doctor# can you speak $barrois$ muttered a few unintelligible #word# try and make an #effort# to do so my good #man#
said avrigny $barrois$ reopened his bloodshot #eye# who made the lemonade i did did you bring it to your #master#
directly it was made no you left it somewhere then in the meantime yes i left it in the pantry because i was called away
who brought it into this #room# then $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ avrigny struck his #forehead# with his #hand#
gracious heaven exclaimed he #doctor# #doctor# cried $barrois$ who felt another fit coming #will# they never bring that emetic asked the #doctor#
here is a #glass# with #one# already prepared said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ entering the #room# who prepared it the chemist who came here with me
drink it said the #doctor# to $barrois$ impossible #doctor# it is too late my throat is closing up
i am choking oh my #heart# ah my #head# oh what agony shall i suffer like this long no no #friend# replied the #doctor#
my god have mercy upon me and uttering a fearful #cry# $barrois$ fell back as if he had been struck by lightning
you #will# soon cease to suffer ah i understand you said the unhappy #man# avrigny put his #hand# to his #heart# and placed a #glass# before his #lip#
well said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ went immediately
i am going to take my patient into the next #room# to bleed him this #sort# of attack is very frightful to witness
and taking $barrois$ under the #arm# he dragged him into an adjoining #room# but almost immediately he returned to fetch the lemonade
do not be alarmed $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ said avrigny $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ closed his #right# #eye# you want $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ do you not
i #will# tell them to send her to you $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ returned and avrigny met him in the passage well how is he now
asked he come in here said avrigny and he took him into the #chamber# where the sick #man# lay
is he still in a fit said the #procureur# he is dead $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ drew back a few #step# and clasping his #hand# exclaimed with real amazement and sympathy
dead and so soon too yes it is very soon said the #doctor# looking at the corpse before him
but that ought not to astonish you $monsieur_cavalcanti$ and $madame_de_saint_méran$ died as soon #people# die very suddenly in your $house_of_peers$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
what cried the #magistrate# with an accent of horror and consternation are you still harping on that terrible #idea#
still #sir# and i shall always do so replied avrigny for it has never for #one# #instant# ceased to retain #possession# of my #mind# and that you may be quite sure i am not mistaken this #time# listen well to what i am going to say $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
the #magistrate# trembled convulsively there is a #poison# which destroys #life# almost without leaving any perceptible traces
i recognized the #presence# of this #poison# in the #case# of poor $barrois$ as well as in that of $madame_de_saint_méran$
i know it well i have studied it in all its forms and in the #effect# which it produces there is a #way# of detecting its #presence#
it restores the blue color of litmus #paper# reddened by an acid and it #turn# syrup of violets green we have no litmus #paper# but see here they come with the syrup of violets
m avrigny opened the #door# and took from the #hand# of the chambermaid a cup which contained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup he then carefully closed the #door#
the #doctor# was #right# #step# were heard in the passage #look# said he to the #procureur# whose #heart# beat so loudly that it might almost be heard
here is in this cup some syrup of violets and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade of which $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and $barrois$ partook
if the lemonade be pure and inoffensive the syrup #will# retain its color if on the #contrary# the lemonade be drugged with #poison# the syrup #will# become green
the #doctor# then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the decanter into the cup and in an #instant# a #light# cloudy sediment began to form at the bottom of the cup this sediment first took a blue shade then from the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal and from opal to emerald
#look# closely arrived at this last hue it changed no more the result of the experiment left no #doubt# whatever on the #mind#
the unfortunate $barrois$ has been poisoned said avrigny and i #will# maintain this assertion before god and #man#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ said #nothing# but he clasped his #hand# opened his haggard #eye# and overcome with his #emotion# sank into a #chair#
the accusation $m_d_avrigny$ soon restored the #magistrate# to consciousness who had looked like a second corpse in that #chamber# of #death#
#chapter# oh #death# is in my $house_of_peers$ cried $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ say rather #crime# replied the #doctor# $m_d_avrigny$ cried $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
i cannot tell you all i feel at this #moment# #terror# #grief# madness yes said $m_d_avrigny$ with an imposing calmness
but i think it is now #time# to act i think it is #time# to stop this torrent of mortality
i can no longer bear to be in #possession# of these #secret# without the #hope# of seeing the victims and society generally revenged
come #magistrate# said $m_d_avrigny$ show yourself a #man# as an interpreter of the #law# do #honor# to your profession by sacrificing your selfish #interest# to it
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ cast a gloomy #look# around him in my $house_of_peers$ murmured he in my $house_of_peers$ you make me shudder #doctor#
do you talk of a sacrifice i do do you then suspect #anyone# i suspect no #one#
well i follow its #course# i track its passage i adopt the wisdom of the ancients and feel my #way# for my friendship for your #family# and my respect for you are as a twofold bandage over my #eye# well
#death# raps at your #door# it enters it goes not blindfolded but circumspectly from #room# to #room# oh speak speak
well #sir# you have in your establishment or in your #family# perhaps #one# of the frightful monstrosities of which each century produces only #one#
locusta and agrippina living at the same #time# were an exception and proved the determination of providence to #effect# the entire ruin of the roman empire sullied by so many #crime#
brunhilda and fredegund were the results of the painful struggle of civilization in its infancy when #man# was learning to control #mind# were it even by an emissary from the realms of #darkness#
the same flower of innocence had flourished or was still flourishing on their #brow# that is seen on the #brow# of the culprit in your $house_of_peers$
#doctor# i shall have courage all these #woman# had been or were beautiful $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ shrieked clasped his #hand# and looked at the #doctor# with a supplicating #air#
but the latter went on without #pity# seek whom the #crime# #will# profit says an axiom of jurisprudence
#doctor# cried $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ alas #doctor# how often has #man# #justice# been deceived by those fatal #word# i know not why but i feel that this #crime#
you acknowledge then the existence of the #crime# yes i see too plainly that it does exist but it seems that it is intended to affect me personally
the most selfish of all animals the most personal of all creatures who believes the #earth# #turn# the sun shines and #death# strikes for him alone an ant cursing god from the top of a blade of grass
i #fear# an attack myself after all these disasters oh #man# murmured avrigny and have those who have lost their #life# lost #nothing# de $madame_de_saint_méran$ $madame_de_saint_méran$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
how $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ yes think you it was the poor #servant# #life# was coveted no no like shakespeare polonius he died for another
it was $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the lemonade was intended for it is $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ logically speaking who drank it the #other# drank it only by accident and although $barrois$ is dead it was $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ whose #death# was wished for
i told you #one# #evening# in the #garden# after $madame_de_saint_méran$ #death# because his system is accustomed to that very #poison# and the dose was trifling to him which would be fatal to another because no #one# knows not even the assassin that for the last twelve #month# i have given $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ brucine for his paralytic affection while the assassin is not ignorant for he has proved that brucine is a violent #poison#
but why did it not kill my #father# oh have #pity# have #pity# murmured $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ wringing his #hand#
i would swear to it what i heard of his symptoms agrees too well with what i have seen in the #other# #case#
follow the culprit #step# he first kills de $madame_de_saint_méran$ oh #doctor# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ ceased to contend he only groaned
he first kills de $madame_de_saint_méran$ repeated the #doctor# then $madame_de_saint_méran$ a double #fortune# to inherit $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ wiped the perspiration from his #forehead#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ resumed $m_d_avrigny$ in the same pitiless #tone# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had once made a #will# against you against your #family# in favor of the poor in #fact# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ is spared because #nothing# is expected from him
but he has no sooner destroyed his first #will# and made a second than for #fear# he should make a third he is struck down
listen attentively alas stammered $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i do not lose a single #word# the #will# was made the #day# before #yesterday# i believe you see there has been no #time# lost
the physician has a sacred mission on #earth# and to fulfil it he begins at the source of #life# and goes down to the mysterious #darkness# of the tomb
when #crime# has been committed and god doubtless in anger #turn# away his #face# it is for the physician to bring the culprit to #justice#
oh mercy $m_d_avrigny$ no mercy #sir# have mercy on my #child# #sir# murmured $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
you see it is yourself who have first named her you her #father# have #pity# on $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ listen it is impossible
i would as willingly accuse myself $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ whose #heart# is pure as a #diamond# or a lily no #pity# #procureur# the #crime# is fragrant
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ herself packed all the medicines which were sent to de $madame_de_saint_méran$ and de $madame_de_saint_méran$ is dead $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ prepared all the cooling draughts which $madame_de_saint_méran$ took and $madame_de_saint_méran$ is dead
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ took from the #hand# of $barrois$ who was sent out the lemonade which $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had every #morning# and he has escaped by a miracle
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ is the culprit she is the poisoner to you as the #king# attorney i denounce $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ do your #duty#
#doctor# i resist no longer i can no longer defend myself i believe you but for #pity# sake spare my #life# my #honor#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ replied the #doctor# with increased vehemence there are occasions when i dispense with all foolish human circumspection
if your #daughter# had committed only #one# #crime# and i saw her meditating another i would say warn her punish her let her pass the remainder of her #life# in a convent weeping and praying
if she had committed two #crime# i would say here $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ is a #poison# that the #prisoner# is not acquainted with #one# that has no known antidote quick as #thought# rapid as lightning mortal as the thunderbolt give her that #poison# recommending her soul to god and save your #honor# and your #life# for it is yours she aims at and i can picture her approaching your pillow with her hypocritical #smile# and her sweet exhortations
this is what i would say had she only killed two #person# but she has seen three #death# has contemplated three murdered #person# has knelt by three corpses
woe to you $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ if you do not strike first to the scaffold with the poisoner to the scaffold
do you talk of your #honor# do what i tell you and immortality awaits you $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ fell on his knees
listen said he i have not the #strength# of #mind# you have or rather that which you would not have if instead of my #daughter# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
#doctor# every #son# of #woman# is born to suffer and to die i am content to suffer and to await #death#
your #daughter# madeleine were concerned the #doctor# turned pale beware said $m_d_avrigny$ it may come slowly you #will# see it approach after having struck your #father# your #wife# perhaps your #son#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ suffocating pressed the #doctor# #arm# listen cried he #pity# me help me no my #daughter# is not guilty
if you drag us both before a tribunal i #will# still say no my #daughter# is not guilty there is no #crime# in my $house_of_peers$
i #will# not acknowledge a #crime# in my $house_of_peers$ for when #crime# enters a dwelling it is like #death# it does not come alone
listen what does it signify to you if i am murdered are you my #friend# are you a #man# have you a #heart#
no you are a physician well i tell you i #will# not drag my #daughter# before a tribunal and give her up to the executioner
the bare #idea# would kill me would drive me like a madman to dig my #heart# out with my #finger# nails and if you were mistaken #doctor# if it were not my #daughter#
if i should come #one# #day# pale as a spectre and say to you assassin you have killed my #child# hold
if that should happen although i am a christian $m_d_avrigny$ i should kill myself well said the #doctor# after a #moment# #silence#
only continued $m_d_avrigny$ with a slow and solemn #tone# if #anyone# falls ill in your $house_of_peers$ if you feel yourself attacked do not send for me for i #will# come no more
i #will# consent to share this dreadful #secret# with you but i #will# not allow shame and remorse to grow and increase in my conscience as #crime# and misery #will# in your $house_of_peers$
i #will# wait $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looked at him as if he had doubted his #word# then you abandon me #doctor#
yes for i can follow you no farther and i only stop at the #foot# of the scaffold some further discovery #will# be made which #will# bring this dreadful tragedy to a close
adieu i entreat you #doctor# all the horrors that disturb my #thought# make your $house_of_peers$ odious and fatal
you go leaving me in all the horror of my situation after increasing it by what you have revealed to me
adieu #sir# #one# #word# #one# single #word# more #doctor# but what #will# be reported of the sudden #death# of the poor old #servant#
true said $m_d_avrigny$ we #will# #return# the #doctor# went out first followed by $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the terrified #servant# were on the stairs and in the passage where the #doctor# would pass
poor $barrois$ has led too sedentary a #life# of late accustomed formerly to ride on horseback or in the #carriage# to the four #corner# of europe the monotonous walk around that armchair has killed him
#sir# said avrigny to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ so loud that all might hear his #blood# has thickened he was stout had a short thick neck he was attacked with apoplexy and i was called in too late
by the #way# added he in a low #tone# take #care# to throw away that cup of syrup of violets in the ashes
the #doctor# without shaking #hand# with $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ without adding a #word# to what he had said went out amid the #tear# and lamentations of the whole household
the same #evening# all $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #servant# who had assembled in the kitchen and had a long consultation came to tell #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ that they wished to leave
no entreaty no proposition of increased wages could induce them to remain to every argument they replied we must go for #death# is in this $house_of_peers$
they all left in #spite# of prayers and entreaties testifying their regret at leaving so good a #master# and mistress and especially $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ so good so kind and so gentle
she was in #tear# and strange as it was in #spite# of the #emotion# he felt at the #sight# of these #tear# he looked also at #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy #smile# had passed over her thin #lip# like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously between two clouds in a stormy sky
the #evening# of the #day# on which the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had left $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $house_of_peers$ with #feeling# of shame and anger at the rejection of the projected alliance $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ with curled #hair# moustaches in perfect #order# and white gloves which fitted admirably had entered the courtyard of the #banker# $house_of_peers$ in rue de la chaussée antin
he had not been more than ten #minute# in the #drawing# #room# before he drew $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ aside into the recess of a bow #window# and after an ingenious preamble related to him all his anxieties and #care# since his noble #father# departure
he acknowledged the extreme kindness which had been shown him by the #banker# #family# in which he had been received as a #son# and where besides his warmest affections had found an object on which to centre in $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ listened with the most profound #attention# he had expected this declaration for the last two or three #day# and when at last it came his #eye# glistened as much as they had lowered on listening to $m_albert_de_morcerf$
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looked at $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ as they said this #chapter# the #room# of the retired baker he would not however yield immediately to the young #man#
request but made a few conscientious objections are you not rather young $andrea_rondolo$ to think of marrying
i think not #sir# replied $monsieur_cavalcanti$ in italy the nobility generally marry young #life# is so uncertain that we ought to secure #happiness# while it is within our reach
well #sir# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ in #case# your proposals which do me #honor# are accepted by my #wife# and #daughter# by whom shall the preliminary arrangements be settled
so important a negotiation should i think be conducted by the respective #father# of the young #people# #sir# my #father# is a #man# of great foresight and prudence
thinking that i might #wish# to settle in france he left me at his departure together with the #paper# establishing my identity a #letter# promising if he approved of my choice livres per annum from the #day# i was married
so far as i can judge i suppose this to be a #quarter# of my #father# revenue i said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ have always intended giving my #daughter# #franc# as her dowry she is besides my sole heiress
all would then be easily arranged if the #baroness# and her #daughter# are willing we should command an annuity of livres
supposing also i should persuade the marquis to give me my capital which is not likely but still is possible we would #place# these two or three #million# in your #hand# whose talent might make it realize ten per cent
i never give more than four per cent and generally only three and a #half# but to my #son# in #law# i would give five and we would share the profits
very good #father# in #law# said $monsieur_cavalcanti$ yielding to his low born #nature# which would escape sometimes through the aristocratic gloss with which he sought to conceal it
correcting himself immediately he said excuse me #sir# #hope# alone makes me almost mad what #will# not reality do
but said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who on his #part# did not perceive how soon the #conversation# which was at first disinterested was turning to a #business# transaction there is doubtless a #part# of your #fortune# your #father# could not refuse you
which asked the young #man# that you inherit from your #mother# truly from my #mother# leonora corsinari
i assure you i have never given the #subject# a #thought# but i suppose it must have been at least two #million#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ felt as much overcome with #joy# as the miser who finds a lost #treasure# or as the shipwrecked mariner who feels himself on solid #ground# instead of in the abyss which he expected would swallow him up
how much may it amount to indeed #sir# said $andrea_rondolo$ well #sir# said $andrea_rondolo$ bowing to the #banker# respectfully
may i #hope# you may not only #hope# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ but consider it a settled #thing# if no obstacle arises on your #part#
but said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ thoughtfully how is it that your patron de $m_de_monte_cristo$ did not make his proposal for you
i am indeed rejoiced said $andrea_rondolo$ andrea blushed imperceptibly i have just left the #count# #sir# said he
he even told me he had not the slightest #doubt# that my #father# would give me the capital instead of the #interest# of my property
he has promised to #use# his influence to obtain it for me but he also declared that he never had taken on himself the responsibility of making proposals for another and he never would
i must however do him the #justice# to add that he assured me if ever he had regretted the repugnance he felt to such a #step# it was on this occasion because he #thought# the projected union would be a happy and suitable #one#
he is doubtless a delightful #man# but inconceivably peculiar in his #idea# he esteems me highly besides if he #will# do #nothing# officially he #will# #answer# any #question# you propose to him
and now continued he with #one# of his most charming #smile# having finished talking to the #father# in #law# i must address myself to the #banker#
that the #day# after #tomorrow# i shall have to draw upon you for about four thousand #franc# but the #count# expecting my bachelor revenue could not suffice for the coming #month# outlay has offered me a draft for twenty thousand #franc#
and what may you have to say to him said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ laughing in his #turn# it bears his signature as you see which is all sufficient
bring me a #million# such as that said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i shall be well pleased putting the draft in his #pocket#
fix your own #hour# for #tomorrow# and my cashier shall call on you with a check for eighty thousand #franc#
at ten clock then if you please i should like it early as i am going into the #country# #tomorrow#
the following #morning# with the #banker# usual punctuality the eighty thousand #franc# were placed in the young #man# #hand# as he was on the #point# of starting after having left two hundred #franc# for $m_caderousse$
very well at ten clock you are still at the hôtel des princes yes he went out chiefly to avoid this dangerous #enemy# and returned as late as possible in the #evening#
but scarcely had he stepped out of his #carriage# when the porter met him with a parcel in his #hand#
#sir# said he that #man# has been here what #man# said $andrea_rondolo$ carelessly apparently forgetting him whom he but too well recollected
him to whom your #excellency# pays that little annuity oh said $andrea_rondolo$ my #father# old #servant# well you gave him the two hundred #franc# i had left for him
yes your #excellency# $andrea_rondolo$ had expressed a #wish# to be thus addressed but continued the porter he would not take them
$andrea_rondolo$ turned pale but as it was dark his pallor was not perceptible what he would not take them said he with slight #emotion#
no he wished to speak to your #excellency# i told him you were gone out and after some dispute he believed me and gave me this #letter# which he had brought with him already sealed
give it me said $andrea_rondolo$ and he read by the #light# of his #carriage# lamp you know where i live i expect you #tomorrow# #morning# at nine clock
$andrea_rondolo$ examined it carefully to ascertain if the #letter# had been opened or if any indiscreet #eye# had seen its contents but it was so carefully folded that no #one# could have read it and the seal was perfect
very well said he poor #man# he is a worthy creature he left the porter to ponder on these #word# not knowing which most to admire the #master# or the #servant#
take out the #horse# quickly and come up to me said $andrea_rondolo$ to his groom in two seconds the young #man# had reached his #room# and burnt $m_caderousse$ #letter#
the #servant# entered just as he had finished you are about my height pierre said he i have that #honor# your #excellency#
i have an engagement with a pretty little #girl# for this #evening# and do not #wish# to be known lend me your livery till #tomorrow#
you had a new livery #yesterday# yes #sir# i may sleep perhaps at an inn
five #minute# after $andrea_rondolo$ left the hotel completely disguised took a cabriolet and ordered the driver to take him to the cheval rouge at picpus
the next #morning# he left that inn as he had left the hôtel des princes without being noticed walked down the faubourg saint antoine along the boulevard to rue ménilmontant and stopping at the #door# of the third $house_of_peers$ on the left looked for someone of whom to make inquiry in the porter absence
pierre obeyed for whom are you looking my fine #fellow# asked the fruiteress on the opposite #side# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ pailletin if you please my good #woman# replied $andrea_rondolo$
a retired baker asked the fruiteress exactly he #life# at the #end# of the yard on the left on the third #story#
$andrea_rondolo$ went as she directed him and on the third #floor# he found a hare paw which by the hasty ringing of the bell it was evident he pulled with considerable ill temper
a #moment# after $m_caderousse$ #face# appeared at the grating in the #door# ah you are punctual said he as he drew back the #door#
said $andrea_rondolo$ throwing himself into a #chair# in a #manner# which implied that he would rather have flung it at the #head# of his host
confound you and your punctuality come come my little #fellow# dont be angry see i have #thought# about you
$andrea_rondolo$ indeed inhaled the scent of #something# cooking which was not unwelcome to him hungry as he was it was that mixture of fat and garlic peculiar to provençal kitchens of an inferior #order# added to that of dried fish and above all the pungent smell of musk and cloves
these odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered and placed on a stove and from a copper pan placed in an old #iron# pot
in an adjoining #room# $andrea_rondolo$ saw also a tolerably clean #table# prepared for two two bottles of wine sealed the #one# with green the #other# with yellow a supply of brandy in a decanter and a measure of fruit in a cabbage leaf cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate
#look# at the good breakfast we are going to have #nothing# but what you are fond of what do you think of it my little #fellow# said $m_caderousse$
ay that smells good you know i used to be a good cook do you recollect how you used to lick your #finger#
you were among the first who tasted any of my dishes and i think you relished them tolerably while speaking $m_caderousse$ went on peeling a fresh supply of onions
but said $andrea_rondolo$ ill temperedly by my faith if it was only to breakfast with you that you disturbed me i #wish# the devil had taken you
my #boy# said $m_caderousse$ sententiously #one# can talk while eating and then you ungrateful being you are not pleased to see an old #friend#
he was truly crying but it would have been difficult to say whether #joy# or the onions produced the greatest #effect# on the lachrymal glands of the old innkeeper of the pont du gard
i am weeping with #joy# hold your tongue hypocrite said $andrea_rondolo$ you #love# me yes i do or may the devil take me
i know it is a weakness said $m_caderousse$ but it overpowers me and yet it has not prevented your sending for me to play me some trick
come said $m_caderousse$ wiping his large knife on his apron if i did not like you do you think i should endure the wretched #life# you lead me
think for a #moment# you have your #servant# clothes on you therefore keep a #servant# i have none and am obliged to prepare my own meals
you abuse my cookery because you dine at the #table# hôte of the hôtel des princes or the café de paris
well i too could keep a #servant# i too could have a tilbury i too could dine where i like but why do i not
because i would not annoy my little $m_benedetto$ come just acknowledge that i could eh this address was accompanied by a #look# which was by no #mean# difficult to understand
well said $andrea_rondolo$ admitting your #love# why do you want me to breakfast with you that i may have the #pleasure# of seeing you my little #fellow#
what is the #use# of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements eh dear #friend# said $m_caderousse$ are #will# ever made without codicils
well sit down and let us begin with these pilchards and this fresh butter which i have put on some vine leaves to please you wicked #one#
but you first came to breakfast did you not ah yes you #look# at my #room# my four straw #chair# my images three #franc# each
but what do you expect this is not the hôtel des princes come you are growing discontented you are no longer happy you who only #wish# to live like a retired baker
$m_caderousse$ sighed well what have you to say you have seen your #dream# realized i can still say it is a #dream# a retired baker my poor $m_benedetto$ is rich
he has an annuity well you have an annuity i have yes since i bring you your two hundred #franc#
$m_caderousse$ shrugged his #shoulder# it is humiliating said he thus to receive #money# given grudgingly an uncertain supply which may soon fail
you see i am obliged to economize in #case# your prosperity should cease well my #friend# #fortune# is inconstant as the chaplain of the regiment said
i know your prosperity is great you rascal you are to marry the #daughter# of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ what of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
he was an old #friend# of mine and if he had not so bad a memory he ought to invite me to your wedding seeing he came to mine
yes to be sure must i say #baron# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i might as well say #count# $m_benedetto$ yes yes to mine gad he was not so proud
then he was an under clerk to the good $m_maximilian_morrel$ i have dined many #time# with him and the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$
so you see i have some high connections and were i to cultivate them a little we might meet in the same #drawing# #room#
come your jealousy represents #everything# to you in the wrong #light# that is all very fine $m_benedetto$ mio but i know what i am saying
perhaps i may #one# #day# put on my best coat and presenting myself at the great #gate# introduce myself meanwhile let us sit down and eat
the latter seemed to have resigned himself he drew the corks and partook largely of the fish with the garlic and fat
$m_caderousse$ set the example and attacked the breakfast with good appetite praising each dish he set before his visitor
ah mate said $m_caderousse$ you are getting on better terms with your old landlord faith yes replied $andrea_rondolo$ whose hunger prevailed over every #other# #feeling#
so you like it you rogue so much that i wonder how a #man# who can cook thus can complain of hard living
do you see said $m_caderousse$ all my #happiness# is marred by #one# #thought# what is that that i am dependent on another i who have always gained my own livelihood honestly
do not let that disturb you i have enough for two no truly you may believe me if you #will# at the #end# of every #month# i am tormented by remorse
good $m_caderousse$ so much so that #yesterday# i would not take the two hundred #franc# yes you wished to speak to me but was it indeed remorse tell me
true remorse and besides an #idea# had struck me $andrea_rondolo$ shuddered he always did so at $m_caderousse$ #idea# it is miserable
do you see always to wait till the #end# of the #month# oh said $andrea_rondolo$ philosophically determined to watch his #companion# narrowly does not #life# pass in waiting
yes because instead of expecting two hundred wretched #franc# you expect five or six thousand perhaps ten perhaps even twelve for you take #care# not to let #anyone# know the utmost
do i for instance fare better well i wait patiently do i not down there you always had little presents and christmas #box# which you tried to hide from your poor #friend# $m_caderousse$
fortunately he is a cunning #fellow# that #friend# $m_caderousse$ there you are beginning again to ramble to talk again and again of the past
but what is the #use# of teasing me with going all over that again ah you are only #one# and twenty and can forget the past i am fifty and am obliged to recollect it
but let us #return# to #business# yes i was going to say if i were in your #place#
i would ask for six #month# in advance under pretence of being able to purchase a farm then with my six #month# i would decamp
well i would realize how would you realize well well said $andrea_rondolo$ that isnt a bad #idea#
my dear #friend# said $m_caderousse$ eat of my bread and take my advice you #will# be none the worse off physically or morally
but said $andrea_rondolo$ why do you not act on the advice you gave me why do you not realize a six #month# a #year# advance even and retire to brussels
instead of living the retired baker you might live as a bankrupt using his privileges that would be very good
but how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred #franc# ah $m_caderousse$ said $andrea_rondolo$ how covetous you are
the appetite grows by what it feeds on said $m_caderousse$ grinning and showing his teeth like a monkey laughing or a tiger growling
two #month# ago you were dying with hunger and added he biting off with his large white teeth an enormous mouthful of bread
i have formed a #plan# $m_caderousse$ #plan# alarmed $andrea_rondolo$ still more than his #idea# #idea# were but the germ the #plan# was reality
let me see your #plan# i dare say it is a pretty #one# why not who formed the #plan# by which we left the establishment of
eh was it not i and it was no bad #one# i believe since here we are i do not say replied $andrea_rondolo$ that you never make a good #one# but let us see your #plan#
well pursued $m_caderousse$ can you without expending #one# sou put me in the #way# of getting fifteen thousand #franc#
no fifteen thousand are not enough i cannot again become an honest #man# with less than thirty thousand #franc# no replied $andrea_rondolo$ dryly
no i cannot i do not think you understand me replied $m_caderousse$ calmly i said without your laying out a sou
do you want me to commit a robbery to spoil all my good #fortune# and yours with mine and both of us to be dragged down there again
it would make very little difference to me said $m_caderousse$ if i were retaken i am a poor creature to live alone and sometimes pine for my old comrades not like you heartless creature who would be glad never to see them again
$andrea_rondolo$ did more than tremble this #time# he turned pale come $m_caderousse$ no nonsense said he
dont alarm yourself my little $m_benedetto$ but just #point# out to me some #mean# of gaining those thirty thousand #franc# without your assistance and i #will# contrive it
well i ll see i ll try to contrive some #way# said $andrea_rondolo$ meanwhile you #will# raise my monthly allowance to five hundred #franc# my little #fellow#
i have a fancy and #mean# to get a housekeeper well you shall have your five hundred #franc# said $andrea_rondolo$
but it is very hard for me my poor $m_caderousse$ you take advantage bah said $m_caderousse$ when you have access to countless stores
#one# would have said $andrea_rondolo$ anticipated his #companion# #word# so did his #eye# flash like lightning but it was but for a #moment#
true he replied and my protector is very kind that dear protector said $m_caderousse$ and how much does he give you monthly
five thousand #franc# as many thousands as you give me hundreds truly it is only bastards who are thus fortunate
five thousand #franc# per #month# what the devil can you do with all that oh it is no trouble to spend that and i am like you i want capital
capital yes i understand #everyone# would like capital well and i shall get it who #will# give it to you
your prince yes my prince but unfortunately i must wait you must wait for what asked $m_caderousse$
for his #death# the #death# of your prince yes how so because he has made his #will# in my favor
indeed on my #honor# for how much for five hundred thousand only that it little enough
but so it is no it cannot be are you my #friend# $m_caderousse$ yes in #life# or #death#
well i #will# tell you a #secret# what is it but remember ah $pardieu$ mute as a carp
well i think $andrea_rondolo$ stopped and looked around you think do not #fear# $pardieu$ we are alone
i think i have discovered my #father# your true #father# yes not old $monsieur_cavalcanti$
no for he has gone again the true #one# as you say and that #father# is
he cannot acknowledge me openly it appears but he does it through $monsieur_cavalcanti$ and gives him fifty thousand #franc# for it
well $m_caderousse$ it is $m_de_monte_cristo$ bah yes you understand that explains all fifty thousand #franc# for being your #father#
i would have done it for #half# that for twenty thousand for fifteen thousand why did you not think of me ungrateful #man#
did i know #anything# about it when it was all done when i was down there ah truly
and you say that by his #will# he leaves me five hundred thousand livres are you sure of it
he showed it me but that is not all there is a codicil as i said just now probably
oh the good #father# the brave #father# the very honest #father# said $m_caderousse$ twirling a plate in the #air# between his two #hand#
and in that codicil he acknowledges me now say if i conceal #anything# from you
no and your confidence makes you honorable in my #opinion# and your princely #father# is he rich very rich yes he is that he does not himself know the amount of his #fortune#
the #other# #day# a #banker# clerk brought him fifty thousand #franc# in a portfolio about the size of your plate #yesterday# his #banker# brought him a hundred thousand #franc# in #gold#
$m_caderousse$ was filled with wonder the young #man# #word# sounded to him like metal and he #thought# he could hear the rushing of cascades of $louis_xviii$
is it possible it is evident enough to me who am always at his $house_of_peers$ and you go into that $house_of_peers$
cried he briskly when i like $m_caderousse$ was thoughtful for a #moment# it was easy to perceive he was revolving some unfortunate #idea# in his #mind#
then suddenly how i should like to see all that cried he how beautiful it must be it is in #fact# magnificent said $andrea_rondolo$
and does he not live in the champs élysées yes no ah said $m_caderousse$ no
yes a fine $house_of_peers$ standing alone between a courtyard and a #garden# you must know it possibly but it is not the exterior i #care# for it is the interior
what beautiful furniture there must be in it have you ever seen the tuileries no well it surpasses that
it must be worth #one# while to stoop $andrea_rondolo$ when that good $m_de_monte_cristo$ lets fall his purse
it is not worthwhile to wait for that said $andrea_rondolo$ #money# is as plentiful in that $house_of_peers$ as fruit in an orchard
but you should take me there #one# #day# with you how can i on what plea
you are #right# but you have made my mouth #water# i must absolutely see it i shall find a #way#
no nonsense $m_caderousse$ i #will# offer myself as #floor# polisher the #room# are all carpeted
well then i must be contented to imagine it that is the best #plan# believe me
try at least to give me an #idea# of what it is how can i #nothing# is easier
is it large middling how is it arranged faith i should require pen ink and #paper# to make a #plan#
they are all here said $m_caderousse$ briskly he fetched from an old secretaire a sheet of white #paper# and pen and ink
here said $m_caderousse$ draw me all that on the #paper# my #boy# $andrea_rondolo$ took the pen with an imperceptible #smile# and began
the $house_of_peers$ as i said is between the #court# and the #garden# in this #way# do you see $andrea_rondolo$ drew the #garden# the #court# and the $house_of_peers$
high #wall# not more than eight or ten #foot# that is not prudent said $m_caderousse$
in the #court# are orange #tree# in pots turf and clumps of flowers and no steel traps no
the stables are on either #side# of the #gate# which you see there and $andrea_rondolo$ continued his #plan# let us see the #ground# #floor# said $m_caderousse$
on the #ground# #floor# dining #room# two #drawing# #room# billiard #room# #staircase# in the hall and a little back #staircase# #window# magnificent #window# so beautiful so large
that i believe a #man# of your size should pass through each frame why the devil have they any stairs with such #window#
luxury has #everything# but shutters yes but they are never used that #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ is an original who loves to #look# at the sky even at #night#
and where do the #servant# sleep oh they have a $house_of_peers$ to themselves picture to yourself a pretty coach $house_of_peers$ at the #right# #hand# #side# where the ladders are kept
well over that coach $house_of_peers$ are the #servant# #room# with bells corresponding with the different #apartment# ah diable bells did you say
i only say they cost a load of #money# to hang and what is the #use# of them i should like to know
there used to be a dog let loose in the yard at #night# but it has been taken to the $house_of_peers$ at $auteuil$ to that you went to you know
what do you #mean# oh #nothing# yes i was saying to him only #yesterday#
you are imprudent $monsieur_cavalcanti$ #count# for when you go to $auteuil$ and take your #servant# the $house_of_peers$ is left unprotected
well said he what next well next some #day# you #will# be robbed what did he #answer#
he quietly said what do i #care# if i am $andrea_rondolo$ he has some secretaire with a spring
how do you know yes which catches the thief in a trap and plays a tune i was told there were such at the last exhibition
he has simply a mahogany secretaire in which the key is always kept and he is not robbed
no his #servant# are all devoted to him there ought to be some #money# in that secretaire
there may be no #one# knows what there is and where is it on the first #floor#
sketch me the #plan# of that #floor# as you have done of the #ground# #floor# my #boy# that is very simple
on the first #story# do you see there is the anteroom and the #drawing# #room# to the #right# of the #drawing# #room# a library and a #study# to the left a bedroom and a dressing #room#
$andrea_rondolo$ took the pen the famous secretaire is in the dressing #room# is there a #window# in the dressing #room#
$andrea_rondolo$ sketched two #window# in the #room# which formed an angle on the #plan# and appeared as a small square added to the rectangle of the bedroom
two #one# here and #one# there $m_caderousse$ became thoughtful does he often go to $auteuil$ added he two or three #time# a week
#tomorrow# for instance he is going to spend the #day# and #night# there are you sure of it he has invited me to dine there
there a #life# for you said $m_caderousse$ a town $house_of_peers$ and a #country# $house_of_peers$ that is what it is to be rich
and shall you dine there probably when you dine there do you sleep there
if i like i am at home there $m_caderousse$ looked at the young #man# as if to get at the #truth# from the bottom of his #heart#
but $andrea_rondolo$ drew a cigar #case# from his #pocket# took a havana quietly lit it and began smoking when do you want your twelve hundred #franc# said he to $m_caderousse$
now if you have them $andrea_rondolo$ took five and twenty $louis_xviii$ from his #pocket# yellow #boy# said $m_caderousse$
no i #thank# you oh you despise them on the #contrary# i esteem them but #will# not have them
exactly and he who changes them #will# follow #friend# $m_caderousse$ lay #hand# on him and demand what farmers pay him their rent in #gold#
you can change them idiot #gold# is worth five sous no nonsense my good #fellow# silver simply round coins with the #head# of some monarch or #other# on them
anybody may possess a five #franc# #piece# but do you suppose i carry five hundred #franc# about with me i should want a porter
well leave them with your porter he is to be trusted i #will# call for them #today# no #tomorrow#
i shall not have #time# #today# well #tomorrow# i #will# leave them when i go to $auteuil$
may i depend on it certainly because i shall secure my housekeeper on the #strength# of it
now see here #will# that be all eh and #will# you not torment me any more never
$m_caderousse$ had become so gloomy that $andrea_rondolo$ feared he should be obliged to notice the change he redoubled his gayety and carelessness
how sprightly you are said $m_caderousse$ #one# would say you were already in #possession# of your property
no unfortunately but when i do obtain it well i shall remember old #friend# i can tell you that
yes since you have such a good memory what do you want it #look# as if you were trying to fleece me
i what an #idea# i who am going to give you another #piece# of good advice what is it
to leave behind you the #diamond# you have on your #finger# we shall both get into trouble you #will# ruin both yourself and me by your folly
you put on a livery you disguise yourself as a #servant# and yet keep a #diamond# on your #finger# worth four or five thousand #franc#
how so said $andrea_rondolo$ how you guess well i know #something# of #diamond# i have had some
you do well to boast of it said $andrea_rondolo$ who without becoming angry as $m_caderousse$ feared at this new extortion quietly resigned the ring
$m_caderousse$ looked so closely at it that $andrea_rondolo$ well knew that he was examining to see if all the edges were perfect
it is a false #diamond# said $m_caderousse$ you are joking now replied $andrea_rondolo$ do not be angry we can try it
$m_caderousse$ went to the #window# touched the #glass# with it and found it would cut confiteor said $m_caderousse$ putting the #diamond# on his little #finger#
i was mistaken but those thieves of jewellers imitate so well that it is no longer worthwhile to rob a jeweller shop
it is another branch of industry paralyzed have you finished said $andrea_rondolo$ do you want #anything# more #will# you have my waistcoat or my hat
no you are after all a good #companion# i #will# not detain you and #will# try to cure myself of my ambition
make free now you have begun but take #care# the same #thing# does not happen to you in selling the #diamond# you feared with the #gold#
i shall not sell it do not #fear# not at least till the #day# after #tomorrow# #thought# the young #man#
happy rogue said $m_caderousse$ you are going to find your #servant# your #horse# your #carriage# and your betrothed
yes said $andrea_rondolo$ well i #hope# you #will# make a handsome wedding present the #day# you marry $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
i have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your #head# what #fortune# has she
but i tell you a #million# $andrea_rondolo$ shrugged his #shoulder# let it be a #million# said $m_caderousse$
you can never have so much as i #wish# you #thank# you said the young #man# oh i #wish# it you with all my #heart# added $m_caderousse$ with his hoarse laugh
stop let me show you the #way# it is not worthwhile yes it is
because there is a little #secret# a precaution i #thought# it desirable to take #one# of huret fichet locks revised and improved by $gaspard_caderousse$ $m_caderousse$ i #will# manufacture you a similar #one# when you are a capitalist
$m_caderousse$ remained on the landing until he had not only seen $andrea_rondolo$ go down the three #story# but also cross the #court#
then he returned hastily shut his #door# carefully and began to #study# like a clever architect the #plan# $andrea_rondolo$ had left him
why #thank# you said $andrea_rondolo$ i #will# let you know a week beforehand they parted dear $m_benedetto$ said he
i think he #will# not be sorry to inherit his #fortune# and he who hastens the #day# when he can touch his five hundred thousand #will# not be his worst #friend#
the #day# following that on which the #conversation# we have related took #place# the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ set out for $auteuil$ accompanied by $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and several attendants and also taking with him some #horse# whose qualities he was desirous of ascertaining
he was induced to undertake this journey of which the #day# before he had not even #thought# and which had not occurred to $andrea_rondolo$ either by the arrival of $m_bertuccio$ from normandy with intelligence respecting the $house_of_peers$ and sloop
the $house_of_peers$ was ready and the sloop which had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a small creek with her crew of six #man# who had observed all the requisite formalities and were ready again to put to #sea#
the #count# praised $m_bertuccio$ zeal and ordered him to prepare for a speedy departure as his stay in france would not be prolonged more than a #month#
i may require to go in #one# #night# from paris to tréport let eight fresh #horse# be in readiness on the #road# which #will# enable me to go fifty leagues in ten #hour#
#chapter# the burglary now said he your highness had already expressed that #wish# said $m_bertuccio$ and the #horse# are ready
i have bought them and stationed them myself at the most desirable posts that is in villages where no #one# generally stops
as $m_bertuccio$ was leaving the #room# to give the requisite #order# $monsieur_baptistin$ opened the #door# he held a #letter# on a silver waiter
that well said $m_de_monte_cristo$ i remain here a #day# or two arrange accordingly what are you doing here asked the #count# seeing him covered with dust
i did not send for you i think $monsieur_baptistin$ without answering approached the #count# and presented the #letter# important and urgent said he
$m_de_monte_cristo$ is apprised that this #night# a #man# #will# enter his $house_of_peers$ in the champs élysées with the intention of carrying off some #paper# supposed to be in the secretaire in the dressing #room#
the #count# well known courage #will# render unnecessary the aid of the #police# whose interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice
the #count# by any #opening# from the bedroom or by concealing himself in the dressing #room# would be able to defend his property himself
many attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from the attempt and de $m_de_monte_cristo$ would lose the opportunity of discovering an #enemy# whom #chance# has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the #count# a warning he might not be able to send another #time# if this first attempt should fail and another be made
the #count# first #idea# was that this was an artifice a gross deception to draw his #attention# from a minor danger in #order# to expose him to a greater
he was on the #point# of sending the #letter# to the commissary of #police# notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous #friend# or perhaps because of that advice when suddenly the #idea# occurred to him that it might be some personal #enemy# whom he alone should recognize and over whom if such were the #case# he alone would gain any advantage as fiesco had done over the moor who would have killed him
we know the #count# vigorous and daring #mind# denying #anything# to be impossible with that energy which marks the great #man#
from his past #life# from his resolution to shrink from #nothing# the #count# had acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged sometimes against #nature# that is to say against god and sometimes against the #world# that is against the devil
the #count# opened the #letter# and read they do not want my #paper# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ they want to kill me
they are no robbers but assassins i #will# not allow the prefect of #police# to interfere with my private #affair#
i am rich enough forsooth to distribute his authority on this occasion the #count# recalled $monsieur_baptistin$ who had left the #room# after delivering the #letter#
#return# to paris said he assemble the #servant# who remain there i want all my household at $auteuil$
but #will# no #one# remain in the $house_of_peers$ my lord asked $monsieur_baptistin$ yes the porter my lord #will# remember that the lodge is at a #distance# from the $house_of_peers$
well the $house_of_peers$ might be stripped without his hearing the least #noise# by whom by thieves
you are a fool $monsieur_baptistin$ thieves might strip the $house_of_peers$ it would annoy me less than to be disobeyed
bring your comrades here #one# and all but let #everything# remain as usual only close the shutters of the #ground# #floor#
$monsieur_baptistin$ bowed you understand me said the #count# and those of the first #floor#
you know they are never closed go the #count# signified his intention of dining alone and that no #one#
having dined with his usual tranquillity and moderation the #count# making a signal to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ to follow him went out by the #side# #gate# and on reaching the bois de boulogne turned apparently without design towards paris and at twilight found himself opposite his $house_of_peers$ in the champs élysées
all was dark #one# solitary feeble #light# was burning in the porter lodge about forty paces distant from the $house_of_peers$ as $monsieur_baptistin$ had said
$m_de_monte_cristo$ leaned against a #tree# and with that scrutinizing #glance# which was so rarely deceived looked up and down the avenue examined the passers by and carefully looked down the neighboring #street# to see that no #one# was concealed
he hastened to the #side# #door# with $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ entered hurriedly and by the #servant# #staircase# of which he had the key gained his bedroom without #opening# or disarranging a single curtain without even the porter having the slightest suspicion that the $house_of_peers$ which he supposed empty contained its chief occupant
but $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ should attend him ten #minute# passed thus and he was convinced that no #one# was watching him arrived in his bedroom the #count# motioned to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ to stop then he passed into the dressing #room# which he examined
he double locked it took the key returned to the bedroom #door# removed the double staple of the bolt and went in
meanwhile $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ had procured the #arm# the #count# required namely a short carbine and a pair of double barrelled #pistol# with which as sure an aim might be taken as with a single barrelled #one#
#everything# appeared as usual the precious secretaire in its #place# and the key in the secretaire thus armed the #count# held the #life# of five #man# in his #hand#
the #count# and $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a #glass# of spanish wine then $m_de_monte_cristo$ slipped aside #one# of the movable panels which enabled him to see into the adjoining #room#
he had within his reach his #pistol# and carbine and $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ standing near him held #one# of the small arabian hatchets whose form has not varied since the crusades
through #one# of the #window# of the bedroom on a #line# with that in the dressing #room# the #count# could see into the #street#
it was intensely dark still $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ #thank# to his wild #nature# and the #count# #thank# doubtless to his long confinement could distinguish in the #darkness# the slightest movement of the #tree#
it might be expected that the attack if indeed an attack was projected would be made from the #staircase# of the #ground# #floor# and not from a #window# in $m_de_monte_cristo$ #opinion# the villains sought his #life# not his #money#
it would be his bedroom they would attack and they must reach it by the back #staircase# or by the #window# in the dressing #room#
the clock of the invalides struck a #quarter# to twelve the west wind bore on its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes
as the last stroke died away the #count# #thought# he heard a slight #noise# in the dressing #room# this first #sound# or rather this first grinding was followed by a second then a third at the fourth the #count# knew what to expect
it was about #half# past nine two #hour# passed thus the little #light# in the lodge had long been extinct a firm and well practised #hand# was engaged in cutting the four #side# of a pane of #glass# with a #diamond#
inured as #man# may be to danger forewarned as they may be of peril they understand by the fluttering of the #heart# and the shuddering of the frame the enormous difference between a #dream# and a reality between the project and the execution
however $m_de_monte_cristo$ only made a #sign# to apprise $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ who understanding that danger was approaching from the #other# #side# drew nearer to his #master#
the #count# felt his #heart# beat more rapidly $m_de_monte_cristo$ was eager to ascertain the #strength# and number of his #enemy#
the #window# whence the #noise# proceeded was opposite the #opening# by which the #count# could see into the dressing #room# he fixed his #eye# on that #window#
he distinguished a #shadow# in the #darkness# then #one# of the panes became quite opaque as if a sheet of #paper# were stuck on the outside then the square cracked without falling
through the #opening# an #arm# was passed to find the fastening then a second the #window# turned on its hinges and a #man# entered
he was alone that a daring rascal whispered the #count# at that #moment# $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ touched him slightly on the #shoulder#
he turned $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ pointed to the #window# of the #room# in which they were facing the #street# i see said he there are two of them #one# does the #work# while the #other# stands guard
he made a #sign# to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ not to lose #sight# of the #man# in the #street# and turned to the #one# in the dressing #room#
the #glass# cutter had entered and was #feeling# his #way# his #arm# stretched out before him at last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his surroundings
when he drew near to the bedroom #door# $m_de_monte_cristo$ expected that he was coming in and raised #one# of his #pistol# but he simply heard the #sound# of the bolts sliding in their copper rings
the nocturnal visitor ignorant of the #fact# that the #count# had removed the staples might now think himself at home and pursue his #purpose# with full security
alone and free to act as he wished the #man# then drew from his #pocket# #something# which the #count# could not discern placed it on a stand then went straight to the secretaire felt the lock and #contrary# to his expectation found that the key was missing
there were two #door# he bolted them both it was only a precaution but the #glass# cutter was a prudent #man# who had provided for all emergencies
the #count# soon heard the rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys such as the locksmith brings when called to force a lock and which thieves call nightingales doubtless from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt
ah ha whispered $m_de_monte_cristo$ with a #smile# of disappointment he is only a thief but the #man# in the dark could not find the #right# key
he reached the instrument he had placed on the stand touched a spring and immediately a pale #light# just bright enough to render objects distinct was reflected on his #hand# and #countenance#
by heavens exclaimed $m_de_monte_cristo$ starting back it is $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ raised his hatchet dont stir whispered $m_de_monte_cristo$ and put down your hatchet we shall require no #arm#
then he added some #word# in a low #tone# for the exclamation which surprise had drawn from the #count# faint as it had been had startled the #man# who remained in the pose of the old knife grinder
it was an #order# the #count# had just given for immediately $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ went noiselessly and returned bearing a black dress and a three cornered hat
meanwhile $m_de_monte_cristo$ had rapidly taken off his greatcoat waistcoat and shirt and #one# might distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant tunic of steel mail of which the last in france where daggers are no longer dreaded was worn by #king# $louis_xviii$ xvi who feared the dagger at his breast and whose #head# was cleft with a hatchet
the tunic soon disappeared under a long cassock as did his #hair# under a #priest# wig the three cornered hat over this effectually transformed the #count# into an #abbé#
the #man# hearing #nothing# more stood erect and while $m_de_monte_cristo$ was completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire whose lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale
try again whispered the #count# who depended on the #secret# spring which was unknown to the picklock clever as he might be try again
the #man# whom he had seen seated on a fence had got down and was still pacing the #street# but strange as it appeared he cared not for those who might pass from the avenue of the champs élysées or by the $faubourg_saint_honoré$ his #attention# was engrossed with what was passing at the #count# and his only aim appeared to be to discern every movement in the dressing #room#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ suddenly struck his #finger# on his #forehead# and a #smile# passed over his #lip# then #drawing# near to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ he whispered
remain here concealed in the dark and whatever #noise# you hear whatever passes only come in or show yourself if i call you
you have a few #minute# #work# there and he advanced to the #window# $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ bowed in token of strict obedience
$m_de_monte_cristo$ then drew a lighted taper from a closet and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock silently opened the #door# taking #care# that the #light# should shine directly on his #face#
the #door# opened so quietly that the thief heard no #sound# but to his #astonishment# the #room# was suddenly illuminated he turned
ah good #evening# my dear $m_caderousse$ said $m_de_monte_cristo$ what are you doing here at such an #hour#
exclaimed $m_caderousse$ and not knowing how this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the #door# he let fall his bunch of keys and remained motionless and stupefied
the $abbé_busoni$ the #count# placed himself between $m_caderousse$ and the #window# thus cutting off from the thief his only #chance# of retreat
the $abbé_busoni$ repeated $m_caderousse$ fixing his haggard gaze on the #count# yes undoubtedly the $abbé_busoni$ himself replied $m_de_monte_cristo$
and i am very glad you recognize me dear $m_caderousse$ it proves you have a good memory for it must be about ten #year# since we last met
this calmness of $abbé_busoni$ combined with his irony and boldness staggered $m_caderousse$ the #abbé# the #abbé# murmured he clenching his fists and his teeth chattering
so you would rob the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ continued the false #abbé# reverend #sir# murmured $m_caderousse$ seeking to regain the #window# which the #count# pitilessly blocked reverend #sir#
i dont know believe me i take my oath a pane of #glass# out continued the #count# a dark lantern a bunch of false keys a secretaire #half# forced
it is tolerably evident $m_caderousse$ was choking he looked around for some #corner# to hide in some #way# of escape
come come continued the #count# i see you are still the same an assassin reverend #sir# since you know #everything# you know it was not
i it was $la_carconte$ that was proved at the trial since i was only condemned to the galleys
is your #time# then expired since i find you in a fair #way# to #return# there no reverend #sir# i have been liberated by someone
that someone has done society a great kindness ah said $m_caderousse$ i had promised and you are breaking your #promise#
interrupted $m_de_monte_cristo$ alas yes said $m_caderousse$ very uneasily a bad relapse that #will# lead you if i mistake not to the #place# de grève
so much the worse so much the worse diavolo as they say in my #country# reverend #sir# i am impelled
said $abbé_busoni$ disdainfully poverty may make a #man# beg steal a loaf of bread at a baker #door# but not cause him to open a secretaire in a $house_of_peers$ supposed to be inhabited
and when the jeweller johannes had just paid you #franc# for the #diamond# i had given you and you killed him to get the #diamond# and the #money# both was that also poverty
every criminal says the same #thing# poverty pshaw pardon reverend #sir# said $m_caderousse$ you have saved my #life# once save me again
that is but poor encouragement are you alone reverend #sir# or have you there #soldier# ready to seize me
and i #will# again have #pity# on you and #will# let you escape at the risk of the fresh miseries my weakness may lead to if you tell me the #truth#
i am alone said the #abbé# ah reverend #sir# cried $m_caderousse$ clasping his #hand# and #drawing# nearer to $m_de_monte_cristo$
i may indeed say you are my deliverer you #mean# to say you have been freed from confinement
yes that is true reverend #sir# who was your liberator an englishman what was his #name#
$lord_wilmore$ i know him i shall know if you lie ah reverend #sir# i tell you the simple #truth#
was this englishman protecting you no not me but a young corsican my #companion# what was this young corsican #name#
$m_benedetto$ is that his christian #name# he had no #other# he was a foundling then this young #man# escaped with you
he did in what #way# we were working at saint mandrier near toulon do you know saint mandrier
i do in the #hour# of #rest# between noon and #one# clock galley slaves having a nap after #dinner#
we may well #pity# the poor #fellow# said the #abbé# nay said $m_caderousse$ #one# cant always #work# #one# is not a dog
while the #rest# slept then we went away a short #distance# we severed our fetters with a file the englishman had given us and swam away
so much the better for the dogs said $m_de_monte_cristo$ and what is become of this $m_benedetto$
i dont know you ought to know no in #truth# we parted at hyères
and to give more weight to his protestation $m_caderousse$ advanced another #step# towards the #abbé# who remained motionless in his #place# as calm as ever and pursuing his interrogation
you lie said the $abbé_busoni$ with a #tone# of irresistible authority reverend #sir# you lie this #man# is still your #friend# and you perhaps make #use# of him as your accomplice
oh reverend #sir# since you left toulon what have you lived on #answer# me on what i could get
you lie repeated the #abbé# a third #time# with a still more imperative #tone# $m_caderousse$ terrified looked at the #count#
you have lived on the #money# he has given you true said $m_caderousse$ $m_benedetto$ has become the #son# of a great lord
how can he be the #son# of a great lord a natural #son# and what is that great lord #name#
the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ the very same in whose $house_of_peers$ we are $m_benedetto$ the #count# #son# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ astonished in his #turn#
well i should think so since the #count# has found him a false #father# since the #count# gives him four thousand #franc# a #month# and leaves him #franc# in his #will#
ah yes said the factitious #abbé# who began to understand and what #name# does the young #man# bear meanwhile
is it then that young #man# whom my #friend# the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ has received into his $house_of_peers$ and who is going to marry $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
$andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ exactly and you suffer that you wretch you who know his #life# and his #crime#
why should i stand in a comrade #way# said $m_caderousse$ you are #right# it is not you who should apprise $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ it is i
do not do so reverend #sir# why not because you would bring us to ruin
and you think that to save such villains as you i #will# become an abettor of their plot an accomplice in their #crime#
reverend #sir# said $m_caderousse$ #drawing# still nearer i #will# expose all to whom to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
cried $m_caderousse$ #drawing# from his waistcoat an open knife and striking the #count# in the breast you shall disclose #nothing# reverend #sir#
at the same #moment# the #count# seized with his left #hand# the assassin wrist and wrung it with such #strength# that the knife fell from his stiffened #finger# and $m_caderousse$ uttered a #cry# of pain
but the #count# disregarding his #cry# continued to wring the #bandit# wrist until his #arm# being dislocated he fell first on his knees then flat on the #floor#
by heaven to $m_caderousse$ great #astonishment# the knife instead of piercing the #count# breast flew back blunted the #count# then placed his #foot# on his #head# saying
i know not what restrains me from crushing thy skull rascal ah mercy mercy cried $m_caderousse$ the #count# withdrew his #foot#
what a wrist you have reverend #sir# said $m_caderousse$ stroking his #arm# all bruised by the fleshy pincers which had held it what a wrist
rise said he $m_caderousse$ rose #silence# god gives me #strength# to overcome a wild beast like you in the #name# of that god
i act remember that wretch and to spare thee at this #moment# is still serving him oh said $m_caderousse$ groaning with pain
take this pen and #paper# and write what i dictate i dont know how to write reverend #sir#
$m_caderousse$ awed by the superior #power# of the #abbé# sat down and wrote #sir# the #man# whom you are receiving at your $house_of_peers$ and to whom you intend to marry your #daughter# is a felon who escaped with me from confinement at toulon
you lie take this pen and write he was no and i no he was called $m_benedetto$ but he is ignorant of his real #name# having never known his parents
if i sought your ruin fool i should drag you to the first guard $house_of_peers$ besides when that #note# is delivered in all probability you #will# have no more to #fear#
#sign# it continued the #count# but would you ruin me #sign# it then $m_caderousse$ signed it
the address to $monsieur_cavalcanti$ the #baron# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #banker# rue de la chaussée antin $m_caderousse$ wrote the address the #abbé# took the #note#
now said he that suffices begone which #way# the #way# you came you #wish# me to get out at that #window#
you got in very well oh you have some design against me reverend #sir# idiot what design can i have
why then not let me out by the #door# what would be the advantage of waking the porter
ah reverend #sir# tell me do you #wish# me dead i #wish# what god #will# but swear that you #will# not strike me as i go down
cowardly fool what do you intend doing with me i ask you what can i do
i have tried to make you a happy #man# and you have turned out a murderer oh $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said $m_caderousse$ make #one# more attempt try me once more
i #will# said the #count# listen you know if i may be relied on yes said $m_caderousse$
if you arrive safely at home what have i to #fear# except from you if you reach your home safely leave paris leave france and wherever you may be
so long as you conduct yourself well i #will# send you a small annuity for if you #return# home safely then
then asked $m_caderousse$ shuddering then i shall believe god has forgiven you and i #will# forgive you too
as true as i am a christian stammered $m_caderousse$ you #will# make me die of fright now begone said the #count# pointing to the #window#
$m_caderousse$ scarcely yet relying on this #promise# put his legs out of the #window# and stood on the ladder now go down said the #abbé# folding his #arm#
then the #count# brought the taper to the #window# that it might be seen in the champs élysées that a #man# was getting out of the #window# while another held a #light#
understanding he had #nothing# more to #fear# from him $m_caderousse$ began to go down what are you doing reverend #sir#
he then descended but it was only when he felt his #foot# touch the #ground# that he was satisfied of his safety
$m_de_monte_cristo$ returned to his bedroom and glancing rapidly from the #garden# to the #street# he saw first $m_caderousse$ who after walking to the #end# of the #garden# fixed his ladder against the #wall# at a different #part# from where he came in
the #count# then looking over into the #street# saw the #man# who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction and #place# himself against the angle of the #wall# where $m_caderousse$ would come over
suppose a watchman should pass and he blew out the #light# $m_caderousse$ climbed the ladder slowly and looked over the coping to see if the #street# was quiet
then $m_caderousse$ sat astride the coping and #drawing# up his ladder passed it over the #wall# then he began to descend or rather to slide down by the two stanchions which he did with an ease which proved how accustomed he was to the exercise
no #one# could be seen or heard the clock of the invalides struck #one# but once started he could not stop
in vain did he see a #man# start from the #shadow# when he was halfway down in vain did he see an #arm# raised as he touched the #ground#
before he could defend himself that #arm# struck him so violently in the back that he let go the ladder crying help
then as he rolled on the #ground# his adversary seized him by the #hair# and struck him a third blow in the chest
this #time# $m_caderousse$ endeavored to call again but he could only utter a groan and he shuddered as the #blood# flowed from his three wounds
the assassin finding that he no longer cried out lifted his #head# up by the #hair# his #eye# were closed and the mouth was distorted
a second blow struck him almost immediately in the #side# and he fell calling help murder the murderer supposing him dead let fall his #head# and disappeared
then $m_caderousse$ #feeling# that he was leaving him raised himself on his elbow and with a dying #voice# cried with great #effort#
the #door# of the back #staircase# opened then the #side# #gate# of the #garden# and $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and his #master# were on the #spot# with #light#
murder i am dying help reverend #sir# help this mournful appeal pierced the #darkness# #chapter# the #hand# of god $m_caderousse$ continued to call piteously help reverend #sir# help
what is the #matter# asked $m_de_monte_cristo$ help cried $m_caderousse$ i am murdered we are here take courage
ah it all over you are come too late you are come to see me die what blows what #blood#
he fainted $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and his #master# conveyed the wounded #man# into a #room# $m_de_monte_cristo$ motioned to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ to undress him and he then examined his dreadful wounds
my god he exclaimed thy vengeance is sometimes delayed but only that it may fall the more effectually $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ looked at his #master# for further instructions
bring here immediately the #king# attorney $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who #life# in the $faubourg_saint_honoré$ as you pass the lodge wake the porter and send him for a surgeon
when the wretched #man# again opened his #eye# the #count# looked at him with a mournful #expression# of #pity# and his #lip# moved as if in prayer
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ obeyed leaving the #abbé# alone with $m_caderousse$ who had not yet revived a surgeon reverend #sir# a surgeon said $m_caderousse$
i have sent for #one# replied the #abbé# i know he cannot save my #life# but he may strengthen me to give my evidence
against whom against my murderer did you recognize him yes it was $m_benedetto$ the young corsican
after giving me the #plan# of this $house_of_peers$ doubtless hoping i should kill the #count# and he thus become his heir or that the #count# would kill me and i should be out of his #way# he waylaid me and has murdered me
himself your comrade yes i have also sent for the #procureur# he #will# not come in #time# i feel my #life# fast ebbing
wait a #moment# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ he left the #room# and returned in five #minute# with a phial the dying #man# #eye# were all the #time# riveted on the #door# through which he hoped succor would arrive
hasten reverend #sir# hasten i shall faint again $m_de_monte_cristo$ approached and dropped on his purple #lip# three or four drops of the contents of the phial
$m_caderousse$ drew a deep breath oh said he that is #life# to me more more two drops more would kill you replied the #abbé#
oh send for someone to whom i can denounce the wretch shall i write your deposition you can #sign# it
yes yes said $m_caderousse$ and his #eye# glistened at the #thought# of this posthumous revenge $m_de_monte_cristo$ wrote i die murdered by the corsican $m_benedetto$ my comrade in the galleys at toulon no
$m_de_monte_cristo$ gave the pen to $m_caderousse$ who collected all his #strength# signed it and fell back on his #bed# saying you #will# relate all the #rest# reverend #sir# you #will# say he calls himself $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$
quick quick said $m_caderousse$ or i shall be unable to #sign# it he lodges at the hôtel des princes
oh i am dying he again fainted the #abbé# made him smell the contents of the phial and he again opened his #eye#
his #desire# for revenge had not forsaken him ah you #will# tell all i have said #will# you not reverend #sir#
i #will# say he had doubtless given you the #plan# of this $house_of_peers$ in the #hope# the #count# would kill you
i #will# say likewise he had apprised the #count# by a #note# of your intention and the #count# being absent i read the #note# and sat up to await you
yes and much more what more #will# you say and he #will# be guillotined #will# be not said $m_caderousse$
i #will# say continued the #count# that he followed and watched you the whole #time# and when he saw you leave the $house_of_peers$ ran to the angle of the #wall# to conceal himself
#promise# me that and i #will# die with that #hope# did you see all that remember my #word#
if you #return# home safely i shall believe god has forgiven you and i #will# forgive you also and you did not warn me
cried $m_caderousse$ raising himself on his elbows you knew i should be killed on leaving this $house_of_peers$ and did not warn me
for i saw god #justice# placed in the #hand# of $m_benedetto$ and should have #thought# it sacrilege to oppose the designs of providence
no god #justice# speak not of it reverend #sir# if god were just you know how many would be punished who now escape
patience said the #abbé# in a #tone# which made the dying #man# shudder have patience $m_caderousse$ looked at him with amazement
besides said the #abbé# god is merciful to all as he has been to you he is first a #father# then a judge
do you then believe in god said $m_caderousse$ had i been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now said $m_de_monte_cristo$
listen said the #abbé# extending his #hand# over the wounded #man# as if to command him to believe this is what the god in whom on your #death# #bed# you refuse to believe has done for you
i must believe on seeing you $m_caderousse$ raised his clenched #hand# towards heaven he gave you health #strength# regular employment
even #friend# a #life# in #fact# which a #man# might enjoy with a calm conscience instead of improving these gifts rarely granted so abundantly
this has been your #course# you have given yourself up to sloth and drunkenness and in a fit of intoxication have ruined your best #friend#
help cried $m_caderousse$ i require a surgeon not a #priest# perhaps i am not mortally wounded i may not die perhaps they can yet save my #life#
your wounds are so far mortal that without the three drops i gave you you would now be dead
listen then ah murmured $m_caderousse$ what a strange #priest# you are you drive the dying to #despair# instead of consoling them
listen continued the #abbé# when you had betrayed your #friend# god began not to strike but to warn you
you had already passed #half# your #life# in coveting that which you might have honorably acquired and already you contemplated #crime# under the excuse of want when god worked a miracle in your behalf sending you by my #hand# a #fortune# brilliant indeed for you who had never possessed any
but this unexpected unhoped for unheard of #fortune# sufficed you no longer when you once possessed it you wished to double it and how by a murder
poverty overtook you you succeeded and then god snatched it from you and brought you to #justice# it was not i who wished to kill the jew said $m_caderousse$
it was $la_carconte$ yes said $m_de_monte_cristo$ and god i cannot say in #justice# for his #justice# would have slain you but god in his mercy spared your #life#
$pardieu$ to transport me for #life# how merciful you #thought# it a mercy then miserable wretch the coward who feared #death# rejoiced at perpetual disgrace for like all galley slaves you said
i may escape from #prison# i cannot from the grave and you said truly the #way# was opened for you unexpectedly
an englishman visited toulon who had vowed to rescue two #man# from infamy and his choice fell on you and your #companion#
you received a second #fortune# #money# and tranquillity were restored to you and you who had been condemned to a felon #life# might live as #other# #man#
i have not enough you said when you had more than you before possessed and you committed a third #crime# without #reason# without excuse
then wretched creature then you tempted god a third #time# god is wearied he has punished you $m_caderousse$ was fast sinking
give me drink said he i thirst i burn $m_de_monte_cristo$ gave him a #glass# of #water#
and yet that villain $m_benedetto$ #will# escape no #one# i tell you #will# escape $m_benedetto$ #will# be punished
then you too #will# be punished for you did not do your #duty# as a #priest# you should have prevented $m_benedetto$ from killing me
said the #count# with a #smile# which petrified the dying #man# when you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail which protected my breast
yet perhaps if i had found you humble and penitent i might have prevented $m_benedetto$ from killing you but i found you proud and #blood# thirsty and i left you in the #hand# of god
i i do not believe there is a god howled $m_caderousse$ you do not believe it you lie
you lie #silence# said the #abbé# you #will# force the last drop of #blood# from your veins what you do not believe in god when he is striking you dead
you #will# not believe in him who requires but a prayer a #word# a #tear# and he #will# forgive god who might have directed the assassin
dagger so as to #end# your career in a #moment# has given you this #quarter# of an #hour# for repentance
reflect then wretched #man# and repent no said $m_caderousse$ no i #will# not repent there is no god there is no providence
there is a providence there is a god said $m_de_monte_cristo$ of whom you are a striking #proof# as you lie in utter #despair# denying him while i stand before you rich happy safe and entreating that god in whom you endeavor not to believe while in your #heart# you still believe in him
all comes by #chance# but who are you then asked $m_caderousse$ fixing his dying #eye# on the #count#
#look# well at me said $m_de_monte_cristo$ putting the #light# near his #face# well the #abbé# the $abbé_busoni$
$m_de_monte_cristo$ took off the wig which disfigured him and let fall his black #hair# which added so much to the beauty of his pallid #feature#
oh said $m_caderousse$ thunderstruck but for that black #hair# i should say you were the englishman $lord_wilmore$
i am neither the $abbé_busoni$ nor $lord_wilmore$ said $m_de_monte_cristo$ think again do you not recollect me
there was a magic #effect# in the #count# #word# which once more revived the exhausted #power# of the miserable #man#
yes indeed said he i think i have seen you and known you formerly yes $m_caderousse$ you have seen me you knew me once
who then are you and why if you knew me do you let me die because #nothing# can save you your wounds are mortal
had it been possible to save you i should have considered it another #proof# of god mercy and i would again have endeavored to restore you i swear by my #father# tomb
by your #father# tomb said $m_caderousse$ supported by a supernatural #power# and #half# raising himself to see more distinctly the #man# who had just taken the oath which all #man# hold sacred who then are you
the #count# had watched the approach of #death# he knew this was the last struggle he approached the dying #man# and leaning over him with a calm and melancholy #look# he whispered
i am i am and his almost closed #lip# uttered a #name# so low that the #count# himself appeared afraid to hear it
$m_caderousse$ who had raised himself on his knees and stretched out his #arm# tried to draw back then clasping his #hand# and raising them with a desperate #effort#
pardon me for having denied thee thou dost exist thou art indeed #man# #father# in heaven and his judge on #earth#
oh my god my god said he my god my lord i have long despised thee pardon me my god receive me
oh my lord $m_caderousse$ sighed deeply and fell back with a groan the #blood# no longer flowed from his wounds he was dead
ten #minute# afterwards the surgeon and the #procureur# arrived the #one# accompanied by the porter the #other# by $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and were received by the $abbé_busoni$ who was praying by the #side# of the corpse
#one# said the #count# mysteriously his #eye# fixed on the corpse disfigured by so awful a #death# #chapter#
$m_beauchamp$ the daring attempt to rob the #count# was the topic of #conversation# throughout paris for the next fortnight the dying #man# had signed a deposition declaring $m_benedetto$ to be the assassin
$m_caderousse$ knife dark lantern bunch of keys and clothing excepting the waistcoat which could not be found were deposited at the registry the corpse was conveyed to the morgue
the #count# told #everyone# that this adventure had happened during his absence at $auteuil$ and that he only knew what was related by the $abbé_busoni$ who that #evening# by mere #chance# had requested to pass the #night# in his $house_of_peers$ to examine some valuable books in his library
$m_bertuccio$ alone turned pale whenever $m_benedetto$ #name# was mentioned in his #presence# but there was no #reason# why #anyone# should notice his doing so
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ being called on to prove the #crime# was preparing his brief with the same ardor that he was accustomed to exercise when required to speak in criminal #case#
but three weeks had already passed and the most diligent search had been unsuccessful the attempted robbery and the murder of the robber by his comrade were almost forgotten in anticipation of the approaching #marriage# of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to the #count# $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$
it was expected that this wedding would shortly take #place# as the young #man# was received at the #banker# as the betrothed
#letter# had been despatched to $monsieur_cavalcanti$ as the #count# #father# who highly approved of the union regretted his inability to leave parma at that #time# and promised a wedding gift of a hundred and fifty thousand livres
it was agreed that the three #million# should be intrusted to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to invest some #person# had warned the young #man# of the #circumstance# of his future #father# in #law# who had of late sustained repeated losses but with sublime disinterestedness and confidence the young #man# refused to listen or to express a single #doubt# to the #baron#
the #police# had #order# to make the strictest search for the murderer the #baron# adored #count# $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ not so $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
with an instinctive hatred of matrimony she suffered $andrea_rondolo$ #attention# in #order# to get rid of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but when $andrea_rondolo$ urged his suit she betrayed an entire dislike to him
the #baron# might possibly have perceived it but attributing it to a caprice feigned ignorance the delay demanded by $m_beauchamp$ had nearly expired
no #one# had taken up the remark about the general and no #one# had recognized in the #officer# who betrayed the castle of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ the noble #count# in the $house_of_peers$
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ appreciated the advice of $m_de_monte_cristo$ to let #thing# die away of their own accord $m_albert_de_morcerf$ however felt no less insulted the few #line# which had irritated him were certainly intended as an insult
besides the #manner# in which $m_beauchamp$ had closed the conference left a bitter recollection in his #heart# he cherished the #thought# of the duel hoping to conceal its true cause even from his seconds
$m_beauchamp$ had not been seen since the #day# he visited $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and those of whom the latter inquired always told him he was out on a journey which would detain him some #day#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ rubbed his #eye# ordered his #servant# to introduce him into the small smoking #room# on the #ground# #floor# dressed himself quickly and went down
where he was no #one# knew #one# #morning# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was awakened by his #valet# de chambre who announced $m_beauchamp$ he found $m_beauchamp$ pacing the #room# on perceiving him $m_beauchamp$ stopped
tell me may i shake #hand# with you saying $m_beauchamp$ acknowledge you have injured me and retain my friendship or must i simply propose to you a choice of #arm#
your arrival here without waiting my #visit# at your $house_of_peers$ #today# #look# well #sir# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ albert said $m_beauchamp$ with a #look# of sorrow which stupefied the young #man# let us first sit down and talk
rather #sir# before we sit down i must demand your #answer# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said the journalist these are #question# which it is difficult to #answer#
i #will# facilitate it by repeating the #question# #will# you or #will# you not retract $m_albert_de_morcerf$ it is not enough to #answer#
yes or no to #question# which concern the #honor# the social #interest# and the #life# of such a #man# as lieutenant général the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ peer of france
what must then be done what i have done $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i reasoned thus #money# #time# and fatigue are #nothing# compared with the reputation and #interest# of a whole #family#
if i strike with the sword or discharge the contents of a #pistol# at #man# with whom for three #year# i have been on terms of intimacy i must at least know why i do so
i must meet him with a #heart# at ease and that quiet conscience which a #man# needs when his own #arm# must save his #life#
probabilities #will# not suffice only #fact# #will# justify a deadly combat with a #friend# well said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ impatiently
what does all this #mean# it #mean# that i have just returned from $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ from $ali_pasha_of_yanina$
yes impossible here is my passport examine the visa geneva milan venice trieste delvino $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ #will# you believe the government of a republic a kingdom and an empire
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ cast his #eye# on the passport then raised them in #astonishment# to $m_beauchamp$ you have been to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ said he
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ had you been a #stranger# a foreigner a simple lord like that englishman who came to demand satisfaction three or four #month# since and whom i killed to get rid of i should not have taken this trouble but i #thought# this mark of consideration due to you
i took a week to go another to #return# four #day# of quarantine and forty eight #hour# to stay there that makes three weeks
i returned last #night# and here i am what circumlocution how long you are before you tell me what i most #wish# to know
because in #truth# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ you hesitate yes i #fear# you #fear# to acknowledge that your correspondent has deceived you
not so murmured the journalist on the #contrary# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ turned frightfully pale he endeavored to speak but the #word# died on his #lip#
oh no self #love# $m_beauchamp$ acknowledge it $m_beauchamp$ your courage cannot be doubted my #friend# said $m_beauchamp$ in the most affectionate #tone# i should gladly make an apology but alas
but what the paragraph was correct my #friend# what that french #officer# yes $m_fernand_mondego$
yes the traitor who surrendered the castle of the #man# in whose #service# he was pardon me my #friend# that #man# was your #father#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ advanced furiously towards $m_beauchamp$ but the latter restrained him more by a mild #look# than by his extended #hand#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ opened the #paper# it was an attestation of four notable inhabitants of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ proving that colonel $m_fernand_mondego$ in the #service# of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ tepelini had surrendered the castle for two #million# crowns
my #friend# said he here is a #proof# of it the signatures were perfectly legal $m_albert_de_morcerf$ tottered and fell overpowered in a #chair#
it could no longer be doubted the #family# #name# was fully given after a #moment# mournful #silence# his #heart# overflowed and he gave #way# to a flood of #tear#
$m_beauchamp$ who had watched with sincere #pity# the young #man# paroxysm of #grief# approached him now $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said he
i wished to see all and to judge of #everything# for myself hoping the explanation would be in your #father# favor and that i might do him #justice#
but on the #contrary# the particulars which are given prove that $m_fernand_mondego$ raised by $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ to the rank of #governor# general is no #other# than #count# $m_fernand_mondego$ of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ then recollecting the #honor# you had done me in admitting me to your friendship i hastened to you
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ still extended on the #chair# covered his #face# with both #hand# as if to prevent the #light# from reaching him
i hastened to you continued $m_beauchamp$ to tell you $m_albert_de_morcerf$ that in this changing #age# the faults of a #father# cannot revert upon his #child#
few have passed through this revolutionary period in the midst of which we were born without some stain of infamy or #blood# to soil the uniform of the #soldier# or the gown of the #magistrate#
now i have these #proof# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and i am in your confidence no human #power# can force me to a duel which your own conscience would reproach you with as criminal but i come to offer you what you can no longer demand of me
you understand me do you not do you #wish# these #proof# these attestations which i alone possess to be destroyed
do you #wish# this frightful #secret# to remain with us confided to me it shall never escape my #lip# say $m_albert_de_morcerf$ my #friend# do you #wish# it
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ threw himself on $m_beauchamp$ neck ah noble #fellow# cried he take these said $m_beauchamp$ presenting the #paper# to $m_albert_de_morcerf$
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ seized them with a convulsive #hand# tore them in #piece# and trembling lest the least vestige should escape and #one# #day# appear to confront him he approached the wax #light# always kept burning for cigars and burned every fragment
dear excellent #friend# murmured $m_albert_de_morcerf$ still burning the #paper# let all be forgotten as a sorrowful #dream# said $m_beauchamp$
let it vanish as the last sparks from the blackened #paper# and disappear as the smoke from those silent ashes
and may there remain only the eternal friendship which i promised to my deliverer which shall be transmitted to our #child#
yes yes said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #child# and shall always remind me that i owe my #life# and the #honor# of my #name# to you for
had this been known oh $m_beauchamp$ i should have destroyed myself or no my poor #mother# i could not have killed her by the same blow i should have fled from my #country#
dear $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said $m_beauchamp$ but this sudden and factitious #joy# soon forsook the young #man# and was succeeded by a still greater #grief#
well said $m_beauchamp$ what still oppresses you my #friend# i am broken hearted said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ listen $m_beauchamp$
i cannot thus in a #moment# relinquish the respect the confidence and pride with which a #father# untarnished #name# inspires a #son#
oh $m_beauchamp$ beauchamp how shall i now approach mine shall i draw back my #forehead# from his embrace or withhold my #hand# from his
i am the most wretched of #man# ah my #mother# my poor #mother# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ gazing through his #tear# at his #mother# portrait
if you know this how much must you suffer come said $m_beauchamp$ taking both his #hand# take courage my #friend#
but how came that first #note# to be inserted in your journal some unknown #enemy# an invisible foe has done this
let no trace of #emotion# be visible on your #countenance# bear your #grief# as the cloud bears within it ruin and #death# a fatal #secret# known only when the storm bursts
the more must you fortify yourself $m_albert_de_morcerf$ go my #friend# reserve your #strength# for the #moment# when the crash shall come
you think then all is not over yet said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ horror stricken i think #nothing# my #friend# but all #thing# are possible
by the #way# what said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ seeing that $m_beauchamp$ hesitated are you going to marry $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
why do you ask me now because the rupture or fulfilment of this engagement is connected with the #person# of whom we were speaking
how said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ whose #brow# reddened you think $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i ask you only how your engagement stands
pray put no construction on my #word# i do not #mean# they should convey and give them no undue weight
no said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ the engagement is broken off well said $m_beauchamp$ then seeing the young #man# was about to relapse into melancholy let us go out $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said he
a ride in the wood in the phaeton or on horseback #will# refresh you we #will# then #return# to breakfast and you shall attend to your #affair# and i to mine
willingly said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but let us walk i think a little exertion would do me good the two #friend# walked out on the fortress
since we are out said $m_beauchamp$ let us call on de $m_de_monte_cristo$ he is admirably adapted to revive #one# spirits because he never interrogates and in my #opinion# those who ask no #question# are the best comforters
when they arrived at the madeleine gladly said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ let us call i #love# him #chapter#
the journey $m_de_monte_cristo$ uttered a joyful exclamation on seeing the young #man# together ah ha said he i #hope# all is over explained and settled
the absurd reports have died away and should they be renewed i would be the first to oppose them so let us speak no more of it
yes said $m_beauchamp$ $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #will# tell you replied the #count# that i gave him the same advice #look# added he
i am finishing the most execrable #morning# #work# what is it said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ arranging your #paper# apparently
my #paper# #thank# god no my #paper# are all in capital #order# because i have none but $monsieur_cavalcanti$ m $monsieur_cavalcanti$
asked $m_beauchamp$ yes do you not know that this is a young #man# whom the #count# is introducing said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
let us not misunderstand each #other# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ i introduce no #one# and certainly not $monsieur_cavalcanti$
and who said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with a forced #smile# is to marry $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ instead of me which grieves me cruelly
what $monsieur_cavalcanti$ is going to marry $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ asked $m_beauchamp$ certainly do you come from the #end# of the #world# said $m_de_monte_cristo$
you a journalist the #husband# of renown it is the talk of all paris and you #count# have made this match asked $m_beauchamp$
i #silence# purveyor of gossip do not spread that report i make a match no you do not know me i have done all in my #power# to oppose it
ah i understand said $m_beauchamp$ on our #friend# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #account# on my #account# said the young #man#
oh no indeed the #count# #will# do me the #justice# to assert that i have on the #contrary# always entreated him to break off my engagement and happily it is ended
the #count# pretends i have not him to #thank# so be it i #will# erect an altar deo ignoto
i have had little to do with it for i am at variance both with the #father# in #law# and the young #man# there is only $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who appears but little charmed with the #thought# of matrimony and who seeing how little i was disposed to persuade her to renounce her dear #liberty# retains any affection for me
listen said $m_de_monte_cristo$ and do you say this wedding is at #hand# oh yes in #spite# of all i could say
i do not know the young #man# he is said to be of good #family# and rich but i never trust to vague assertions
i have even informed him of a #circumstance# i consider very serious the young #man# was either charmed by his nurse stolen by gypsies or lost by his tutor i scarcely know which
but i do know his #father# lost #sight# of him for more than ten #year# what he did during these ten #year# god only knows
i have warned $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ of it till i am tired but he is fascinated with his luccanese well all that was useless
they have commissioned me to write to the major to demand #paper# and here they are i send them but like pilate washing my #hand#
and what does $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ armilly say to you for robbing her of her pupil oh well i dont know but i understand that she is going to italy
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ asked me for #letter# of recommendation for the impresari i gave her a few #line# for the director of the valle theatre who is under some obligation to me
but what is the #matter# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ you #look# dull are you after all unconsciously in #love# with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i am not aware of it said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ smiling sorrowfully
$m_beauchamp$ turned to #look# at some paintings but continued $m_de_monte_cristo$ you are not in your usual spirits
i have a dreadful headache said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ well my dear viscount said $m_de_monte_cristo$ i have an infallible remedy to propose to you
what is that asked the young #man# a change indeed said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ yes and as i am just now excessively annoyed i shall go from home
shall we go together you annoyed #count# said $m_beauchamp$ and by what ah you think very lightly of it i should like to see you with a brief preparing in your $house_of_peers$
what brief the #one# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ is preparing against my amiable assassin some brigand escaped from the gallows apparently
true said $m_beauchamp$ i saw it in the #paper# who is this $m_caderousse$ some provençal it appears
consequently the #procureur# is very active in the #affair# and the prefect of #police# very much interested and #thank# to that #interest# for which i am very grateful they send me all the robbers of paris and the neighborhood under pretence of their being $m_caderousse$ murderers so that in three #month# if this continues every robber and assassin in france #will# have the #plan# of my $house_of_peers$ at his #finger# #end#
i am resolved to desert them and go to some remote #corner# of the #earth# and shall be happy if you #will# accompany me viscount
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ heard of him at marseilles and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ recollects having seen him willingly then it is settled
i have told you where the #air# is pure where every #sound# soothes where #one# is sure to be humbled however proud may be his #nature#
yes but where i #love# that humiliation i who am #master# of the universe as was augustus
i was rocked when an infant in the #arm# of old ocean and on the bosom of the beautiful amphitrite i have sported with the green mantle of the #one# and the azure robe of the #other# i #love# the #sea# as a mistress and pine if i do not often see her
but where are you really going to #sea# viscount you know i am a #sailor# let us go #count#
well viscount there #will# be in my courtyard this #evening# a good travelling britzka with four post #horse# in which #one# may #rest# as in a #bed#
to #sea# yes you accept my proposal i do $m_beauchamp$ it holds four very well #will# you accompany us
#thank# you i have just returned from #sea# what you have been to #sea# yes i have just made a little excursion to the borromean #island#
what of that come with us said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ no dear $m_albert_de_morcerf$ you know i only refuse when the #thing# is impossible
besides it is important added he in a low #tone# that i should remain in paris just now to watch the #paper#
ah you are a good and an excellent #friend# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ yes you are #right# watch watch $m_beauchamp$ and try to discover the #enemy# who made this disclosure
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ and $m_beauchamp$ parted the last pressure of their #hand# expressing what their tongues could not before a #stranger#
$m_beauchamp$ is a worthy #fellow# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ when the journalist was gone is he not $m_albert_de_morcerf$ yes and a sincere #friend#
i #love# him devotedly but now we are alone although it is immaterial to me where are we going into normandy if you like
delightful shall we be quite retired have no society no neighbors our #companion# #will# be riding #horse# dogs to hunt with and a fishing #boat#
exactly what i #wish# for i #will# apprise my #mother# of my intention and #return# to you
yes i am aware you may go alone since i once met you in italy but to accompany the mysterious $m_de_monte_cristo$
but shall you be allowed to go into normandy i may go where i please you forget #count# that i have often told you of the deep #interest# my #mother# takes in you
said francis i #woman# is like a wave of the #sea# said shakespeare both the great #king# and the great poet ought to have known #woman# #nature# well
#woman# is fickle #woman# yes my #mother# is not #woman# but a #woman#
as i am only a humble foreigner you must pardon me if i do not understand all the subtle refinements of your language
what i #mean# to say is that my #mother# is not quick to give her confidence but when she does she never changes
ah yes indeed said $m_de_monte_cristo$ with a sigh and do you think she is in the least interested in me
i repeat it you must really be a very strange and superior #man# for my #mother# is so absorbed by the #interest# you have excited that when i am with her she speaks of no #one# else
and does she try to make you dislike me on the #contrary# she often says
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ i believe the #count# has a noble #nature# try to gain his esteem indeed said $m_de_monte_cristo$ sighing
you see then said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ that instead of opposing she #will# encourage me adieu then until five clock be punctual and we shall arrive at twelve or #one#
at tréport yes or in the neighborhood but can we travel forty eight leagues in eight #hour#
you are certainly a prodigy you #will# soon not only surpass the railway which would not be very difficult in france but even the telegraph
easily said $m_de_monte_cristo$ but viscount since we cannot perform the journey in less than seven or eight #hour# do not keep me waiting
do not #fear# i have little to prepare $m_de_monte_cristo$ smiled as he nodded to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ then remained a #moment# absorbed in deep meditation
but passing his #hand# across his #forehead# as if to dispel his reverie he rang the bell twice and $m_bertuccio$ entered
$m_bertuccio$ said he i intend going this #evening# to normandy instead of #tomorrow# or the next #day# you #will# have sufficient #time# before five clock despatch a messenger to apprise the grooms at the first station
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ #will# accompany me $m_bertuccio$ obeyed and despatched a courier to pontoise to say the travelling #carriage# would arrive at six clock
from pontoise another express was sent to the next stage and in six #hour# all the #horse# stationed on the #road# were ready
before his departure the #count# went to $haydée$ #apartment# told her his intention and resigned #everything# to her #care# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was punctual
truly said $m_de_monte_cristo$ with your post #horse# going at the rate of two leagues an #hour# and that absurd #law# that #one# #traveller# shall not pass another without permission so that an invalid or ill tempered #traveller# may detain those who are well and active it is impossible to move i escape this annoyance by travelling with my own postilion and #horse# do i not $ali_pasha_of_yanina$
the journey soon became interesting from its rapidity of which $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had formed no previous #idea# the #count# put his #head# out of the #window# and whistled and the #horse# appeared to fly
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ smiling repeated the #sound# grasped the reins with a firm #hand# and spurred his #horse# whose beautiful manes floated in the breeze
this #child# of the desert was in his element and with his black #face# and sparkling #eye# appeared in the cloud of dust he raised like the genius of the simoom and the god of the hurricane
the #carriage# rolled with a thundering #noise# over the pavement and #everyone# turned to notice the dazzling meteor i never knew till now the delight of speed said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and the last cloud disappeared from his #brow#
but where the devil do you get such #horse# are they made to #order# precisely said the #count#
the thirty two that we shall #use# tonight are its progeny they are all entirely black with the exception of a star upon the #forehead#
six #year# since i bought a #horse# in hungary remarkable for its swiftness that is perfectly admirable but what do you do #count# with all these #horse#
when i no longer require them $m_bertuccio$ #will# sell them and he expects to realize thirty or forty thousand #franc# by the sale
you see i travel with them but you are not always travelling but no monarch in europe #will# be wealthy enough to purchase them
then he #will# sell them to some eastern vizier who #will# empty his coffers to purchase them and refill them by applying the bastinado to his #subject#
#count# may i suggest #one# #idea# to you certainly it is that next to you $m_bertuccio$ must be the richest #gentleman# in europe
you are mistaken viscount i believe he has not a #franc# in his #possession# then he must be a wonder
my dear #count# if you tell me many more marvellous #thing# i warn you i shall not believe them
i #countenance# #nothing# that is marvellous $m_albert_de_morcerf$ tell me why does a steward rob his #master# because i suppose it is his #nature# to do so for the #love# of robbing
you are mistaken it is because he has a #wife# and #family# and ambitious #desire# for himself and them
now $m_bertuccio$ is alone in the #world# he uses my property without accounting for the #use# he makes of it he is sure never to leave my #service#
also because he is not sure of always retaining his situation and #wish# to provide for the future why
because i should never get a better probabilities are deceptive but i deal in certainties he is the best #servant# over whom #one# has the #power# of #life# and #death#
do you possess that #right# over $m_bertuccio$ yes there are #word# which close a #conversation# with an #iron# #door# such was the #count#
the whole journey was performed with equal rapidity the thirty two #horse# dispersed over seven stages brought them to their destination in eight #hour#
yes at midnight they arrived at the #gate# of a beautiful park the porter was in attendance he had been apprised by the groom of the last stage of the #count# approach
the #servant# who had travelled at the back of the #carriage# waited on him $monsieur_baptistin$ who rode in front attended the #count#
at #half# past two in the #morning# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was conducted to his #apartment# where a bath and supper were prepared $m_albert_de_morcerf$ bathed took his supper and went to #bed#
on rising he went to his #window# which opened on a terrace having the #sea# in front and at the back a pretty park bounded by a small forest
in a creek lay a little sloop with a narrow keel and high masts bearing on its flag the $m_de_monte_cristo$ #arm# which were a mountain or on a #sea# azure with a cross gules in chief which might be an allusion to his #name# that recalled calvary the mount rendered by our lord
all #night# he was lulled by the melancholy #noise# of the surf passion more precious than #gold# and to the degrading cross which his #blood# had rendered holy or
around the schooner lay a number of small fishing #boat# belonging to the fishermen of the neighboring village like humble #subject# awaiting #order# from their queen
there as in every #spot# where $m_de_monte_cristo$ stopped if but for two #day# luxury abounded and #life# went on with the utmost ease
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ found in his anteroom two guns with all the accoutrements for hunting a lofty #room# on the #ground# #floor# containing all the ingenious instruments
it might be some personal remembrance of suffering and regeneration buried in the #night# of this mysterious personage pas #life# the english eminent in piscatory pursuits since they are patient and sluggish have invented for fishing
they killed a dozen pheasants in the park as many trout in the stream dined in a summer $house_of_peers$ overlooking the ocean and took tea in the library
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ completely exhausted with the exercise which invigorated $m_de_monte_cristo$ was sleeping in an armchair near the #window# while the #count# was designing with his architect the #plan# of a conservatory in his $house_of_peers$ when the #sound# of a #horse# at full speed on the high #road# made $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #look# up
he was disagreeably surprised to see his own #valet# de chambre whom he had not brought that he might not inconvenience $m_de_monte_cristo$
the #day# passed in pursuing those exercises in which $m_de_monte_cristo$ excelled towards the #evening# of the third #day# florentin here
$m_de_monte_cristo$ watched and saw him approach the #valet# who drew a small sealed parcel from his #pocket# containing a newspaper and a #letter#
cried he starting up is my #mother# ill and he hastened to the #door# from whom is this said he eagerly
yes #sir# he sent for me to his $house_of_peers$ gave me #money# for my journey procured a #horse# and made me #promise# not to stop till i had reached you i have come in fifteen #hour#
from $m_beauchamp$ replied florentin did he send you $m_albert_de_morcerf$ opened the #letter# with #fear# uttered a shriek on reading the first #line# and seized the #paper#
his #sight# was dimmed his legs sank under him and he would have fallen had not florentin supported him poor young #man# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ in a low #voice#
it is then true that the sin of the #father# shall fall on the #child# to the third and fourth generation
meanwhile $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had revived and continuing to read he threw back his #head# saying florentin is your #horse# fit to #return# immediately
all was quiet but on returning from $m_beauchamp$ i found #madame# in #tear# she had sent for me to know when you would #return#
i told her my #order# from $m_beauchamp$ she first extended her #arm# to prevent me but after a #moment# reflection
it is a poor lame post #horse# in what state was the $house_of_peers$ when you left yes go florentin said she
and may he come quickly yes my #mother# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i #will# #return# and woe to the infamous wretch
but first of all i must get there he went back to the #room# where he had left $m_de_monte_cristo$
his #voice# had become rough and hoarse his #face# was furrowed with wrinkles his #eye# burned under the blue veined lids and he tottered like a drunken #man#
five #minute# had sufficed to make a complete transformation in his #appearance# #count# said he i #thank# you for your hospitality which i would gladly have enjoyed longer but i must #return# to paris
what has happened a great #misfortune# more important to me than #life# dont #question# me i beg of you but lend me a #horse#
my stables are at your command viscount but you #will# kill yourself by riding on horseback take a post chaise or a #carriage#
no it would delay me and i need the fatigue you warn me of it #will# do me good
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ reeled as if he had been shot and fell on a #chair# near the #door# $m_de_monte_cristo$ did not see this second manifestation of physical exhaustion he was at the #window# calling
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ a #horse# for de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ quick he is in a hurry these #word# restored $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he darted from the #room# followed by the #count#
#thank# you cried he throwing himself on his #horse# #return# as soon as you can florentin must i #use# any password to procure a #horse#
you may think my departure strange and foolish said the young #man# you do not know how a paragraph in a newspaper may exasperate #one#
only dismount another #will# be immediately saddled $m_albert_de_morcerf$ hesitated a #moment# read that said he when i am gone that you may not be witness of my anger
while the #count# picked up the #paper# he put spurs to his #horse# which leaped in #astonishment# at such an unusual stimulus and shot away with the rapidity of an arrow
the french #officer# in the #service# of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ alluded to three weeks since in impartial who not only surrendered the castle of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ but sold his benefactor to the turks styled himself truly at that #time# $m_fernand_mondego$ as our esteemed contemporary states but he has since added to his christian #name# a title of nobility and a #family# #name#
the #count# watched him with a #feeling# of compassion and when he had completely disappeared read as follows he now calls himself the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and ranks among the peers
thus the terrible #secret# which $m_beauchamp$ had so generously destroyed appeared again like an armed phantom and another #paper# deriving its information from some malicious source had published two #day# after $m_albert_de_morcerf$ departure for normandy
the few #line# which had rendered the unfortunate young #man# almost crazy #chapter# the trial at eight clock in the #morning# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had arrived at $m_beauchamp$ #door#
the #valet# de chambre had received #order# to usher him in at once $m_beauchamp$ was in his bath here i am $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said
well my poor #friend# replied $m_beauchamp$ i expected you i need not say i think you are too faithful and too kind to have spoken of that painful #circumstance#
your having sent for me is another #proof# of your affection so without losing #time# tell me have you the slightest #idea# whence this terrible blow proceeds
i think i have some clew but first tell me all the particulars of this shameful plot
two #day# previously the article had appeared in another #paper# besides impartial and what was more serious #one# that was well known as a government #paper#
$m_beauchamp$ proceeded to relate to the young #man# who was overwhelmed with shame and #grief# the following #fact# $m_beauchamp$ was breakfasting when he read the paragraph
he sent immediately for a cabriolet and hastened to the publisher office although professing diametrically opposite principles from those of the editor of the #other# #paper# $m_beauchamp$ as it sometimes
the editor was reading with apparent delight a leading article in the same #paper# on beet sugar probably a composition of his own
said $m_beauchamp$ with the #paper# in your #hand# my #friend# i need not tell you the cause of my #visit#
we may say often happens was his intimate #friend# ah $pardieu$ are you interested in the sugar #question# asked the editor of the ministerial #paper#
no replied $m_beauchamp$ i have not considered the #question# a totally different #subject# #interest# me what is it
the article relative to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ indeed is it not a curious #affair# so curious that i think you are running a great risk of a prosecution for defamation of character
not at all we have received with the information all the requisite #proof# and we are quite sure de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #will# not raise his #voice# against us besides it is rendering a #service# to #one# #country# to denounce these wretched criminals who are unworthy of the #honor# bestowed on them
for my #paper# which gave the first information on the #subject# has been obliged to stop for want of #proof# and yet we are more interested than you in exposing de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ as he is a peer of france and we are of the opposition
$m_beauchamp$ was thunderstruck who then has so correctly informed you asked he oh that is very simple we have not sought to scandalize
a #man# arrived #yesterday# from $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ bringing a formidable array of documents and when we hesitated to publish the accusatory article he told us it should be inserted in some #other# #paper#
this news was brought to us $m_beauchamp$ understood that #nothing# remained but to submit and left the office to despatch a courier to $m_albert_de_morcerf$
but he had been unable to send to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ the following particulars as the #event# had transpired after the messenger departure namely that the same #day# a great agitation was manifest in the $house_of_peers$ among the usually calm members of that dignified assembly
#everyone# had arrived almost before the usual #hour# and was conversing on the melancholy #event# which was to attract the #attention# of the public towards #one# of their most illustrious colleagues
some were perusing the article #other# making comments and recalling #circumstance# which substantiated the charges still more the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was no favorite with his colleagues
like all upstarts he had had recourse to a great deal of haughtiness to maintain his #position# the true nobility laughed at him the talented repelled him and the honorable instinctively despised him
he was in #fact# in the unhappy #position# of the victim marked for sacrifice the #finger# of god once pointed at him #everyone# was prepared to raise the hue and #cry#
he did not take in the #paper# containing the defamatory article and had passed the #morning# in writing #letter# and in trying a #horse#
he arrived at his usual #hour# with a proud #look# and insolent demeanor he alighted passed through the corridors and entered the $house_of_peers$ without observing the hesitation of the #door# keepers or the coolness of his colleagues
the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ alone was ignorant of the news #business# had already been going on for #half# an #hour# when he entered
at #length# an honorable peer $m_albert_de_morcerf$ acknowledged #enemy# ascended the tribune with that solemnity which announced that the expected #moment# had arrived
there was an impressive #silence# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ alone knew not why such profound #attention# was given to an orator who was not always listened to with so much complacency
the #count# did not notice the introduction in which the speaker announced that his communication would be of that vital importance that it demanded the undivided #attention# of the $house_of_peers$ but at the mention of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and colonel $m_fernand_mondego$ he turned so frightfully pale that every member shuddered and fixed his #eye# upon him
moral wounds have this peculiarity they may be hidden but they never close always painful always ready to bleed when touched they remain fresh and open in the #heart#
the article having been read during the painful hush that followed a universal shudder pervaded the assembly and immediately the closest #attention# was given to the orator as he resumed his remarks
he stated his scruples and the difficulties of the #case# it was the #honor# of de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and that of the whole $house_of_peers$ he proposed to defend by provoking a debate on personal #question# which are always such painful themes of discussion
he concluded by calling for an investigation which might dispose of the calumnious report before it had #time# to spread and restore de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ to the #position# he had long held in public #opinion#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ was so completely overwhelmed by this great and unexpected calamity that he could scarcely stammer a few #word# as he looked around on the assembly
this timidity which might proceed from the #astonishment# of innocence as well as the shame of guilt conciliated some in his favor for #man# who are truly generous are always ready to compassionate when the #misfortune# of their #enemy# surpasses the limits of their hatred
#everyone# held the accusing #paper# but as usual no #one# liked to take upon himself the responsibility of the attack the #president# put it to the vote and it was decided that the investigation should take #place#
the #count# was asked what #time# he required to prepare his defence $m_albert_de_morcerf$ courage had revived when he found himself alive after this horrible blow
my lords answered he it is not by #time# i could repel the attack made on me by #enemy# unknown to me and doubtless hidden in obscurity it is immediately and by a thunderbolt that i must repel the flash of lightning which for a #moment# startled me
oh that i could instead of taking up this defence shed my last drop of #blood# to prove to my noble colleagues that i am their equal in worth
i demand then that the examination shall take #place# as soon as possible and i #will# furnish the $house_of_peers$ with all necessary information
these #word# made a favorable impression on behalf of the accused what #day# do you fix
asked the #president# #today# i am at your #service# replied the #count# the #president# rang the bell does the $house_of_peers$ approve that the examination should take #place# #today#
yes was the unanimous #answer# a committee of twelve members was chosen to examine the #proof# brought forward by $m_albert_de_morcerf$
the investigation would begin at eight clock that #evening# in the committee #room# and if postponement were necessary the proceedings would be resumed each #evening# at the same #hour#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ asked leave to retire he had to collect the documents he had long been preparing against this storm which his sagacity had foreseen
$m_beauchamp$ related to the young #man# all the #fact# we have just narrated his #story# however had over ours all the advantage of the animation of living #thing# over the coldness of dead #thing#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ listened trembling now with #hope# then with anger and then again with shame for from $m_beauchamp$ confidence he knew his #father# was guilty and he asked himself how since he was guilty he could prove his innocence
$m_beauchamp$ hesitated to continue his narrative what next asked $m_albert_de_morcerf$ what next my #friend# you impose a painful task on me
must you know all absolutely and rather from your #lip# than another muster up all your courage then for never have you required it more
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ passed his #hand# over his #forehead# as if to try his #strength# as a #man# who is preparing to defend his #life# proves his shield and bends his sword
he #thought# himself strong enough for he mistook fever for energy go on said he the #evening# arrived all paris was in expectation
many said your #father# had only to show himself to crush the charge against him many #other# said he would not appear while some asserted that they had seen him start for brussels and #other# went to the #police# office to inquire if he had taken out a passport
i used all my influence with #one# of the committee a young peer of my acquaintance to get admission to #one# of the galleries
he called for me at seven clock and before #anyone# had arrived asked #one# of the #door# keepers to #place# me in a #box#
i was concealed by a column and might witness the whole of the terrible #scene# which was about to take #place#
he held some #paper# in his #hand# his #countenance# was calm and his #step# firm and he was dressed with great #care# in his military uniform which was buttoned completely up to the chin
at eight clock all were in their #place# and de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ entered at the last stroke his #presence# produced a good #effect#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ felt his #heart# bursting at these particulars but gratitude mingled with his sorrow he would gladly have embraced those who had given his #father# this #proof# of esteem at a #moment# when his #honor# was so powerfully attacked
the committee was made up of liberals several of whom came forward to shake #hand# with him at this #moment# #one# of the #door# keepers brought in a #letter# for the #president#
you are at #liberty# to speak de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said the #president# as he unsealed the #letter# and the #count# began his defence i assure you $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in a most eloquent and skilful #manner#
he produced documents proving that the vizier of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ had up to the last #moment# honored him with his entire confidence since he had interested him with a negotiation of #life# and #death# with the emperor
he produced the ring his mark of authority with which $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ generally sealed his #letter# and which the latter had given him that he might on his #return# at any #hour# of the #day# or #night# gain access to the #presence# even in the harem
unfortunately the negotiation failed and when he returned to defend his benefactor he was dead but said the #count#
so great was $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ confidence that on his #death# #bed# he resigned his favorite mistress and her #daughter# to my #care#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ started on hearing these #word# the history of $haydée$ recurred to him and he remembered what she had said of that message and the ring and the #manner# in which she had been sold and made a slave
and what #effect# did this discourse produce anxiously inquired $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i acknowledge it affected me and indeed all the committee also said $m_beauchamp$
meanwhile the #president# carelessly opened the #letter# which had been brought to him but the first #line# aroused his #attention# he read them again and again and fixing his #eye# on de $m_albert_de_morcerf$
#count# said he you have said that the vizier of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ confided his #wife# and #daughter# to your #care# yes #sir# replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$
on my #return# $vasiliki$ and her #daughter# $haydée$ had disappeared did you know them my intimacy with the pasha and his unlimited confidence had gained me an introduction to them and i had seen them above twenty #time#
but in that like all the #rest# #misfortune# pursued me have you any #idea# what became of them yes #sir#
i heard they had fallen victims to their sorrow and perhaps to their poverty i was not rich my #life# was in constant danger i could not seek them to my great regret
the #president# frowned imperceptibly #gentleman# said he you have heard the comte de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ defence can you #sir# produce any witnesses to the #truth# of what you have asserted alas no $monsieur_cavalcanti$ replied the #count#
all those who surrounded the vizier or who knew me at his #court# are either dead or gone away i know not where
i have only the #letter# of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ tepelini which i have placed before you the ring a token of his good #will# which is here and lastly the most convincing #proof# i can offer after an anonymous attack and that is the absence of any witness against my veracity and the purity of my military #life#
a murmur of approbation ran through the assembly and at this #moment# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had #nothing# more transpired your #father# cause had been gained
it only remained to put it to the vote when the #president# resumed #gentleman# and you $monsieur_cavalcanti$ you #will# not be displeased i presume to listen to #one# who calls himself a very important witness and who has just presented himself
i believe that i alone of all my countrymen survived that dreadful war he is doubtless come to prove the perfect innocence of our colleague
here is a #letter# i have just received on the #subject# shall it be read or shall it be passed over
and shall we take no notice of this incident de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ turned pale and clenched his #hand# on the #paper# he held
#president# i can furnish the committee of inquiry into the conduct of the lieutenant general the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in epirus and in macedonia with important particulars
the committee decided to hear the #letter# the #count# was thoughtful and silent the #president# read mr
the #president# paused and the #count# turned pale the #president# looked at his auditors proceed was heard on all #side#
the #president# resumed i was on the #spot# at the #death# of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ i was present during his last #moment#
i know what is become of $vasiliki$ and $haydée$ i am at the command of the committee and even claim the #honor# of being heard
i shall be in the lobby when this #note# is delivered to you and who is this witness or rather this #enemy#
asked the #count# in a #tone# in which there was a visible alteration we shall know #sir# replied the #president#
is the committee willing to hear this witness yes yes they all said at once the #door# keeper was called is there #anyone# in the lobby
said the #president# yes #sir# who is it a #woman# accompanied by a #servant# #everyone# looked at his neighbor
five #minute# after the #door# keeper again appeared all #eye# were fixed on the #door# and i said $m_beauchamp$ shared the general expectation and anxiety
bring her in said the #president# behind the #door# keeper walked a #woman# enveloped in a large veil which completely concealed her
it was evident from her figure and the perfumes she had about her that she was young and fastidious in her tastes but that was all
the #president# requested her to throw aside her veil and it was then seen that she was dressed in the grecian #costume# and was remarkably beautiful
ah said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ it was she who $haydée$ who told you that alas i guess it
but go on $m_beauchamp$ you see i am calm and strong and yet we must be #drawing# near the disclosure de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ continued $m_beauchamp$
looked at this #woman# with surprise and #terror# her #lip# were about to pass his sentence of #life# or #death#
to the committee the adventure was so extraordinary and curious that the #interest# they had felt for the #count# safety became now quite a secondary #matter#
the #president# himself advanced to #place# a #seat# for the young #lady# but she declined availing herself of it as for the #count# he had fallen on his #chair# it was evident that his legs refused to support him
you have engaged to furnish the committee with some important particulars respecting the #affair# at $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and you have stated that you were an eyewitness of the #event# i was indeed said the #stranger# with a #tone# of sweet melancholy and with the sonorous #voice# peculiar to the east
but allow me to say that you must have been very young then i was four #year# old but as those #event# deeply concerned me not a single detail has escaped my memory in what #manner# could these #event# concern you
#madame# said the #president# and who are you that they should have made so deep an impression on you on them depended my #father#
#life# replied she i am $haydée$ the #daughter# of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ tepelini $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and of $vasiliki$ his beloved #wife#
the blush of mingled pride and modesty which suddenly suffused the cheeks of the young #woman# the brilliancy of her #eye# and her highly important communication produced an indescribable #effect# on the assembly
as for the #count# he could not have been more overwhelmed if a thunderbolt had fallen at his #foot# and opened an immense gulf before him
#madame# replied the #president# bowing with profound respect allow me to ask #one# #question# it shall be the last can you prove the authenticity of what you have now stated
i can #sir# said $haydée$ #drawing# from under her veil a satin satchel highly perfumed for here is the register of my birth signed by my #father# and his principal #officer# and that of my baptism my #father# having consented to my being brought up in my #mother#
faith this latter has been sealed by the grand primate of macedonia and epirus and lastly and perhaps the most important the record of the sale of my #person# and that of my #mother# to the armenian merchant el kobbir by the french #officer# who in his infamous bargain with the porte had reserved as his #part# of the booty the #wife# and #daughter# of his benefactor whom he sold for the #sum# of four hundred thousand #franc#
a greenish pallor spread over the #count# cheeks and his #eye# became bloodshot at these terrible imputations which were listened to by the assembly with ominous #silence#
$haydée$ still calm but with a calmness more dreadful than the anger of another would have been handed to the #president# the record of her sale written in arabic
it had been supposed some of the #paper# might be in the arabian romaic or turkish language and the interpreter of the $house_of_peers$ was in attendance
#one# of the noble peers who was familiar with the arabic language having studied it during the famous egyptian campaign followed with his #eye# as the translator read aloud
i el kobbir a slave merchant and purveyor of the harem of his highness acknowledge having received for transmission to the sublime emperor from the french lord the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ an emerald valued at eight hundred thousand #franc# as the ransom of a young christian slave of eleven #year# of #age# named $haydée$ the acknowledged #daughter# of the late lord $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ tepelini $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and of $vasiliki$ his favorite she having been sold to me seven #year# previously with her #mother# who had died on arriving at constantinople by a french colonel in the #service# of the vizier $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ tepelini named $m_fernand_mondego$
the above mentioned purchase was made on his highness #account# whose mandate i had for the #sum# of four hundred thousand #franc#
given at constantinople by authority of his highness in the #year# of the hegira signed el kobbir
that this record should have all due authority it shall bear the imperial seal which the vendor is bound to have affixed to it
a dreadful #silence# followed the reading of this document the #count# could only stare and his gaze fixed as if unconsciously on $haydée$ seemed #one# of #fire# and #blood#
near the merchant signature there was indeed the seal of the sublime emperor #madame# said the #president#
may reference be made to the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ who is now i believe in paris #sir# replied $haydée$
who then has counselled you to take this #step# #one# for which the #court# is deeply indebted to you and which is perfectly natural considering your birth and your #misfortune# #sir# replied $haydée$
the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ my foster #father# has been in normandy the last three #day# i have been led to take this #step# from a #feeling# of respect and #grief#
although a christian may god forgive me i have always sought to revenge my illustrious #father# since i set my #foot# in france and knew the traitor lived in paris i have watched carefully
i live retired in the $house_of_peers$ of my noble protector but i do it from choice i #love# retirement and #silence# because i can live with my #thought# and recollections of past #day#
but the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ surrounds me with every paternal #care# and i am ignorant of #nothing# which passes in the #world#
i learn all in the #silence# of my #apartment# for instance i see all the newspapers every periodical as well as every new #piece# of music and by thus watching the #course# of the #life# of #other# i learned what had transpired this #morning# in the $house_of_peers$ and what was to take #place# this #evening# then i wrote
then remarked the #president# the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ knows #nothing# of your present proceedings he is quite unaware of them and i have but
#one# #fear# which is that he should disapprove of what i have done but it is a glorious #day# for me continued the young #girl# raising her ardent gaze to heaven
that on which i find at last an opportunity of avenging my #father# the #count# had not uttered #one# #word# the whole of this #time#
his colleagues looked at him and doubtless pitied his prospects blighted under the perfumed breath of a #woman# his misery was depicted in sinister #line# on his #countenance#
do you recognize this #lady# as the #daughter# of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ tepelini $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ no said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ attempting to rise it is a base plot contrived by my #enemy#
$haydée$ whose #eye# had been fixed on the #door# as if expecting someone turned hastily and seeing the #count# standing shrieked
de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said the #president# you do not know me said she well i fortunately recognize you
you are $m_fernand_mondego$ the french #officer# who led the troops of my noble #father# it is you who surrendered the castle of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$
it is you who sent by him to constantinople to treat with the emperor for the #life# or #death# of your benefactor brought back a false mandate granting full pardon
it is you who with that mandate obtained the pasha ring which gave you authority over $selim$ the #fire# keeper it is you who stabbed $selim$
it is you who sold us my #mother# and me to the merchant el kobbir assassin assassin assassin you have still on your #brow# your #master# #blood#
these #word# had been pronounced with such enthusiasm and evident #truth# that every #eye# was fixed on the #count# #forehead# and he himself passed his #hand# across it as if he felt
#look# #gentleman# all $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ #blood# still lingering there you positively recognize de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ as the #officer# $m_fernand_mondego$ indeed
i do cried $haydée$ oh my #mother# it was you who said you were free you had a beloved #father# you were destined to be almost a queen
#look# well at that #man# it is he who raised your #father# #head# on the #point# of a spear it is he who sold us it is he who forsook us
#look# well at his #right# #hand# on which he has a large wound if you forgot his #feature# you would know him by that #hand# into which fell #one# by #one# the #gold# #piece# of the merchant el kobbir
each #word# fell like a dagger on $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and deprived him of a portion of his energy as she uttered the last he hid his mutilated #hand# hastily in his bosom and fell back on his #seat# overwhelmed by wretchedness and #despair#
i know him ah let him say now if he does not recognize me this #scene# completely changed the #opinion# of the assembly respecting the accused #count#
the #justice# of the #court# is supreme and impartial as that of god it #will# not suffer you to be trampled on by your #enemy# without giving you an opportunity of defending yourself
#count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said the #president# do not allow yourself to be cast down #answer# shall further inquiries be made
shall two members of the $house_of_peers$ be sent to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ speak $m_albert_de_morcerf$ did not reply then all the members looked at each #other# with #terror#
they knew the #count# energetic and violent temper it must be indeed a dreadful blow which would deprive him of courage to defend himself
they expected that his stupefied #silence# would be followed by a fiery outburst well asked the #president# what is your decision
i have no reply to make said the #count# in a low #tone# has the #daughter# of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ tepelini spoken the #truth#
said the #president# is she then the terrible witness to whose charge you dare not plead not guilty
have you really committed the #crime# of which you are accused the #count# looked around him with an #expression# which might have softened tigers but which could not disarm his judges
then he raised his #eye# towards the ceiling but withdrew then immediately as if he feared the roof would open and reveal to his distressed view that second tribunal called heaven and that #other# judge named god
then with a hasty movement he tore open his coat which seemed to stifle him and flew from the #room# like a madman his footstep was heard #one# #moment# in the corridor then the rattling of his #carriage# wheels as he was driven rapidly away
the #president# when #silence# was restored is the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ convicted of felony treason and conduct unbecoming a member of this $house_of_peers$ yes replied all the members of the committee of inquiry with a unanimous #voice#
she heard the #count# sentence pronounced without betraying an #expression# of #joy# or #pity# then #drawing# her veil over her #face# she bowed majestically to the councillors and left with that dignified #step# which virgil attributes to his goddesses
#gentleman# said $haydée$ had remained until the close of the meeting #chapter# the challenge then continued $m_beauchamp$
the usher who had introduced me was waiting for me at the #door# and he conducted me through the corridors to a private entrance #opening# into the rue de vaugirard
i took advantage of the #silence# and the #darkness# to leave the $house_of_peers$ without being seen i left with mingled #feeling# of sorrow and delight
excuse me $m_albert_de_morcerf$ sorrow on your #account# and delight with that noble #girl# thus pursuing paternal vengeance yes $m_albert_de_morcerf$ from whatever source the blow may have proceeded
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ held his #head# between his #hand# he raised his #face# red with shame and bathed in #tear# and seizing $m_beauchamp$ #arm#
it may be from an #enemy# but that #enemy# is only the agent of providence my #friend# said he
but i must discover who pursues me with this hatred and when i have found him i shall kill him or he #will# kill me
my #life# is ended i cannot calmly say with you providence has struck the blow i rely on your friendship to assist me $m_beauchamp$ if contempt has not banished it from your #heart#
contempt my #friend# how does this #misfortune# affect you no happily that unjust prejudice is forgotten which made the #son# responsible for the #father# actions
review your #life# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ although it is only just beginning did a lovely summer #day# ever dawn with greater purity than has marked the commencement of your career
no $m_albert_de_morcerf$ take my advice you are young and rich leave paris all is soon forgotten in this great babylon of excitement and changing tastes
you #will# #return# after three or four #year# with a russian princess for a bride and no #one# #will# think more of what occurred #yesterday# than if it had happened sixteen #year# ago
#thank# you my dear $m_beauchamp$ #thank# you for the excellent #feeling# which prompts your advice but it cannot be
you understand that interested as i am in this #affair# i cannot see it in the same #light# as you do
i have told you my #wish# or rather my determination what appears to you to emanate from a celestial source seems to me to proceed from #one# far less pure
providence appears to me to have no share in this #affair# and happily so for instead of the invisible impalpable agent of celestial rewards and punishments i shall find #one# both palpable and visible on whom i shall revenge myself i assure you for all i have suffered during the last #month#
now i repeat $m_beauchamp$ i #wish# to #return# to human and material existence and if you are still the #friend# you profess to be help me to discover the #hand# that struck the blow
if you must have me descend to #earth# i submit and if you #will# seek your #enemy# i #will# assist you and i #will# engage to find him my #honor# being almost as deeply interested as yours
be it so said $m_beauchamp$ well then you understand $m_beauchamp$ that we begin our search immediately
the calumniator is not yet punished and he may #hope# that he #will# not be but on my #honor# if he thinks so he deceives himself
each #moment# delay is an eternity for me well listen $m_albert_de_morcerf$ ah $m_beauchamp$ i see you know #something# already you #will# restore me to #life#
i do not say there is any #truth# in what i am going to tell you but it is at least a ray of #light# in a dark #night# by following it we may perhaps discover #something# more certain
tell me satisfy my impatience well i #will# tell you what i did not like to mention on my #return# from $ali_pasha_of_yanina$
say on i went of #course# to the chief #banker# of the town to make inquiries at the first #word# before i had even mentioned your #father#
#name# ah said he i guess what brings you here how and why
because a fortnight since i was questioned on the same #subject# by whom by a #banker# of paris my correspondent
whose #name# is $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ he cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$ yes it is indeed he who has so long pursued my #father# with jealous hatred
he the #man# who would be popular cannot forgive the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ for being created a peer and this #marriage# broken off without a #reason# being assigned
yes it is all from the same cause make inquiries $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but do not be angry without #reason# make inquiries and if it be true
oh yes if it be true cried the young #man# he shall pay me all i have suffered
i #will# respect his #age# as he has respected the #honor# of my #family# if my #father# had offended him why did he not attack him personally
beware $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he is already an old #man# oh no he was afraid to encounter him #face# to #face#
i do not condemn you $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i only restrain you act prudently oh do not #fear# besides you #will# accompany me
$m_beauchamp$ solemn transactions should be sanctioned by a witness before this #day# closes if $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is guilty he shall cease to live or i shall die
$pardieu$ $m_beauchamp$ mine shall be a splendid funeral when such resolutions are made $m_albert_de_morcerf$ they should be promptly executed
do you #wish# to go to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ let us go immediately they sent for a cabriolet on entering the #banker# mansion they perceived the phaeton and #servant# of $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$
ah parbleu that good said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with a gloomy #tone# if $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #will# not fight with me i #will# kill his #son# in #law# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ #will# certainly fight
the #servant# announced the young #man# but the #banker# recollecting what had transpired the #day# before did not #wish# him admitted
it was however too late $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had followed the footman and hearing the #order# given forced the #door# open and followed by $m_beauchamp$ found himself in the #banker#
#study# #sir# cried the latter am i no longer at #liberty# to receive whom i choose in my $house_of_peers$
no #sir# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ coldly there are #circumstance# in which #one# cannot except through cowardice i offer you that refuge refuse to admit certain #person# at least
i #mean# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #drawing# near and without apparently noticing $monsieur_cavalcanti$ who stood with his back towards the fireplace i #mean# to propose a meeting in some retired #corner# where no #one# #will# interrupt us for ten #minute# that #will# be sufficient where two #man# having met #one# of them #will# remain on the #ground#
you appear to forget yourself sadly what is your errand then with me #sir#
if you like $monsieur_cavalcanti$ you have a claim being almost #one# of the #family# and i #will# give as many rendezvous of that kind as i can find #person# willing to accept them
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ turned pale $monsieur_cavalcanti$ moved a #step# forward and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ turned towards him and you too said he come
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ looked at $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with a stupefied #air# and the latter making an #effort# arose and stepped between the two young #man#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ attack on $andrea_rondolo$ had placed him on a different footing and he hoped this #visit# had another cause than that he had at first supposed
indeed #sir# said he to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ if you are come to quarrel with this #gentleman# because i have preferred him to you i shall resign the #case# to the #king# attorney
i am not referring in the least to matrimony and i only addressed myself to $monsieur_cavalcanti$ because he appeared disposed to interfere between us
in #one# respect you are #right# for i am ready to quarrel with #everyone# #today# but you have the first claim $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
you mistake #sir# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with a gloomy #smile# #sir# replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ pale with anger and #fear#
when i have the #misfortune# to meet with a mad dog i kill it and far from thinking myself guilty of a #crime# i believe i do society a kindness
i warn you now if you are mad and try to bite me i #will# kill you without #pity# is it my fault that your #father# has dishonored himself
yes miserable wretch cried $m_albert_de_morcerf$ it is your fault $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ retreated a few #step# my fault
said he you must be mad what do i know of the grecian #affair# have i travelled in that #country#
no it is not you who have directly made this exposure and brought this sorrow on us but you hypocritically provoked it
did i advise your #father# to sell the castle of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ to betray #silence# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with a thundering #voice#
i yes you how came it known i suppose you read it in the #paper# in the #account# from $ali_pasha_of_yanina$
who wrote to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ yes who wrote for particulars concerning my #father#
i imagine #anyone# may write to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ but #one# #person# only wrote #one# only yes and that was you
it appears to me that when about to marry your #daughter# to a young #man# it is #right# to make some inquiries respecting his #family# it is not only a #right# but a #duty#
i assure you cried $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with a confidence and security proceeding less from #fear# than from the #interest# he really felt for the young #man#
i solemnly declare to you that i should never have #thought# of writing to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ did i know #anything# of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ #misfortune#
i doubtless wrote you wrote #sir# knowing what #answer# you would receive i indeed
who then urged you to write tell me $pardieu$ it was the most simple #thing# in the #world#
i was speaking of your #father# past history i said the origin of his #fortune# remained obscure the #person# to whom i addressed my scruples asked me where your #father# had acquired his property
i answered in greece then said he write to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and who thus advised you no #other# than your #friend# $m_de_monte_cristo$
the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ told you to write to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ yes and i wrote and #will# show you my correspondence if you like
#sir# said $m_beauchamp$ who had not yet spoken you appear to accuse the #count# who is absent from paris at this #moment# and cannot justify himself
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ and $m_beauchamp$ looked at each #other# i accuse no #one# #sir# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i relate and i #will# repeat before the #count# what i have said to you
does the #count# know what #answer# you received yes i showed it to him did he know my #father# christian #name# was $m_fernand_mondego$ and his #family# #name# $m_fernand_mondego$
yes i had told him that long since and i did only what any #other# would have done in my #circumstance# and perhaps less
when the #day# after the arrival of this #answer# your #father# came by the advice of $m_de_monte_cristo$ to ask my #daughter# #hand# for you i decidedly refused him but without any explanation or exposure
in short why should i have any more to do with the #affair# how did the #honor# or disgrace of de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ affect me
it neither increased nor decreased my income $m_albert_de_morcerf$ felt the #blood# mounting to his #brow# there was no #doubt# upon the #subject#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ defended himself with the baseness but at the same #time# with the assurance of a #man# who speaks the #truth# at least in #part# if not wholly not for conscience sake but through #fear#
it was not whether $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ or $m_de_monte_cristo$ was more or less guilty it was a #man# who would #answer# for the offence whether trifling or serious it was a #man# who would fight and it was evident $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ would not fight
$m_de_monte_cristo$ knew #everything# as he had bought the #daughter# of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and knowing #everything# he had advised $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to write to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$
the #answer# known he had yielded to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #wish# to be introduced to $haydée$ and allowed the #conversation# to #turn# on the #death# of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and had not opposed $haydée$ recital but having doubtless warned the young #girl# in the few romaic #word# he spoke to her not to implicate $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #father#
besides what was $m_albert_de_morcerf$ seeking in addition to this #everything# forgotten or unperceived before presented itself now to his recollection besides had he not begged of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ not to mention his #father# #name# before $haydée$
there could be no #doubt# that all had been calculated and previously arranged $m_de_monte_cristo$ then was in league with his #father# #enemy#
lastly he had taken $m_albert_de_morcerf$ to normandy when he knew the final blow was near $m_albert_de_morcerf$ took $m_beauchamp$ aside and communicated these #idea# to him
you are #right# said the latter $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ has only been a secondary agent in this sad #affair# and it is of de $m_de_monte_cristo$ that you must demand an explanation
#sir# said he to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ understand that i do not take a final leave of you i must ascertain if your insinuations are just and am going now to inquire of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ turned he bowed to the #banker# and went out with $m_beauchamp$ without appearing to notice $monsieur_cavalcanti$
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ accompanied him to the #door# where he again assured $m_albert_de_morcerf$ that no motive of personal hatred had influenced him against the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$
#chapter# the insult at the #banker# #door# $m_beauchamp$ stopped $m_albert_de_morcerf$ listen said he just now i told you it was of de $m_de_monte_cristo$ you must demand an explanation
yes and we are going to his $house_of_peers$ reflect $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #one# #moment# before you go on what shall i reflect
on the importance of the #step# you are taking is it more serious than going to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
yes $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is a #money# lover and those who #love# #money# you know think too much of what they risk to be easily induced to fight a duel
the #other# is on the #contrary# to all #appearance# a true nobleman but do you not #fear# to find him a bully
i only #fear# #one# #thing# namely to find a #man# who #will# not fight do not be alarmed said $m_beauchamp$
he #will# meet you my only #fear# is that he #will# be too strong for you my #friend# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with a sweet #smile# that is what i #wish#
the happiest #thing# that could occur to me would be to die in my #father# stead that would save us all
your #mother# would die of #grief# my poor #mother# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ passing his #hand# across his #eye#
i know she would but better so than die of shame are you quite decided $m_albert_de_morcerf$ yes let us go
but do you think we shall find the #count# at home he intended returning some #hour# after me and doubtless he is now at home
$m_beauchamp$ wished to go in alone but $m_albert_de_morcerf$ observed that as this was an unusual #circumstance# he might be allowed to deviate from the usual etiquette of duels
the cause which the young #man# espoused was #one# so sacred that $m_beauchamp$ had only to comply with all his #wish# he yielded and contented himself with following $m_albert_de_morcerf$
they ordered the driver to take them to no champs élysées $m_albert_de_morcerf$ sprang from the porter lodge to the #step#
he was received by $monsieur_baptistin$ the #count# had indeed just arrived but he was in his bath and had forbidden that #anyone# should be admitted
but after his bath asked $m_albert_de_morcerf$ my #master# #will# go to #dinner# and after #dinner#
he #will# sleep an #hour# then he is going to the opera are you sure of it asked $m_albert_de_morcerf$
quite #sir# my #master# has ordered his #horse# at eight clock precisely very good replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ that is all i wished to know
then turning towards $m_beauchamp$ if you have #anything# to attend to $m_beauchamp$ do it directly if you have any appointment for this #evening# defer it till #tomorrow#
i depend on you to accompany me to the opera and if you can bring $baron_de_château_renaud$ with you $m_beauchamp$ availed himself of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ permission and left him promising to call for him at a #quarter# before eight
on his #return# home $m_albert_de_morcerf$ expressed his #wish# to $m_franz_de_quesnel$ $m_lucien_debray$ and $m_maximilian_morrel$ to see them at the opera that #evening#
then he went to see his #mother# who since the #event# of the #day# before had refused to see #anyone# and had kept her #room#
he found her in #bed# overwhelmed with #grief# at this public humiliation the #sight# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ produced the #effect# which might naturally be expected on $mercédès$ she pressed her #son#
#hand# and sobbed aloud but her #tear# relieved her $m_albert_de_morcerf$ stood #one# #moment# speechless by the #side# of his #mother#
#bed# it was evident from his pale #face# and knit #brow# that his resolution to revenge himself was growing weaker
my dear #mother# said he do you know if de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ has any #enemy# $mercédès$ started she noticed that the young #man# did not say my #father#
my #son# she said #person# in the #count# situation have many #secret# #enemy# those who are known are not the most dangerous
i know it and appeal to your penetration you are of so superior a #mind# #nothing# escapes you
because for instance you noticed on the #evening# of the ball we gave that de $m_de_monte_cristo$ would eat #nothing# in our $house_of_peers$
why do you say so $mercédès$ raised herself on her feverish #arm# de $m_de_monte_cristo$ she exclaimed
you know #mother# de $m_de_monte_cristo$ is almost an oriental and it is customary with the orientals to secure full #liberty# for revenge by not eating or drinking in the #house# of their #enemy#
and how is he connected with the #question# you asked me do you say de $m_de_monte_cristo$ is our #enemy#
replied $mercédès$ becoming paler than the sheet which covered her who told you so why you are mad $m_albert_de_morcerf$
$m_de_monte_cristo$ has only shown us kindness de $m_de_monte_cristo$ saved your #life# you yourself presented him to us
oh i entreat you my #son# if you had entertained such an #idea# dispel it and my counsel to you nay my prayer is to retain his friendship
#mother# replied the young #man# you have special #reason# for telling me to conciliate that #man# i
said $mercédès$ blushing as rapidly as she had turned pale and again becoming paler than ever yes doubtless and is it not that he may never do us any harm
$mercédès$ shuddered and fixing on her #son# a scrutinizing gaze you speak strangely said she to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and you appear to have some singular prejudices
three #day# since you were with him in normandy only three #day# since we looked on him as our best #friend#
$mercédès$ saw it and with the double instinct of #woman# and #mother# guessed all but as she was prudent and strong minded she concealed both her sorrows and her #fear#
what has the #count# done an ironical #smile# passed over $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #lip# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was silent an #instant# after the #countess# resumed
you came to inquire after my health i #will# candidly acknowledge that i am not well you should install yourself here and cheer my solitude
you know how gladly i would obey your #wish# but an urgent and important #affair# obliges me to leave you for the whole #evening#
i do not #wish# to be left alone #mother# said the young #man# well replied $mercédès$ sighing go $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i #will# not make you a slave to your filial piety
scarcely had he shut her #door# when $mercédès$ called a confidential #servant# and ordered him to follow $m_albert_de_morcerf$ wherever he should go that #evening# and to come and tell her immediately what he observed
then she rang for her #lady# maid and weak as she was she dressed in #order# to be ready for whatever might happen
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ pretended he did not hear bowed to his #mother# and quitted her the footman mission was an easy #one#
at ten #minute# to eight $m_beauchamp$ arrived he had seen $baron_de_château_renaud$ who had promised to be in the orchestra before the curtain was raised
both got into $m_albert_de_morcerf$ coupé and as the young #man# had no #reason# to conceal where he was going he called aloud
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ went to his #room# and dressed with unusual #care# to the opera in his impatience he arrived before the beginning of the performance
the conduct of the #son# in seeking to avenge his #father# was so natural that $baron_de_château_renaud$ did not seek to dissuade him and was content with renewing his assurances of devotion
$baron_de_château_renaud$ was at his post apprised by $m_beauchamp$ of the #circumstance# he required no explanation from $m_albert_de_morcerf$ $m_lucien_debray$ was not yet come but $m_albert_de_morcerf$ knew that he seldom lost a #scene# at the opera
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ wandered about the theatre until the curtain was drawn up he hoped to meet with de $m_de_monte_cristo$ either in the lobby or on the stairs
but his #eye# scarcely quitted the #box# between the columns which remained obstinately closed during the whole of the first act
at last as $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was looking at his watch for about the hundredth #time# at the beginning of the second act the #door# opened and $m_de_monte_cristo$ entered dressed in black and leaning over the front of the #box# looked around the pit
$m_maximilian_morrel$ followed him and looked also for his sister and #brother# in #law# he soon discovered them in another #box# and kissed his #hand# to them
the #count# in his survey of the pit encountered a pale #face# and threatening #eye# which evidently sought to gain his #attention#
the bell summoned him to his #seat# and he entered the orchestra with $baron_de_château_renaud$ and $m_beauchamp$ he recognized $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but #thought# it better not to notice him as he looked so angry and discomposed
although apparently not noticing $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he did not however lose #sight# of him and when the curtain fell at the #end# of the second act he saw him leave the orchestra with his two #friend#
then his #head# was seen passing at the back of the #box# and the #count# knew that the approaching storm was intended to fall on him
without communicating his #thought# to his #companion# he sat down drew out his opera #glass# and looked another #way# he was at the #moment# conversing cheerfully with $m_maximilian_morrel$ but he was well prepared for what might happen
the #door# opened and $m_de_monte_cristo$ turning round saw $m_albert_de_morcerf$ pale and trembling followed by $m_beauchamp$ and $baron_de_château_renaud$ well cried he with that benevolent politeness which distinguished his salutation from the common civilities of the #world#
my cavalier has attained his object good #evening# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ the #countenance# of this #man# who possessed such extraordinary control over his #feeling# expressed the most perfect cordiality
$m_maximilian_morrel$ only then recollected the #letter# he had received from the viscount in which without assigning any #reason# he begged him to go to the opera but he understood that #something# terrible was brooding
we are not come here #sir# to exchange hypocritical #expression# of politeness or false professions of friendship said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
an explanation at the opera said the #count# with that calm #tone# and penetrating #eye# which characterize the #man# who knows his cause is good
little acquainted as i am with the habits of parisians i should not have #thought# this the #place# for such a demand
still if #people# #will# shut themselves up said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and cannot be seen because they are bathing dining or asleep we must avail ourselves of the opportunity whenever they are to be seen
i am not difficult of access #sir# for #yesterday# if my memory does not deceive me you were at my $house_of_peers$
but to demand an explanation the young #man# trembling #voice# was scarcely audible
#yesterday# i was at your $house_of_peers$ #sir# said the young #man# because then i knew not who you were
in pronouncing these #word# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had raised his #voice# so as to be heard by those in the adjoining #box# and in the lobby
thus the #attention# of many was attracted by this altercation where are you come from #sir# said $m_de_monte_cristo$
i understand your perfidy #sir# and succeed in making you understand that i #will# be revenged i shall be reasonable enough said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ furiously
you do not appear to be in the #possession# of your senses provided i do not understand you #sir# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$
and if i did your #tone# is too high i am at home here and i alone have a #right# to raise my #voice# above another
leave the #box# #sir# $m_de_monte_cristo$ pointed towards the #door# with the most commanding dignity ah i shall know how to make you leave your home
replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ clasping in his convulsed grasp the glove which $m_de_monte_cristo$ did not lose #sight# of well well said $m_de_monte_cristo$ quietly
i see you #wish# to quarrel with me but i would give you #one# #piece# of advice which you #will# do well to keep in #mind#
it is in poor taste to make a display of a challenge display is not becoming to #everyone# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$
at this #name# a murmur of #astonishment# passed around the group of spectators of this #scene# they had talked of no #one#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ understood the allusion in a #moment# and was about to throw his glove at the #count# when $m_maximilian_morrel$ seized his #hand# while $m_beauchamp$ and $baron_de_château_renaud$ fearing the #scene# would surpass the limits of a challenge held him back
but $m_de_monte_cristo$ without rising and leaning forward in his #chair# merely stretched out his #arm# and taking the damp crushed glove from the clenched #hand# of the young #man#
but $m_albert_de_morcerf$ the whole #day# #sir# said he in a solemn #tone# i consider your glove thrown and #will# #return# it to you wrapped around a bullet
now leave me or i #will# summon my #servant# to throw you out at the #door# wild almost unconscious and with #eye# inflamed $m_albert_de_morcerf$ stepped back and $m_maximilian_morrel$ closed the #door#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ took up his #glass# again as if #nothing# had happened his #face# was like marble and his #heart# was like bronze
$m_maximilian_morrel$ whispered what have you done to him i #nothing# at least personally said $m_de_monte_cristo$ but there must be some cause for this strange #scene#
the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ adventure exasperates the young #man# have you #anything# to do with it it was through $haydée$ that the #chamber# was informed of his #father#
i had been told but would not credit it that the grecian slave i have seen with you here in this very #box# was the #daughter# of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$
treason indeed said $m_maximilian_morrel$ it is true nevertheless then said $m_maximilian_morrel$ i understand it all and this #scene# was premeditated
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ wrote to request me to come to the opera doubtless that i might be a witness to the insult he meant to offer you
how so yes probably said $m_de_monte_cristo$ with his imperturbable tranquillity but what shall you do with him
with whom with $m_albert_de_morcerf$ what shall i do with $m_albert_de_morcerf$ as certainly $m_maximilian_morrel$ as i now press your #hand# i shall kill him before ten clock #tomorrow# #morning#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ in his #turn# took $m_de_monte_cristo$ #hand# in both of his and he shuddered to feel how cold and steady it was
ah #count# said he his #father# loves him so much do not speak to me of that said $m_de_monte_cristo$ with the first movement of anger he had betrayed
i #will# make him suffer $m_maximilian_morrel$ amazed let fall $m_de_monte_cristo$ #hand# #count# #count# said he dear $m_maximilian_morrel$ interrupted the #count# listen how adorably duprez is singing
that #line# mathilde idole de mon âme i was the first to discover duprez at naples and the first to applaud him
the curtain which had risen at the close of the #scene# with $m_albert_de_morcerf$ again fell and a rap was heard at the #door#
bravo bravo $m_maximilian_morrel$ saw it was useless to say more and refrained come in said $m_de_monte_cristo$ with a #voice# that betrayed not the least #emotion# and immediately $m_beauchamp$ appeared
good #evening# $m_beauchamp$ said $m_de_monte_cristo$ as if this was the first #time# he had seen the journalist that #evening#
be seated $m_beauchamp$ bowed and sitting down #sir# said he i just now accompanied de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ as you saw
and that #mean# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ laughing that you had probably just dined together i am happy to see $m_beauchamp$ that you are more sober than he was
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ was wrong i acknowledge to betray so much anger and i come on my own #account# to apologize for him
and having done so entirely on my own #account# be it understood i would add that i believe you too gentlemanly to refuse giving him some explanation concerning your connection with $ali_pasha_of_yanina$
#sir# said $m_beauchamp$ then i #will# add two #word# about the young greek #girl# $m_de_monte_cristo$ motioned him to be silent
come said he laughing there are all my #hope# about to be destroyed how so asked $m_beauchamp$
i am in your #opinion# a lara a manfred a $lord_ruthven$ then just as i am arriving at the climax you defeat your own #end# and seek to make an ordinary #man# of me
doubtless you #wish# to make me appear a very eccentric character you bring me down to your own level and demand explanations
indeed $m_beauchamp$ it is quite laughable yet replied $m_beauchamp$ haughtily there are occasions when probity commands $m_beauchamp$ interposed this strange #man#
the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ bows to none but the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ himself say no more i entreat you
i do what i please $m_beauchamp$ and it is always well done #sir# replied the young #man# honest #man# are not to be paid with such coin
i require honorable guaranties i am #sir# a living guaranty replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ motionless but with a threatening #look#
we have both #blood# in our veins which we #wish# to shed that is our mutual guaranty tell the viscount so and that #tomorrow# before ten clock i shall see what color his is
then i have only to make arrangements for the duel said $m_beauchamp$ it is quite immaterial to me said $m_de_monte_cristo$
and it was very unnecessary to disturb me at the opera for such a trifle in france #people# fight with the sword or #pistol# in the colonies with the carbine in arabia with the dagger
tell your client that although i am the insulted party in #order# to carry out my eccentricity i leave him the choice of #arm# and #will# accept without discussion without dispute #anything# even combat by #drawing# lots which is always stupid but with me different from #other# #people# as i am sure to gain
sure to gain repeated $m_beauchamp$ looking with amazement at the #count# certainly said $m_de_monte_cristo$ slightly shrugging his #shoulder#
only by a single #line# this #evening# at my $house_of_peers$ let me know the #arm# and the #hour# i do not like to be kept waiting
#pistol# then at eight clock in the bois de vincennes said $m_beauchamp$ quite disconcerted not knowing if he was dealing with an arrogant braggadocio or a supernatural being
otherwise i would not fight with de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i shall kill him i cannot help it very well #sir# said $m_de_monte_cristo$
now all that is settled do let me see the performance and tell your #friend# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ not to come any more this #evening# he #will# hurt himself with all his ill chosen barbarisms let him go home and go to sleep
$m_beauchamp$ left the #box# perfectly amazed now said $m_de_monte_cristo$ turning towards $m_maximilian_morrel$ i may depend upon you
may i not certainly said $m_maximilian_morrel$ i am at your #service# #count# still what it is desirable i should know the real
the young #man# himself is acting blindfolded and knows not the true cause which is known only to god and to me but i give you my #word# $m_maximilian_morrel$ that god who does know it #will# be on our #side#
cause that is to say you would rather not no enough said $m_maximilian_morrel$ who is your second witness
i know no #one# in paris $m_maximilian_morrel$ on whom i could confer that #honor# besides you and your #brother# $m_emmanuel$
do you think $m_emmanuel$ would oblige me i #will# #answer# for him #count# well that is all i require
#tomorrow# #morning# at seven clock you #will# be with me #will# you not we #will# hush the curtain is rising
i never lose a #note# of this opera if i can avoid it the music of william tell is so sweet
the #night# $m_de_monte_cristo$ waited according to his usual custom until duprez had sung his famous suivez moi then he rose and went out
$m_maximilian_morrel$ took leave of him at the #door# renewing his #promise# to be with him the next #morning# at seven clock and to bring $m_emmanuel$
listen #chapter# then he stepped into his coupé calm and smiling and was at home in five #minute#
no #one# who knew the #count# could mistake his #expression# when on entering he said $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ bring me my #pistol# with the ivory cross
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ brought the #box# to his #master# who examined the weapons with a solicitude very natural to a #man# who is about to intrust his #life# to a little powder and shot
these were #pistol# of an especial pattern which $m_de_monte_cristo$ had had made for target practice in his own #room#
a cap was sufficient to drive out the bullet and from the adjoining #room# no #one# would have suspected that the #count# was as sportsmen would say keeping his #hand# in
he was just taking #one# up and looking for the #point# to aim at on a little #iron# plate which served him as a target when his #study# #door# opened and $monsieur_baptistin$ entered
before he had spoken a #word# the #count# saw in the next #room# a veiled #woman# who had followed closely after $monsieur_baptistin$ and now seeing the #count# with a #pistol# in his #hand# and swords on the #table# rushed in
$monsieur_baptistin$ looked at his #master# who made a #sign# to him and he went out closing the #door# after him
the #stranger# cast #one# #look# around her to be certain that they were quite alone then bending as if she would have knelt and joining her #hand# she said with an accent of #despair#
who are you #madame# said the #count# to the veiled #woman# $edmond_dantès$ you #will# not kill my #son# the #count# retreated a #step# uttered a slight exclamation and let fall the #pistol# he held
what #name# did you pronounce then #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said he yours cried she throwing back her veil yours which i alone perhaps have not forgotten
$edmond_dantès$ it is not #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who is come to you it is $mercédès$ mercédès is dead #madame# said $m_de_monte_cristo$
$mercédès$ #life# #sir# and she remembers for she alone recognized you when she saw you and even before she saw you by your #voice# $edmond_dantès$ by the simple #sound# of your #voice# and from that #moment# she has followed your #step# watched you feared you and she needs not to inquire what #hand# has dealt the blow which now strikes de $m_albert_de_morcerf$
i know no #one# now of that #name# $m_fernand_mondego$ do you #mean# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ with bitter irony
$m_de_monte_cristo$ had pronounced the #name# of $m_fernand_mondego$ with such an #expression# of hatred that $mercédès$ felt a thrill of horror run through every vein
since we are recalling #name# let us remember them all you see $edmond_dantès$ i am not mistaken and have cause to say spare my #son#
and who told you #madame# that i have any hostile intentions against your #son# no #one# in #truth# but a #mother# has twofold #sight#
i guessed all i followed him this #evening# to the opera and concealed in a parquet #box# have seen all
if you have seen all #madame# you know that the #son# of $m_fernand_mondego$ has publicly insulted me said $m_de_monte_cristo$ with awful calmness
you have seen that he would have thrown his glove in my #face# if $m_maximilian_morrel$ #one# of my #friend# had not stopped him
oh for #pity# sake listen to me my #son# has also guessed who you are he attributes his #father# #misfortune# to you
#madame# you are mistaken they are not #misfortune# it is a punishment it is not i who strike de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ it is providence which punishes him
and why do you represent providence cried $mercédès$ why do you remember when it forgets what are $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and its vizier to you $edmond_dantès$
what injury has $m_fernand_mondego$ done you in betraying $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ tepelini ah #madame# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ all this is an #affair# between the french #captain# and the #daughter# of $vasiliki$
it does not concern me you are #right# and if i have sworn to revenge myself it is not on the french #captain# or the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but on the fisherman $m_fernand_mondego$ the #husband# of $mercédès$ the catalane
i am the only culprit $edmond_dantès$ and if you owe revenge to #anyone# it is to me who had not fortitude to bear your absence and my solitude
ah #sir# cried the #countess# how terrible a vengeance for a fault which fatality made me commit for
but exclaimed $m_de_monte_cristo$ why was i absent and why were you alone because you had been arrested $edmond_dantès$ and were a #prisoner#
and why was i arrested why was i a #prisoner# i do not know said $mercédès$
i was arrested and became a #prisoner# because under the arbor of la réserve the #day# before i was to marry you a #man# named $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ wrote this #letter# which the fisherman $m_fernand_mondego$ himself posted
$m_de_monte_cristo$ went to a secretaire opened a drawer by a spring from which he took a #paper# which had lost its original color and the ink of which had become of a rusty hue
you do not #madame# at least i #hope# not but i #will# tell you this he placed in the #hand# of $mercédès$
it was $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #letter# to the #king# attorney which the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ disguised as a clerk from the $house_of_peers$ of $thomson_french_of_rome$ had taken from the file against $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ on the #day# he had paid the two hundred thousand #franc# to $m_de_boville$
the #king# attorney is informed by a #friend# to the throne and religion that #one# $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ second in command on #board# the $pharaon$ this #day# arrived from smyrna after having touched at naples and porto ferrajo is the bearer of a #letter# from murat to the usurper and of another #letter# from the usurper to the bonapartist club in paris
ample corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the above mentioned $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ who either carries the #letter# for paris about with him or has it at his #father#
should it not be found in #possession# of either #father# or #son# then it #will# assuredly be discovered in the cabin belonging to the said $m_dantès$ on #board# the $pharaon$
$mercédès$ read with #terror# the following #line# abode how dreadful said $mercédès$ passing her #hand# across her #brow# moist with perspiration
and that #letter# i bought it for two hundred thousand #franc# #madame# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ but that is a trifle since it enables me to justify myself to you
and the result of that #letter# you well know #madame# was my arrest but you do not know how long that arrest lasted
you do not know that i remained for fourteen #year# within a #quarter# of a league of you in a dungeon in the château if
you do not know that every #day# of those fourteen #year# i renewed the vow of vengeance which i had made the first #day# and yet i was not aware that you had married $m_fernand_mondego$ my calumniator and that my #father# had died of hunger
that is what i heard on leaving my #prison# fourteen #year# after i had entered it and that is why on #account# of the living $mercédès$ and my deceased #father# i have sworn to revenge myself on $m_fernand_mondego$ and
can it be cried $mercédès$ shuddering i have revenged myself and you are sure the unhappy $m_fernand_mondego$ did that
i am satisfied #madame# that he did what i have told you besides that is not much more odious than that a frenchman by adoption should pass over to the english that a spaniard by birth should have fought against the spaniards that a stipendiary of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ should have betrayed and murdered $ali_pasha_of_yanina$
compared with such #thing# what is the #letter# you have just read a lover deception which the #woman# who has married that #man# ought certainly to forgive but not so the lover who was to have married her
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ in his tomb left the traitor unpunished but i betrayed sacrificed buried have risen from my tomb by the grace of god to punish that #man#
well the french did not avenge themselves on the traitor the spaniards did not shoot the traitor he sends me for that #purpose# and here i am
the poor #woman# #head# and #arm# fell her legs bent under her and she fell on her knees forgive $edmond_dantès$ forgive for my sake who #love# you still
the dignity of the #wife# checked the fervor of the lover and the #mother# her #forehead# almost touched the carpet when the #count# sprang forward and raised her
then seated on a #chair# she looked at the manly #countenance# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ on which #grief# and hatred still impressed a threatening #expression#
not crush that accursed race murmured he abandon my #purpose# at the #moment# of its accomplishment impossible #madame# impossible $edmond_dantès$ said the poor #mother# who tried every #mean#
well yes you are #right# that #name# has still its charms and this is the first #time# for a long period that i have pronounced it so distinctly
oh $mercédès$ i have uttered your #name# with the sigh of melancholy with the groan of sorrow with the last #effort# of #despair# i have uttered it when frozen with cold crouched on the straw in my dungeon i have uttered it consumed with heat rolling on the #stone# #floor# of my #prison#
$mercédès$ i must revenge myself for i suffered fourteen #year# fourteen #year# i wept i cursed now i tell you $mercédès$ i must revenge myself
the #count# fearing to yield to the entreaties of her he had so ardently loved called his sufferings to the assistance of his hatred
when i call you $edmond_dantès$ why do you not call me $mercédès$ mercédès repeated $m_de_monte_cristo$ $mercédès$ revenge yourself then $edmond_dantès$ cried the poor #mother#
it is written in the good book said $m_de_monte_cristo$ that the sins of the #father# shall fall upon their #child# to the third and fourth generation
but let your vengeance fall on the culprits on him on me but not on my #son# since god himself dictated those #word# to his prophet why should i seek to make myself better than god
$edmond_dantès$ continued $mercédès$ with her #arm# extended towards the #count# since i first knew you i have adored your #name# have respected your memory
$edmond_dantès$ my #friend# do not compel me to tarnish that noble and pure image reflected incessantly on the mirror of my #heart#
$edmond_dantès$ if you knew all the prayers i have addressed to god for you while i #thought# you were living and since i have #thought# you must be dead
i imagined your dead #body# buried at the #foot# of some gloomy tower or cast to the bottom of a pit by hateful #jailer# and i wept
yes dead alas what could i do for you $edmond_dantès$ besides pray and weep listen for ten #year# i dreamed each #night# the same #dream#
i had been told that you had endeavored to escape that you had taken the #place# of another #prisoner# that you had slipped into the winding sheet of a dead #body# that you had been thrown alive from the top of the château if and that the #cry# you uttered as you dashed upon the #rock# first revealed to your #jailer# that they were your murderers
well $edmond_dantès$ i swear to you by the #head# of that #son# for whom i entreat your #pity# $edmond_dantès$ for ten #year# i saw every #night# every detail of that frightful tragedy and for ten #year# i heard every #night# the #cry# which awoke me shuddering and cold
and i too $edmond_dantès$ oh believe me guilty as i was oh yes i too have suffered much have you known what it is to have your #father# starve to #death# in your absence
cried $m_de_monte_cristo$ thrusting his #hand# into his #hair# have you seen the #woman# you loved giving her #hand# to your rival while you were perishing at the bottom of a dungeon
no interrupted $mercédès$ but i have seen him whom i loved on the #point# of murdering my #son#
$mercédès$ uttered these #word# with such deep anguish with an accent of such intense #despair# that $m_de_monte_cristo$ could not restrain a sob
the lion was daunted the avenger was conquered what do you ask of me said he your #son# #life# well he shall live
$mercédès$ uttered a #cry# which made the #tear# start from $m_de_monte_cristo$ #eye# but these #tear# disappeared almost instantaneously for doubtless god had sent some angel to collect them
far more precious were they in his #eye# than the richest pearls of guzerat and ophir oh said she seizing the #count# #hand# and raising it to her #lip#
oh #thank# you #thank# you $edmond_dantès$ now you are exactly what i dreamt you were the #man# i always loved oh now i may say so
so much the better replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ as that poor $edmond_dantès$ #will# not have long to be loved by you
#death# is about to #return# to the tomb the phantom to retire in #darkness# what do you say $edmond_dantès$
i say since you command me $mercédès$ i must die die and why so who talks of dying whence have you these #idea# of #death#
you do not suppose that publicly outraged in the #face# of a whole theatre in the #presence# of your #friend# and those of your #son# challenged by a #boy# who #will# glory in my forgiveness as if it were a victory
what i most loved after you $mercédès$ was myself my dignity and that #strength# which rendered me superior to #other# #man# that #strength# was my #life#
you do not suppose that i can for #one# #moment# #wish# to live with #one# #word# you have crushed it and i die
but the duel #will# not take #place# $edmond_dantès$ since you forgive it #will# take #place# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ in a most solemn #tone#
but instead of your #son# #blood# to stain the #ground# mine #will# flow $mercédès$ shrieked and sprang towards $m_de_monte_cristo$ but suddenly stopping
$edmond_dantès$ said she there is a god above us since you live and since i have seen you again i trust to him from my #heart#
while waiting his assistance i trust to your #word# you have said that my #son# should live have you not
yes #madame# he shall live said $m_de_monte_cristo$ surprised that without more #emotion# $mercédès$ had accepted the heroic sacrifice he made for her
$edmond_dantès$ said she and her #eye# were wet with #tear# while looking at him to whom she spoke how noble it is of you
how great the action you have just performed how sublime to have taken #pity# on a poor #woman# who appealed to you with every #chance# against her alas i am grown old with #grief# more than with #year# and cannot now remind my $edmond_dantès$ by a #smile# or by a #look# of that $mercédès$ whom he once spent so many #hour# in contemplating
ah believe me $edmond_dantès$ as i told you i too have suffered much i repeat it is melancholy to pass #one# #life# without having #one# #joy# to recall without preserving a single #hope# but that proves that all is not yet over
$mercédès$ extended her #hand# to the #count# no it is not finished i feel it by what remains in my #heart#
do you say so now $mercédès$ then what would you say if you knew the extent of the sacrifice i make to you
suppose that the supreme being after having created the #world# and fertilized chaos had paused in the #work# to spare an angel the #tear# that might #one# #day# flow for mortal sins from her immortal #eye# suppose that when #everything# was in readiness and the #moment# had come for god to #look# upon his #work# and see that it was good
oh i repeat it $edmond_dantès$ what you have just done is beautiful it is grand it is sublime suppose he had snuffed out the sun and tossed the #world# back into eternal #night# then
$mercédès$ looked at the #count# in a #way# which expressed at the same #time# her #astonishment# her admiration and her gratitude
$m_de_monte_cristo$ pressed his #forehead# on his burning #hand# as if his brain could no longer bear alone the weight of its #thought#
even then $mercédès$ you could not imagine what i lose in sacrificing my #life# at this #moment# $edmond_dantès$ said $mercédès$
you #will# see that if my #face# is pale if my #eye# are dull if my beauty is gone if $mercédès$ in short no longer resembles her former self in her #feature# you #will# see that her #heart# is still the same
i have but #one# #word# more to say to you the #count# smiled bitterly $edmond_dantès$ continued she adieu then $edmond_dantès$ i have #nothing# more to ask of heaven
i have seen you again and have found you as noble and as great as formerly you were adieu $edmond_dantès$ adieu and #thank# you
$mercédès$ opened the #door# of the #study# and had disappeared before he had recovered from the painful and profound reverie into which his thwarted vengeance had plunged him
the clock of the invalides struck #one# when the #carriage# which conveyed #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ rolled away on the pavement of the champs élysées and made $m_de_monte_cristo$ raise his #head#
what a fool i was said he not to #tear# my #heart# out on the #day# when i resolved to avenge myself
but the #count# did not #answer# #chapter# the meeting after $mercédès$ had left $m_de_monte_cristo$ he fell into profound gloom
around him and within him the flight of #thought# seemed to have stopped his energetic #mind# slumbered as the #body# does after extreme fatigue
what said he to himself while the lamp and the wax #light# were nearly burnt out and the #servant# were waiting impatiently in the anteroom
this edifice which i have been so long preparing which i have reared with so much #care# and toil is to be crushed by a single touch a #word# a breath
yes this self of whom i #thought# so much of whom i was so proud who had appeared so worthless in the dungeons of the château if and whom i had succeeded in making so great #will# be but a lump of clay #tomorrow#
alas it is not the #death# of the #body# i regret for is not the destruction of the vital principle the repose to which #everything# is tending to which every unhappy being aspires is not this the repose of #matter# after which i so long sighed and which i was seeking to attain by the painful process of starvation when $abbé_faria$ appeared in my dungeon
no it is not existence then that i regret but the ruin of projects so slowly carried out so laboriously framed
what what is #death# for me #one# #step# farther into #rest# two perhaps into #silence# providence is now opposed to them when i most #thought# it would be propitious
this burden almost as heavy as a #world# which i had raised and i had #thought# to bear to the #end# was too great for my #strength# and i was compelled to lay it down in the middle of my career
oh shall i then again become a fatalist whom fourteen #year# of #despair# and ten of #hope# had rendered a believer in providence
and all this all this because my #heart# which i #thought# dead was only sleeping because it has awakened and has begun to beat again because i have yielded to the pain of the #emotion# excited in my breast by a #woman# #voice#
yet continued the #count# becoming each #moment# more absorbed in the anticipation of the dreadful sacrifice for the morrow which $mercédès$ had accepted yet
it is impossible that so noble minded a #woman# should thus through selfishness consent to my #death# when i am in the prime of #life# and #strength# it is impossible that she can carry to such a #point# maternal #love# or rather delirium
no she must have conceived some pathetic #scene# she #will# come and throw herself between us and what would be sublime here #will# there appear ridiculous
it is not god #will# that they should be accomplished there are virtues which become #crime# by exaggeration
the blush of pride mounted to the #count# #forehead# as this #thought# passed through his #mind# ridiculous repeated he
by thus exaggerating to his own #mind# the anticipated ill #fortune# of the next #day# to which he had condemned himself by promising $mercédès$ to spare her #son# the #count# at last exclaimed folly folly folly to carry generosity so far as to put myself up as a mark for that young #man# to aim at
he #will# never believe that my #death# was suicide and yet it is important for the #honor# of my memory and this surely is not vanity but a justifiable pride it is important the #world# should know that i have consented by my free #will# to stop my #arm# already raised to strike and that with the #arm# which has been so powerful against #other# i have struck myself
and the ridicule #will# fall on me i ridiculous no i would rather die it must be it shall be
seizing a pen he drew a #paper# from a #secret# drawer in his desk and wrote at the bottom of the document which was no #other# than his #will# made since his arrival in paris a #sort# of codicil clearly explaining the #nature# of his #death#
i do this oh my god said he with his #eye# raised to heaven as much for thy #honor# as for mine
during ten #year# considered myself the agent of thy vengeance and #other# wretches like $m_albert_de_morcerf$ $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ even $m_albert_de_morcerf$ himself must not imagine that #chance# has freed them from their #enemy#
let them know on the #contrary# that their punishment which had been decreed by providence is only delayed by my present determination and although they escape it in this #world# it awaits them in another and that they are only exchanging #time# for eternity
while he was thus agitated by gloomy uncertainties wretched waking #dream# of #grief# the first rays of #morning# pierced his #window# and shone upon the pale blue #paper# on which he had just inscribed his justification of providence
i have it was just five clock in the #morning# when a slight #noise# like a stifled sigh reached his ear
he turned his #head# looked around him and saw no #one# but the #sound# was repeated distinctly enough to convince him of its reality
he arose and quietly #opening# the #door# of the #drawing# #room# saw $haydée$ who had fallen on a #chair# with her #arm# hanging down and her beautiful #head# thrown back
she had been standing at the #door# to prevent his going out without seeing her until sleep which the young cannot resist had overpowered her frame wearied as she was with watching
the #noise# of the #door# did not awaken her and $m_de_monte_cristo$ gazed at her with affectionate regret she remembered that she had a #son# said he
and i forgot i had a #daughter# then shaking his #head# sorrowfully poor $haydée$ said he she wished to see me to speak to me she has feared or guessed #something#
oh i cannot go without taking leave of her i cannot die without confiding her to someone he quietly regained his #seat# and wrote under the #other# #line#
i bequeath to $m_maximilian_morrel$ #captain# of spahis and #son# of my former patron pierre $m_maximilian_morrel$ shipowner at marseilles the #sum# of twenty #million# a #part# of which may be offered to his sister $mademoiselle_julie$ and #brother# in #law# $m_emmanuel$ if he does not #fear# this increase of #fortune# may mar their #happiness#
if his #heart# is free and he #will# marry $haydée$ the #daughter# of $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ whom i have brought up with the #love# of a #father# and who has shown the #love# and tenderness of a #daughter# for me he #will# thus accomplish my last #wish#
this #will# has already constituted $haydée$ heiress of the #rest# of my #fortune# consisting of lands funds in england austria and holland furniture in my different palaces and #house# and which without the twenty #million# and the legacies to my #servant# may still amount to sixty #million#
he was finishing the last #line# when a #cry# behind him made him start and the pen fell from his #hand#
these twenty #million# are concealed in my grotto at $m_de_monte_cristo$ of which $m_bertuccio$ knows the #secret# $haydée$ said he did you read it
oh my lord said she why are you writing thus at such an #hour# why are you bequeathing all your #fortune# to me
are you going to leave me i am going on a journey dear #child# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ with an #expression# of infinite tenderness and melancholy
and if any #misfortune# should happen to me the #count# stopped well asked the young #girl# with an authoritative #tone# the #count# had never observed before and which startled him
well if any #misfortune# happen to me replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ i #wish# my #daughter# to be happy $haydée$ smiled sorrowfully and shook her #head#
do you think of dying my lord said she the wise #man# my #child# has said it is good to think of #death#
bequeath your #fortune# to #other# for if you die i shall require #nothing# and taking the #paper# she tore it in four #piece# and threw it into the middle of the #room#
well if you die said she then the #effort# having exhausted her #strength# she fell not asleep this #time# but fainting on the #floor#
the #count# leaned over her and raised her in his #arm# and seeing that sweet pale #face# those lovely #eye# closed that beautiful form motionless and to all #appearance# lifeless the #idea# occurred to him for the first #time# that perhaps she loved him otherwise than as a #daughter# loves a #father#
then he carried $haydée$ to her #room# resigned her to the #care# of her attendants and returning to his #study# which he shut quickly this #time# he again copied the destroyed #will#
alas murmured he with intense suffering i might then have been happy yet as he was finishing the #sound# of a cabriolet entering the yard was heard
$m_de_monte_cristo$ approached the #window# and saw $m_maximilian_morrel$ and $m_emmanuel$ alight good said he it was #time# and he sealed his #will# with three seals
a #moment# afterwards he heard a #noise# in the #drawing# #room# and went to open the #door# himself $m_maximilian_morrel$ was there he had come twenty #minute# before the #time# appointed
i am perhaps come too soon #count# said he but i frankly acknowledge that i have not closed my #eye# all #night# nor has #anyone# in my $house_of_peers$
$m_de_monte_cristo$ could not resist this #proof# of affection he not only extended his #hand# to the young #man# but flew to him with open #arm#
i need to see you strong in your courageous assurance to recover myself $m_maximilian_morrel$ said he it is a happy #day# for me to feel that i am beloved by such a #man# as you
good #morning# $m_emmanuel$ you #will# come with me then $m_maximilian_morrel$ did you #doubt# it said the young #captain# but if i were wrong
i watched you during the whole #scene# of that challenge #yesterday# i have been thinking of your firmness all #night# and i said to myself that #justice# must be on your #side# or #man# #countenance# is no longer to be relied on
but $m_maximilian_morrel$ $m_albert_de_morcerf$ is your #friend# simply an acquaintance #sir# you met on the same #day# you first saw me
yes that is true but i should not have recollected it if you had not reminded me #thank# you $m_maximilian_morrel$
then ringing the bell once #look# said he to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ who came immediately take that to my solicitor
it is my #will# $m_maximilian_morrel$ when i am dead you #will# go and examine it what said $m_maximilian_morrel$
you dead yes must i not be prepared for #everything# dear #friend# but what did you do #yesterday# after you left me
i went to tortoni where as i expected i found $m_beauchamp$ and $baron_de_château_renaud$ i own i was seeking them
why when all was arranged listen #count# the #affair# is serious and unavoidable did you #doubt# it
no the offence was public and #everyone# is already talking of it well well i hoped to get an exchange of #arm# to substitute the sword for the #pistol# the #pistol# is blind
have you succeeded asked $m_de_monte_cristo$ quickly with an imperceptible gleam of #hope# no for your skill with the sword is so well known
ah who has betrayed me the skilful swordsman whom you have conquered and you failed they positively refused
$m_maximilian_morrel$ said the #count# have you ever seen me #fire# a #pistol# never well we have #time# #look#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ took the #pistol# he held in his #hand# when $mercédès$ entered and fixing an ace of clubs against the #iron# plate with four shots he successively shot off the four #side# of the club
he examined the bullets with which $m_de_monte_cristo$ performed this dexterous feat and saw that they were no larger than buckshot
at each shot $m_maximilian_morrel$ turned pale it is astonishing said he #look# $m_emmanuel$ then turning towards $m_de_monte_cristo$
#count# said he in the #name# of all that is dear to you i entreat you not to kill $m_albert_de_morcerf$ the unhappy youth
has a #mother# you are #right# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ and i have none these #word# were uttered in a #tone# which made $m_maximilian_morrel$ shudder
you are the offended party #count# doubtless what does that imply that you #will# #fire# first
i #fire# first oh i obtained or rather claimed that we had conceded enough for them to yield us that
and at what #distance# twenty paces a #smile# of terrible import passed over the #count# #lip#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ said he do not forget what you have just seen the only #chance# for $m_albert_de_morcerf$ safety then #will# arise from your #emotion#
or from your generosity my #friend# to so good a marksman as you are i may say what would appear absurd to another
i suffer from #emotion# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ what is that break his #arm# wound him but do not kill him
i #will# tell you $m_maximilian_morrel$ said the #count# that i do not need entreating to spare the #life# of de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he shall be so well spared that he #will# #return# quietly with his two #friend# while i
and you that #will# be another #thing# i shall be brought home no no cried $m_maximilian_morrel$ quite unable to restrain his #feeling#
as i told you my dear $m_maximilian_morrel$ de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #will# kill me $m_maximilian_morrel$ looked at him in utter amazement
but what has happened then since last #evening# #count# the same #thing# that happened to brutus the #night# before the battle of philippi i have seen a ghost
and that ghost told me $m_maximilian_morrel$ that i had lived long enough $m_maximilian_morrel$ and $m_emmanuel$ looked at each #other#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ drew out his watch let us go said he it is five #minute# past seven and the appointment was for eight clock
he had stopped a #moment# in the passage to listen at a #door# and $m_maximilian_morrel$ and $m_emmanuel$ who had considerately passed forward a few #step# #thought# they heard him #answer# by a sigh to a sob from within
a #carriage# was in readiness at the #door# $m_de_monte_cristo$ stepped into it with his two #friend# as the clock struck eight they drove up to the #place# of meeting
we are first said $m_maximilian_morrel$ looking out of the #window# excuse me #sir# said $monsieur_baptistin$ who had followed his #master# with indescribable #terror#
but i think i see a #carriage# down there under the #tree# $m_de_monte_cristo$ sprang lightly from the #carriage# and offered his #hand# to assist $m_emmanuel$ and $m_maximilian_morrel$
the latter retained the #count# #hand# between his i like said he to feel a #hand# like this when its owner relies on the goodness of his cause
it seems to me said $m_emmanuel$ that i see two young #man# down there who are evidently waiting
$m_de_monte_cristo$ drew $m_maximilian_morrel$ a #step# or two behind his #brother# in #law# $m_maximilian_morrel$ said he are your affections disengaged $m_maximilian_morrel$ looked at $m_de_monte_cristo$ with #astonishment#
i do not seek your confidence my dear #friend# i only ask you a simple #question# #answer# it that is all i require
i #love# a young #girl# #count# do you #love# her much more than my #life#
to tell the #truth# #count# if i knew less of you i should think that you were less brave than you are
another #hope# defeated said the #count# then with a sigh poor $haydée$ murmured he because i sigh when thinking of someone i am leaving
come $m_maximilian_morrel$ it is not like a #soldier# to be so bad a judge of courage do i regret #life# what is it to me who have passed twenty #year# between #life# and #death#
i know the #world# is a #drawing# #room# from which we must retire politely and honestly that is with a bow and our debts of #honor# paid
moreover do not alarm yourself $m_maximilian_morrel$ this weakness if it is such is betrayed to you alone that is to the #purpose#
have you brought your #arm# i what for i #hope# these #gentleman# have theirs i #will# inquire said $m_maximilian_morrel$
do but make no treaty you understand me you need not #fear# $m_maximilian_morrel$ advanced towards $m_beauchamp$ and $baron_de_château_renaud$ who seeing his intention came to meet him
the three young #man# bowed to each #other# courteously if not affably excuse me #gentleman# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ but i do not see de $m_albert_de_morcerf$
he sent us #word# this #morning# replied $baron_de_château_renaud$ that he would meet us on the #ground# ah said $m_maximilian_morrel$
$m_beauchamp$ pulled out his watch it is only five #minute# past eight said he to $m_maximilian_morrel$ there is not much #time# lost yet
oh i made no allusion of that kind replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ there is a #carriage# coming said $baron_de_château_renaud$ it advanced rapidly along #one# of the avenues leading towards the open space where they were assembled
you are doubtless provided with #pistol# #gentleman# de $m_de_monte_cristo$ yields his #right# of using his we had anticipated this kindness on the #part# of the #count# said $m_beauchamp$
and i have brought some weapons which i bought eight or ten #day# since thinking to want them on a similar occasion
oh $m_beauchamp$ if you assure me that de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ does not know these #pistol# you may readily believe that your #word# #will# be quite sufficient
they are quite new and have not yet been used #will# you examine them #gentleman# said $baron_de_château_renaud$
it is not $m_albert_de_morcerf$ coming in that #carriage# faith it is $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and $m_lucien_debray$ the two young #man# he announced were indeed approaching
what #chance# brings you here #gentleman# said $baron_de_château_renaud$ shaking #hand# with each of them because said $m_lucien_debray$ $m_albert_de_morcerf$ sent this #morning# to request us to come
$m_beauchamp$ and $baron_de_château_renaud$ exchanged #look# of #astonishment# i think i understand his #reason# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ what is it
#yesterday# afternoon i received a #letter# from de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ begging me to attend the opera and i said $m_lucien_debray$
and i also said $m_franz_de_quesnel$ and we too added $m_beauchamp$ and $baron_de_château_renaud$ having wished you all to witness the challenge he now #wish# you to be present at the combat
exactly so said the young #man# you have probably guessed #right# but after all these arrangements he does not come himself said $baron_de_château_renaud$
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ is ten #minute# after #time# there he comes said $m_beauchamp$ on horseback at full gallop followed by a #servant#
how imprudent said $baron_de_château_renaud$ to come on horseback to fight a duel with #pistol# after all the instructions i had given him
and besides said $m_beauchamp$ with a collar above his cravat an open coat and white waistcoat why has he not painted a #spot# upon his #heart# it would have been more simple
meanwhile $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had arrived within ten paces of the group formed by the five young #man# he jumped from his #horse# threw the bridle on his #servant# #arm# and joined them
he was pale and his #eye# were red and swollen it was evident that he had not slept a shade of melancholy gravity overspread his #countenance# which was not natural to him
i #thank# you #gentleman# said he for having complied with my request i feel extremely grateful for this mark of friendship
$m_maximilian_morrel$ had stepped back as $m_albert_de_morcerf$ approached and remained at a short #distance# and to you also $m_maximilian_morrel$ my #thank# are due
come there cannot be too many #sir# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ you are not perhaps aware that i am de $m_de_monte_cristo$ #friend#
i was not sure but i #thought# it might be so so much the better the more honorable #man# there are here the better i shall be satisfied
$m_maximilian_morrel$ said $baron_de_château_renaud$ #will# you apprise the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ that de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ is arrived and we are at his disposal
$m_maximilian_morrel$ was preparing to fulfil his commission $m_beauchamp$ had meanwhile drawn the #box# of #pistol# from the #carriage#
stop #gentleman# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i have two #word# to say to the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ in private asked $m_maximilian_morrel$
$m_franz_de_quesnel$ and $m_lucien_debray$ exchanged some #word# in a whisper and $m_maximilian_morrel$ rejoiced at this unexpected incident went to fetch the #count# who was walking in a retired path with $m_emmanuel$
no #sir# before all who are here $m_albert_de_morcerf$ witnesses looked at each #other# what does he want with me said $m_de_monte_cristo$
i do not know but he #wish# to speak to you ah said $m_de_monte_cristo$ i trust he is not going to tempt me by some fresh insult
i do not think that such is his intention said $m_maximilian_morrel$ the #count# advanced accompanied by $m_maximilian_morrel$ and $m_emmanuel$
his calm and serene #look# formed a singular contrast to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #grief# stricken #face# who approached also followed by the #other# four young #man#
i #wish# you not to lose #one# #word# of what i am about to have the #honor# of saying to the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ for it must be repeated by you to all who #will# listen to it strange as it may appear to you
when at three paces distant from each #other# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and the #count# stopped approach #gentleman# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ proceed #sir# said the #count#
i reproached you with exposing the conduct of de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in epirus for guilty as i knew he was i #thought# you had no #right# to punish him but i have since learned that you had that #right#
it is not $m_fernand_mondego$ treachery towards $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ which induces me so readily to excuse you but the treachery of the fisherman $m_fernand_mondego$ towards you and the almost unheard of miseries which were its consequences and i say and proclaim it publicly that you were justified in revenging yourself on my #father# and i his #son# #thank# you for not using greater severity
had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of the spectators of this unexpected #scene# it would not have surprised them more than did $m_albert_de_morcerf$ declaration
#sir# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ at first with a tremulous #voice# but which gradually became firmer as for $m_de_monte_cristo$ his #eye# slowly rose towards heaven with an #expression# of infinite gratitude
he could not understand how $m_albert_de_morcerf$ fiery #nature# of which he had seen so much among the roman #bandit# had suddenly stooped to this humiliation
he recognized the influence of $mercédès$ and saw why her noble #heart# had not opposed the sacrifice she knew beforehand would be useless
now #sir# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ if you think my apology sufficient pray give me your #hand# next to the merit of infallibility which you appear to possess i rank that of candidly acknowledging a fault
an angel alone could have saved #one# of us from #death# that angel came from heaven if not to make us #friend# which alas fatality renders impossible at least to make us esteem each #other#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ with moistened #eye# heaving breast and #lip# #half# open extended to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ a #hand# which the latter pressed with a sentiment resembling respectful #fear#
but this confession concerns me only i acted well as a #man# but you have acted better than #man#
#gentleman# said he de $m_de_monte_cristo$ receives my apology i had acted hastily towards him hasty actions are generally bad #one#
but if #anyone# should entertain a false #opinion# of me added he #drawing# himself up as if he would challenge both #friend# and #enemy# i shall endeavor to correct his mistake
now my fault is repaired i #hope# the #world# #will# not call me cowardly for acting as my conscience dictated
what happened during the #night# asked $m_beauchamp$ of $baron_de_château_renaud$ we appear to make a very sorry figure here
in #truth# what $m_albert_de_morcerf$ has just done is either very despicable or very noble replied the #baron# what can it #mean# said $m_lucien_debray$ to $m_franz_de_quesnel$
the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ acts dishonorably to de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and is justified by his #son# had i ten yaninas in my #family#
i should only consider myself the more bound to fight ten #time# as for $m_de_monte_cristo$ his #head# was bent down his #arm# were powerless
bowing under the weight of twenty four #year# reminiscences he #thought# not of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ of $m_beauchamp$ of $baron_de_château_renaud$ or of any of that group but he #thought# of that courageous #woman# who had come to plead for her #son# #life# to whom he had offered his and who had now saved it by the revelation of a dreadful #family# #secret# capable of destroying forever in that young #man#
#heart# every #feeling# of filial piety providence still murmured he now only am i fully convinced of being the emissary of god
#mother# and #son# the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ bowed to the five young #man# with a melancholy and dignified #smile# and got into his #carriage# with $m_maximilian_morrel$ and $m_emmanuel$
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ looked at his two #friend# not timidly but in a #way# that appeared to ask their #opinion# of what he had just done
indeed my dear #friend# said $m_beauchamp$ first who had either the most #feeling# or the least dissimulation allow me to congratulate you this is a very unhoped for conclusion of a very disagreeable #affair#
#chapter# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ $m_beauchamp$ and $baron_de_château_renaud$ remained alone $m_albert_de_morcerf$ remained silent and wrapped in #thought# $baron_de_château_renaud$ contented himself with tapping his boot with his flexible cane
when you please replied $m_beauchamp$ allow me only to compliment de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who has given #proof# #today# of rare chivalric generosity
are we not going said he after this embarrassing #silence# oh yes said $baron_de_château_renaud$ it is magnificent continued $m_beauchamp$ to be able to exercise so much self control
assuredly as for me i should have been incapable of it said $baron_de_château_renaud$ with most significant coolness #gentleman# interrupted $m_albert_de_morcerf$
i think you did not understand that #something# very serious had passed between de $m_de_monte_cristo$ and myself
but every simpleton would not be able to understand your heroism and sooner or later you #will# find yourself compelled to explain it to them more energetically than would be convenient to your bodily health and the duration of your #life#
set out for naples the hague or st petersburg calm #country# where the #point# of #honor# is better understood than among our hot headed parisians
possibly possibly said $m_beauchamp$ immediately may i give you a friendly counsel seek quietude and oblivion so that you may #return# peaceably to france after a few #year#
am i not #right# de $baron_de_château_renaud$ that is quite my #opinion# said the #gentleman# #nothing# induces serious duels so much as a duel forsworn
#thank# you #gentleman# replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with a #smile# of indifference i shall follow your advice not because you give it but because i had before intended to quit france
i #thank# you equally for the #service# you have rendered me in being my seconds it is deeply engraved on my #heart# and after what you have just said i remember that only
$baron_de_château_renaud$ and $m_beauchamp$ looked at each #other# the impression was the same on both of them and the #tone# in which $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had just expressed his #thank# was so determined that the #position# would have become embarrassing for all if the #conversation# had continued
good bye $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said $m_beauchamp$ suddenly carelessly extending his #hand# to the young #man# the latter did not appear to arouse from his lethargy in #fact# he did not notice the offered #hand#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ #lip# scarcely whispered good bye but his #look# was more explicit it expressed a whole poem of restrained anger proud disdain and generous indignation
he preserved his melancholy and motionless #position# for some #time# after his two #friend# had regained their #carriage# then suddenly unfastening his #horse# from the little #tree# to which his #servant# had tied it he mounted and galloped off in the direction of paris
good bye said $baron_de_château_renaud$ in his #turn# keeping his little cane in his left #hand# and saluting with his #right# in a #quarter# of an #hour# he was entering the $house_of_peers$ in the $rue_du_helder$
as he alighted he #thought# he saw his #father# pale #face# behind the curtain of the #count# bedroom $m_albert_de_morcerf$ turned away his #head# with a sigh and went to his own #apartment#
he cast #one# lingering #look# on all the luxuries which had rendered #life# so easy and so happy since his infancy he looked at the pictures whose #face# seemed to #smile# and the landscapes which appeared painted in brighter colors
then he took away his #mother# portrait with its oaken frame leaving the gilt frame from which he took it black and empty
then he arranged all his beautiful turkish #arm# his fine english guns his japanese china his cups mounted in silver his artistic bronzes by feuchères or barye examined the cupboards and placed the key in each threw into a drawer of his secretaire which he left open all the #pocket# #money# he had about him and with it the thousand fancy jewels from his vases and his jewel #box# then he made an exact inventory of #everything# and placed it in the most conspicuous #part# of the #table# after putting aside the books and #paper# which had collected there
at the beginning of this #work# his #servant# notwithstanding #order# to the #contrary# came to his #room# what do you want
asked he with a more sorrowful than angry #tone# pardon me #sir# replied the #valet# you had forbidden me to disturb you but the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ has called me
well said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i did not like to go to him without first seeing you why
because the #count# is doubtless aware that i accompanied you to the meeting this #morning# it is probable said $m_albert_de_morcerf$
and since he has sent for me it is doubtless to #question# me on what happened there what must i #answer#
the #truth# then i shall say the duel did not take #place# you #will# say i apologized to the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
as he was finishing this #work# the #sound# of #horse# prancing in the yard and the wheels of a #carriage# shaking his #window# attracted his #attention#
go the #valet# bowed and retired and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ returned to his inventory he approached the #window# and saw his #father# get into it and drive away
the #door# was scarcely closed when $m_albert_de_morcerf$ bent his #step# to his #mother# #room# and no #one# being there to announce him he advanced to her bedchamber and distressed by what he saw and guessed stopped for #one# #moment# at the #door#
as if the same #idea# had animated these two beings $mercédès$ was doing the same in her #apartment# that he had just done in his
#everything# was in #order# laces dresses jewels linen #money# all were arranged in the drawers and the #countess# was carefully collecting the keys
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ saw all these preparations and understood them and exclaiming my #mother# he threw his #arm# around her neck
the artist who could have depicted the #expression# of these two #countenance# would certainly have made of them a beautiful picture
all these #proof# of an energetic resolution which $m_albert_de_morcerf$ did not #fear# on his own #account# alarmed him for his #mother#
what are you doing asked he what were you doing replied she oh my #mother# exclaimed $m_albert_de_morcerf$ so overcome he could scarcely speak it is not the same with you and me
you cannot have made the same resolution i have for i have come to warn you that i bid adieu to your $house_of_peers$ and and to you
i also replied $mercédès$ am going and i acknowledge i had depended on your accompanying me have i deceived myself
i must live henceforth without rank and #fortune# and to begin this hard apprenticeship i must borrow from a #friend# the loaf i shall eat until i have earned #one#
so my dear #mother# i am going at once to ask $m_franz_de_quesnel$ to lend me the small #sum# i shall require to supply my present wants
#mother# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ with firmness i cannot make you share the fate i have planned for myself you my poor #child# suffer poverty and hunger
oh do not say so it #will# break my resolutions but not mine #mother# replied $m_albert_de_morcerf$ i am young and strong i believe i am courageous and since #yesterday# i have learned the #power# of #will#
alas my dear #mother# some have suffered so much and yet live and have raised a new #fortune# on the ruin of all the #promise# of #happiness# which heaven had made them on the fragments of all the #hope# which god had given them
i have seen that #mother# i know that from the gulf in which their #enemy# have plunged them they have risen with so much vigor and glory that in their #turn# they have ruled their former conquerors and have punished them
not even a #name# because you can understand that your #son# cannot bear the #name# of a #man# who ought to blush for it before another
no #mother# from this #moment# i have done with the past and accept #nothing# from it $m_albert_de_morcerf$ my #child# said $mercédès$ if i had a stronger #heart# that is the counsel i would have given you
your conscience has spoken when my #voice# became too weak listen to its dictates you had #friend# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ break off their acquaintance
but do not #despair# you have #life# before you my dear $m_albert_de_morcerf$ for you are yet scarcely twenty two #year# old and as a pure #heart# like yours wants a spotless #name# take my #father#
it was herrera i am sure my dear $m_albert_de_morcerf$ whatever may be your career you #will# soon render that #name# illustrious
then my #son# #return# to the #world# still more brilliant because of your former sorrows and if i am wrong still let me cherish these #hope# for i have no future to #look# forward to
for me the grave opens when i pass the threshold of this $house_of_peers$ i #will# fulfil all your #wish# my dear #mother# said the young #man#
yes i share your #hope# the anger of heaven #will# not pursue us since you are pure and i am innocent
but since our resolution is formed let us act promptly de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ went out about #half# an #hour# ago the opportunity is favorable to avoid an explanation
he recollected that there was a small furnished $house_of_peers$ to let in the rue des saints pères where his #mother# would find a humble but decent lodging and thither he intended conducting the #countess#
i am ready my #son# said $mercédès$ $m_albert_de_morcerf$ ran to fetch a #carriage# as the #carriage# stopped at the #door# and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was alighting a #man# approached and gave him a #letter#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ recognized the bearer from the #count# said $m_bertuccio$ $m_albert_de_morcerf$ took the #letter# opened and read it then looked round for $m_bertuccio$ but he was gone
he returned to $mercédès$ with #tear# in his #eye# and heaving breast and without uttering a #word# he gave her the #letter#
$mercédès$ read $m_albert_de_morcerf$ while showing you that i have discovered your #plan# i #hope# also to convince you of my delicacy
you are free you leave the #count# $house_of_peers$ and you take your #mother# to your home but reflect $m_albert_de_morcerf$ you owe her more than your poor noble #heart# can pay her
keep the struggle for yourself bear all the suffering but spare her the trial of poverty which must accompany your first #effort# for she deserves not even the #shadow# of the #misfortune# which has this #day# fallen on her and providence is not willing that the innocent should suffer for the guilty
i know you are going to leave the $rue_du_helder$ without taking #anything# with you do not seek to know how i discovered it i know it that is sufficient
i had a betrothed $m_albert_de_morcerf$ a lovely #girl# whom i adored and i was bringing to my betrothed a hundred and fifty $louis_xviii$ painfully amassed by ceaseless toil
this #money# was for her i destined it for her and knowing the treachery of the #sea# i buried our #treasure# in the little #garden# of the $house_of_peers$ my #father# lived in at marseilles on the allées de meilhan
now listen $m_albert_de_morcerf$ twenty four #year# ago i returned proud and joyful to my #country# your #mother# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ knows that poor $house_of_peers$ well
a short #time# since i passed through marseilles and went to see the old #place# which revived so many painful recollections and in the #evening# i took a spade and dug in the #corner# of the #garden# where i had concealed my #treasure#
the #iron# #box# was there no #one# had touched it under a beautiful fig #tree# my #father# had planted the #day# i was born which overshadowed the #spot#
well $m_albert_de_morcerf$ this #money# which was formerly designed to promote the comfort and tranquillity of the #woman# i adored may now through strange and painful #circumstance# be devoted to the same #purpose#
oh feel for me who could offer #million# to that poor #woman# but who #return# her only the #piece# of black bread forgotten under my poor roof since the #day# i was torn from her i loved
you are a generous #man# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ but perhaps you may be blinded by pride or resentment if you refuse me if you ask another for what i have a #right# to offer you i #will# say it is ungenerous of you to refuse the #life# of your #mother# at the #hand# of a #man# whose #father# was allowed by your #father# to die in all the horrors of poverty and #despair#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ stood pale and motionless to hear what his #mother# would decide after she had finished reading this #letter#
$mercédès$ turned her #eye# with an ineffable #look# towards heaven i accept it said she he has a #right# to pay the dowry which i shall take with me to some convent
putting the #letter# in her bosom she took her #son# #arm# and with a firmer #step# than she even herself expected she went downstairs
$m_emmanuel$ did not conceal his #joy# at the peaceful termination of the #affair# and was loud in his #expression# of delight
$m_maximilian_morrel$ in a #corner# of the #carriage# allowed his #brother# in #law# gayety to expend itself in #word# while he felt equal inward #joy# which however betrayed itself only in his #countenance#
#chapter# the suicide meanwhile $m_de_monte_cristo$ had also returned to town with $m_emmanuel$ and $m_maximilian_morrel$ their #return# was cheerful at the barrière du trône they met $m_bertuccio$ who was waiting there
$m_de_monte_cristo$ put his #head# out of the #window# exchanged a few #word# with him in a low #tone# and the steward disappeared
#count# said $m_emmanuel$ when they were at the #end# of the #place# royale put me down at my #door# that my #wife# may not have a single #moment# of needless anxiety on my #account# or yours
if it were not ridiculous to make a display of our triumph said $m_maximilian_morrel$ i would invite the #count# to our $house_of_peers$ besides that he doubtless has some trembling #heart# to comfort
motionless as a sentinel at his post so we #will# take leave of our #friend# and let him hasten home
#return# $m_emmanuel$ to your charming #wife# and present my best compliments to her and do you $m_maximilian_morrel$ accompany me to the champs élysées
stop a #moment# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ do not let me lose both my #companion# willingly said $m_maximilian_morrel$ particularly as i have #business# in that #quarter#
shall we wait breakfast for you asked $m_emmanuel$ no replied the young #man# the #door# was closed and the #carriage# proceeded
see what good #fortune# i brought you said $m_maximilian_morrel$ when he was alone with the #count# have you not #thought# so
yes said $m_de_monte_cristo$ for that #reason# i wished to keep you near me it is miraculous
continued $m_maximilian_morrel$ answering his own #thought# what said $m_de_monte_cristo$ what has just happened yes said the #count# you are #right#
it is miraculous for $m_albert_de_morcerf$ is brave resumed $m_maximilian_morrel$ very brave said $m_de_monte_cristo$ i have seen him sleep with a sword suspended over his #head#
and i know he has fought two duels said $m_maximilian_morrel$ how can you reconcile that with his conduct this #morning#
all owing to your influence replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ smiling it is well for $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he is not in the army said $m_maximilian_morrel$
why an apology on the #ground# said the young #captain# shaking his #head# come said the #count# mildly do not entertain the prejudices of ordinary #man# $m_maximilian_morrel$
acknowledge that if $m_albert_de_morcerf$ is brave he cannot be a coward he must then have had some #reason# for acting as he did this #morning# and confess that his conduct is more heroic than otherwise
doubtless doubtless said $m_maximilian_morrel$ but i shall say like the spaniard he has not been so brave #today# as he was #yesterday#
you #will# breakfast with me #will# you not $m_maximilian_morrel$ said the #count# to #turn# the #conversation# no i must leave you at ten clock
your engagement was for breakfast then said the #count# $m_maximilian_morrel$ smiled and shook his #head# still you must breakfast somewhere
but if i am not hungry said the young #man# oh said the #count# i only know two #thing# which destroy the appetite #grief# and
as i am happy to see you very cheerful it is not that and #love# now after what you told me this #morning# of your #heart# i may believe
but you #will# not make me your confidant $m_maximilian_morrel$ said the #count# in a #tone# which showed how gladly he would have been admitted to the #secret#
well #count# replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ gayly i #will# not dispute it i showed you this #morning# that i had a #heart# did i not #count#
well continued the latter since that #heart# is no longer with you in the bois de vincennes it is elsewhere and i must go and find it
go said the #count# deliberately go dear #friend# but #promise# me if you meet with any obstacle to remember that i have some #power# in this #world# that i am happy to #use# that #power# in the behalf of those i #love# and that i #love# you $m_maximilian_morrel$
$m_de_monte_cristo$ only answered by extending his #hand# to the young #man# i #will# remember it said the young #man# as selfish #child# recollect their parents when they want their aid
when i need your assistance and the #moment# arrives i #will# come to you #count# well i rely upon your #promise#
good bye then good bye till we meet again they had arrived in the champs élysées $m_de_monte_cristo$ opened the #carriage# #door# $m_maximilian_morrel$ sprang out on the pavement $m_bertuccio$ was waiting on the #step#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ disappeared down the avenue de marigny and $m_de_monte_cristo$ hastened to join $m_bertuccio$ well asked he she is going to leave her $house_of_peers$ said the steward
and her #son# florentin his #valet# thinks he is going to do the same come this #way# $m_de_monte_cristo$ took $m_bertuccio$ into his #study# wrote the #letter# we have seen and gave it to the steward
here i am said the young #girl# who at the #sound# of the #carriage# had run downstairs and whose #face# was radiant with #joy# at seeing the #count# #return# safely
every transport of a #daughter# finding a #father# all the delight of a mistress seeing an adored lover were felt by $haydée$ during the first #moment# of this meeting which she had so eagerly expected
go said he quickly but first let $haydée$ be informed that i have returned $m_bertuccio$ left doubtless although less evident $m_de_monte_cristo$ #joy# was not less intense
#joy# to #heart# which have suffered long is like the dew on the #ground# after a long drought both the #heart# and the #ground# absorb that beneficent moisture falling on them and #nothing# is outwardly apparent
$m_de_monte_cristo$ was beginning to think what he had not for a long #time# dared to believe that there were two $mercédès$ in the #world# and he might yet be happy
his #eye# elate with #happiness# was reading eagerly the tearful gaze of $haydée$ when suddenly the #door# opened the #count# knit his #brow#
de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said $monsieur_baptistin$ as if that #name# sufficed for his excuse in #fact# the #count# #face# brightened
which asked he the viscount or the #count# the #count# oh exclaimed $haydée$ is it not yet over
i know not if it is finished my beloved #child# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ taking the young #girl# #hand# but i do know you have #nothing# more to #fear#
but it is the wretched that #man# cannot injure me $haydée$ said $m_de_monte_cristo$ it was his #son# alone that there was cause to #fear#
and what i have suffered said the young #girl# you shall never know my lord $m_de_monte_cristo$ smiled
by my #father# tomb said he extending his #hand# over the #head# of the young #girl# i swear to you $haydée$ that if any #misfortune# happens it #will# not be to me
i believe you my lord as implicitly as if god had spoken to me said the young #girl# presenting her #forehead# to him
$m_de_monte_cristo$ pressed on that pure beautiful #forehead# a kiss which made two #heart# throb at once the #one# violently the #other# secretly
ask de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ into the #drawing# #room# said he to $monsieur_baptistin$ while he led the beautiful greek #girl# to a private #staircase#
oh murmured the #count# shall i then be permitted to #love# again we must explain this #visit# which although expected by $m_de_monte_cristo$ is unexpected to our readers
while $mercédès$ as we have said was making a similar inventory of her property to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ while she was arranging her jewels shutting her drawers collecting her keys to leave #everything# in perfect #order# she did not perceive a pale and sinister #face# at a #glass# #door# which threw #light# into the passage from which #everything# could be both seen and heard
he who was thus looking without being heard or seen probably heard and saw all that passed in #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #apartment#
from that #glass# #door# the pale faced #man# went to the #count# bedroom and raised with a constricted #hand# the curtain of a #window# overlooking the courtyard
he remained there ten #minute# motionless and dumb listening to the beating of his own #heart# for him those ten #minute# were very long
it was then $m_albert_de_morcerf$ returning from his meeting with the #count# perceived his #father# watching for his arrival behind a curtain and turned aside
the #count# #eye# expanded he knew $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had insulted the #count# dreadfully and that in every #country# in the #world# such an insult would lead to a deadly duel
an indescribable ray of #joy# illumined that wretched #countenance# like the last ray of the sun before it disappears behind the clouds which bear the aspect not of a downy couch but of a tomb
but as we have said he waited in vain for his #son# to come to his #apartment# with the #account# of his triumph
he easily understood why his #son# did not come to see him before he went to avenge his #father# #honor# but when that was done why did not his #son# come and throw himself into his #arm#
it was then when the #count# could not see $m_albert_de_morcerf$ that he sent for his #servant# who he knew was authorized not to conceal #anything# from him
ten #minute# afterwards general $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was seen on the #step# in a black coat with a military collar black pantaloons and black gloves
he had apparently given previous #order# for as he reached the bottom #step# his #carriage# came from the coach $house_of_peers$ ready for him
the #valet# threw into the #carriage# his military cloak in which two swords were wrapped and shutting the #door# he took his #seat# by the #side# of the coachman
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ returned safely then the #count# was revenged the coachman stooped down for his #order# to the champs élysées said the general the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ opened the #door# himself and as the #carriage# rolled away he passed up the walk rang and entered the open #door# with his #servant#
a #moment# afterwards $monsieur_baptistin$ announced the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ to $m_de_monte_cristo$ and the latter leading $haydée$ aside ordered that $m_albert_de_morcerf$ be asked into the #drawing# #room#
hurry the #horse# bounded beneath the whip and in five #minute# they stopped before the #count# #door# the general was pacing the #room# the third #time# when in turning he perceived $m_de_monte_cristo$ at the #door#
ah it is de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said $m_de_monte_cristo$ quietly i #thought# i had not heard aright
yes it is i said the #count# whom a frightful contraction of the #lip# prevented from articulating freely may i know the
cause which procures me the #pleasure# of seeing de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ so early had you not a meeting with my #son# this #morning#
asked the general i had replied the #count# and i know my #son# had good #reason# to #wish# to fight with you and to endeavor to kill you
yes #sir# he had very good #one# but you see that in #spite# of them he has not killed me and did not even fight
yet he considered you the cause of his #father# dishonor the cause of the fearful ruin which has fallen on my $house_of_peers$
it is true #sir# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ with his dreadful calmness a secondary cause but not the principal
doubtless you made then some apology or explanation i explained #nothing# and it is he who apologized to me
but to what do you attribute this conduct to the conviction probably that there was #one# more guilty than i
and who was that his #father# that may be said the #count# turning pale but you know the guilty do not like to find themselves convicted
i know it and i expected this result you expected my #son# would be a coward cried the #count#
a #man# who holds a sword in his #hand# and sees a mortal #enemy# within reach of that sword and does not fight is a coward
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ is no coward said $m_de_monte_cristo$ why is he not here that i may tell him so
#sir# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ coldly i did not expect that you had come here to relate to me your little #family# #affair#
go and tell $m_albert_de_morcerf$ that and he may know what to #answer# you oh no no said the general smiling faintly
i did not come for that #purpose# you are #right# i came to tell you that i also #look# upon you as my #enemy#
i came to tell you that i hate you instinctively that it seems as if i had always known you and always hated you and in short since the young #people# of the present #day# #will# not fight it remains for us to do so
do you think so #sir# certainly and when i told you i had foreseen the result it is the #honor# of your #visit# i alluded to
you know that we shall fight till #one# of us is dead said the general whose teeth were clenched with rage
so much the better are you prepared yes #sir# until #one# of us dies repeated $m_de_monte_cristo$ moving his #head# slightly up and down
let us start then we need no witnesses very true said $m_de_monte_cristo$ it is unnecessary we know each #other# so well
on the #contrary# said the #count# we know so little of each #other# indeed said $m_de_monte_cristo$ with the same indomitable coolness let us see
are you not the #soldier# $m_fernand_mondego$ who deserted on the eve of the battle of waterloo are you not the lieutenant $m_fernand_mondego$ who served as guide and spy to the french army in spain
are you not the #captain# $m_fernand_mondego$ who betrayed sold and murdered his benefactor $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and have not all these fernands united made lieutenant general the #count# of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ peer of france
oh cried the general as if branded with a hot #iron# wretch to reproach me with my shame when about perhaps to kill me
i know well demon that you have penetrated into the #darkness# of the past and that you have read by the #light# of what torch i know not every page of my #life# but perhaps i may be more honorable in my shame than you under your pompous coverings
no i am aware you know me but i know you only as an adventurer sewn up in #gold# and jewellery
no i did not say i was a #stranger# to you no you call yourself in paris the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ in italy sinbad the #sailor# in malta i forget what
but it is your real #name# i want to know in the midst of your hundred #name# that i may pronounce it when we meet to fight at the #moment# when i plunge my sword through your #heart#
he leaped towards a dressing #room# near his bedroom and in less than a #moment# tearing off his cravat his coat and waistcoat he put on a #sailor# jacket and hat from beneath which rolled his long black #hair#
he returned thus formidable and implacable advancing with his #arm# crossed on his breast towards the general who could not understand why he had disappeared but who on seeing him again and #feeling# his teeth chatter and his legs sink under him drew back and only stopped when he found a #table# to support his clenched #hand#
the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ turned dreadfully pale his #eye# seemed to burn with a devouring #fire# $m_fernand_mondego$ cried he of my hundred #name# i need only tell you #one# to overwhelm you
for notwithstanding all my sorrows and my tortures i show you #today# a #face# which the #happiness# of revenge makes young again a #face# you must often have seen in your #dream# since your #marriage# with $mercédès$ my betrothed
the general with his #head# thrown back #hand# extended gaze fixed looked silently at this dreadful apparition then seeking the #wall# to support him he glided along close to it until he reached the #door# through which he went out backwards uttering this single mournful lamentable distressing #cry#
then with sighs which were unlike any human #sound# he dragged himself to the #door# reeled across the courtyard and falling into the #arm# of his #valet# he said in a #voice# scarcely intelligible home home
the fresh #air# and the shame he felt at having exposed himself before his #servant# partly recalled his senses but the ride was short and as he drew near his $house_of_peers$ all his wretchedness revived
but you guess it now do you not or rather you remember it $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ he stopped at a short #distance# from the $house_of_peers$ and alighted
the #door# was wide open a hackney coach was standing in the middle of the yard a strange #sight# before so noble a mansion the #count# looked at it with #terror# but without daring to inquire its meaning he rushed towards his #apartment#
two #person# were coming down the stairs he had only #time# to creep into an alcove to avoid them it was $mercédès$ leaning on her #son#
they passed close by the unhappy being who concealed behind the damask curtain almost felt $mercédès$ dress brush past him and his #son# warm breath pronouncing these #word#
#arm# and leaving the $house_of_peers$ courage #mother# come this is no longer our home the #word# died away the #step# were lost in the #distance#
the general drew himself up clinging to the curtain he uttered the most dreadful sob which ever escaped from the bosom of a #father# abandoned at the same #time# by his #wife# and #son#
he soon heard the clatter of the #iron# #step# of the hackney coach then the coachman #voice# and then the rolling of the heavy vehicle shook the #window#
he darted to his bedroom to see once more all he had loved in the #world# but the hackney coach drove on and the #head# of neither $mercédès$ nor her #son# appeared at the #window# to take a last #look# at the $house_of_peers$ or the deserted #father# and #husband#
and at the very #moment# when the wheels of that coach crossed the gateway a report was heard and a thick smoke escaped through #one# of the panes of the #window# which was broken by the explosion
on leaving $m_de_monte_cristo$ he walked slowly towards $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ we say slowly for $m_maximilian_morrel$ had more than #half# an #hour# to spare to go five hundred #step# but he had hastened to take leave of $m_de_monte_cristo$ because he wished to be alone with his #thought#
well the #hour# when $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was giving $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ his breakfast and was sure not to be disturbed in the performance of this pious #duty#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had given him leave to go twice a week and he was now availing himself of that permission
#chapter# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ we may easily conceive where $m_maximilian_morrel$ appointment was he knew his #time# he arrived $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was expecting him
this uneasiness amounting almost to frenzy arose from the report $m_albert_de_morcerf$ adventure had made in the #world# for the #affair# at the opera was generally known
uneasy and almost crazed she seized his #hand# and led him to her #grandfather# no #one# at $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ doubted that a duel would ensue from it
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ with her #woman# instinct guessed that $m_maximilian_morrel$ would be $m_de_monte_cristo$ second and from the young #man# well known courage and his great affection for the #count# she feared that he would not content himself with the passive #part# assigned to him
we may easily understand how eagerly the particulars were asked for given and received and $m_maximilian_morrel$ could read an indescribable #joy# in the #eye# of his beloved when she knew that the termination of this #affair# was as happy as it was unexpected
now said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ motioning to $m_maximilian_morrel$ to sit down near her #grandfather# while she took her #seat# on his footstool now
let us talk about our own #affair# you know $m_maximilian_morrel$ grandpapa once #thought# of leaving this $house_of_peers$ and taking an #apartment# away from $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
yes said $m_maximilian_morrel$ i recollect the project of which i highly approved well said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ you may approve again for grandpapa is again thinking of it
bravo said $m_maximilian_morrel$ and do you know said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ what #reason# grandpapa gives for leaving this $house_of_peers$
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looked at $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ to impose #silence# but she did not notice him her #look# her #eye# her #smile# were all for $m_maximilian_morrel$
oh whatever may be $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #reason# answered $m_maximilian_morrel$ i can readily believe it to be a good #one#
an excellent #one# said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ he pretends the #air# of the $faubourg_saint_honoré$ is not good for me
indeed said $m_maximilian_morrel$ in that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ may be #right# you have not seemed to be well for the last fortnight
not very said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and grandpapa has become my physician and i have the greatest confidence in him because he knows #everything#
do you then really suffer asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ quickly oh it must not be called suffering i feel a general uneasiness that is all
i have lost my appetite and my stomach feels as if it were struggling to get accustomed to #something# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ did not lose a #word# of what $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said
and what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint a very simple #one# said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ i swallow every #morning# a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my #grandfather#
when i say #one# spoonful i began by #one# now i take four grandpapa says it is a panacea $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ smiled but it was evident that she suffered
she was very beautiful but her usual pallor had increased her #eye# were more brilliant than ever and her #hand# which were generally white like #mother# of pearl now more resembled wax to which #time# was adding a yellowish hue
the latter watched with strange and deep #interest# the young #girl# absorbed by her affection and he also like $m_maximilian_morrel$ followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of #everyone# but the #grandfather# and the lover
$m_maximilian_morrel$ in his devotedness gazed silently at her from $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ the young #man# looked towards $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ but said $m_maximilian_morrel$
i know it is very bitter said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ so bitter that all i drink afterwards appears to have the same taste
i #thought# this mixture of which you now take four spoonfuls was prepared for $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ noirtier looked inquiringly at his granddaughter
just now before i came down to you i drank a #glass# of sugared #water# i left #half# because it seemed so bitter
yes grandpapa said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ it is so $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ turned pale and made a #sign# that he wished to speak
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ rose to fetch the dictionary $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ watched her with evident anguish in #fact# the #blood# was rushing to the young #girl# #head# already her cheeks were becoming red
oh cried she without losing any of her cheerfulness this is singular i cant see did the sun shine in my #eye#
and she leaned against the #window# the sun is not shining said $m_maximilian_morrel$ more alarmed by $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #expression# than by $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ indisposition
he ran towards her the young #girl# smiled cheer up said she to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ do not be alarmed $m_maximilian_morrel$ it is #nothing# and has already passed away
but listen do i not hear a #carriage# in the courtyard she opened $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #door# ran to a #window# in the passage and returned hastily
yes said she it is #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and her #daughter# who have come to call on us good bye i must run away for they would send here for me or rather farewell till i see you again
$m_maximilian_morrel$ watched her as she left the #room# he heard her ascend the little #staircase# which led both to #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #apartment# and to hers
stay with grandpapa $m_maximilian_morrel$ i #promise# you not to persuade them to stay as soon as she was gone $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ made a #sign# to $m_maximilian_morrel$ to take the dictionary
accustomed however as he was to the #work# he had to repeat most of the #letter# of the alphabet and to find every #word# in the dictionary so that it was ten #minute# before the #thought# of the old #man# was translated by these #word#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ obeyed guided by $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ he had learned how to understand the old #man# quickly fetch the #glass# of #water# and the decanter from $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #room#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ rang immediately for the #servant# who had taken $barrois$ situation and in $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #name# gave that #order# the #servant# soon returned
the decanter and the #glass# were completely empty $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ made a #sign# that he wished to speak why are the #glass# and decanter empty
asked he $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said she only drank #half# the glassful the translation of this new #question# occupied another five #minute#
i do not know said the #servant# but the housemaid is in $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #room# perhaps she has emptied them
ask her said $m_maximilian_morrel$ translating $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #thought# this #time# by his #look# the #servant# went out but returned almost immediately
and in passing as she was thirsty she drank what remained in the #glass# as for the decanter #master# $edward$ had emptied that to make a pond for his ducks
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ passed through the #room# to go to #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ said he $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ raised his #eye# to heaven as a gambler does who stakes his all on #one# stroke
it was indeed #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and her #daughter# whom $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had seen they had been ushered into #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #room# who had said she would receive them there
that is why $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ passed through her #room# which was on a level with $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and only separated from it by $edward$
from that #moment# the old #man# #eye# were fixed on the #door# and did not quit it the two #lady# entered the #drawing# #room# with that #sort# of official stiffness which preludes a formal communication
among worldly #people# #manner# is contagious #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ received them with equal solemnity $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ entered at this #moment# and the formalities were resumed
i and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ are come to be the first to announce to you the approaching #marriage# of my #daughter# with prince $monsieur_cavalcanti$
my dear #friend# said the #baroness# while the two young #people# were shaking #hand# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ kept up the title of prince
the popular #banker# found that it answered better than #count# allow me to present you my sincere congratulations replied #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
listen said the #baroness# smiling speaking to you as a #friend# i can say that the prince does not yet appear all he #will# be
he has about him a little of that foreign #manner# by which french #person# recognize at first #sight# the italian or german nobleman
besides he gives evidence of great kindness of disposition much keenness of wit and as to suitability $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ assures me that his #fortune# is majestic that is his #word#
and then said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ while turning over the leaves of #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ album add that you have taken a great fancy to the young #man#
prince $monsieur_cavalcanti$ appears to be a young #man# of rare qualities and said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
i need not ask you if you share that fancy i replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with her usual candor
my #wish# was not to confine myself to domestic #care# or the caprices of any #man# but to be an artist and consequently free in #heart# in #person# and in #thought#
oh not the least in the #world# #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ pronounced these #word# with so firm a #tone# that the color mounted to $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ cheeks
at any rate said she since i am to be married whether i #will# or not i ought to be thankful to providence for having released me from my engagement with $m_albert_de_morcerf$ or i should this #day# have been the #wife# of a dishonored #man#
the timid #girl# could not understand that vigorous #nature# which appeared to have none of the timidities of #woman#
it is true said the #baroness# with that strange simplicity sometimes met with among fashionable #lady# and of which plebeian intercourse can never entirely deprive them it is very true that had not the morcerfs hesitated my #daughter# would have married $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_albert_de_morcerf$
the general depended much on it he even came to force $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ we have had a narrow escape
but said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ timidly does all the #father# shame revert upon the #son# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_albert_de_morcerf$ appears to me quite innocent of the treason charged against the general
excuse me said the implacable young #girl# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_albert_de_morcerf$ claims and well deserves his share it appears that after having challenged de $m_de_monte_cristo$ at the opera #yesterday# he apologized on the #ground# #today#
impossible said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ ah my dear #friend# said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with the same simplicity we before noticed
it is a #fact# i heard it from $m_lucien_debray$ who was present at the explanation $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ also knew the #truth# but she did not #answer#
a single #word# had reminded her that $m_maximilian_morrel$ was expecting her in $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #room# deeply engaged with a #sort# of inward contemplation $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had ceased for a #moment# to join in the #conversation#
she would indeed have found it impossible to repeat what had been said the last few #minute# when suddenly #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #hand# pressed on her #arm# aroused her from her lethargy
what is it said she starting at #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ touch as she would have done from an electric shock
it is my dear $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said the #baroness# that you are doubtless suffering i said the young #girl# passing her #hand# across her burning #forehead#
yes #look# at yourself in that #glass# you have turned pale and then red successively three or four #time# in #one# #minute#
indeed cried $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ you are very pale oh do not be alarmed i have been so for many #day#
artless as she was the young #girl# knew that this was an opportunity to leave and besides #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ came to her assistance
retire $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said she you are really suffering and these #lady# #will# excuse you drink a #glass# of pure #water# it #will# restore you
that poor #child# said #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ when $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was gone she makes me very uneasy and i should not be astonished if she had some serious illness
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ kissed $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ bowed to #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who had already risen to take her leave and went out
meanwhile $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ in a #sort# of excitement which she could not quite understand had crossed $edward$ #room# without noticing some trick of the #child# and through her own had reached the little #staircase#
she was within three #step# of the bottom she already heard $m_maximilian_morrel$ #voice# when suddenly a cloud passed over her #eye# her stiffened #foot# missed the #step# her #hand# had no #power# to hold the baluster and falling against the #wall# she lost her balance wholly and toppled to the #floor#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ bounded to the #door# opened it and found $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ stretched out at the bottom of the stairs quick as a flash he raised her in his #arm# and placed her in a #chair#
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ opened her #eye# oh what a clumsy #thing# i am said she with feverish volubility i dont know my #way#
i forgot there were three more #step# before the landing you have hurt yourself perhaps said $m_maximilian_morrel$ what can i do for you $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ looked around her she saw the deepest #terror# depicted in $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #eye# dont worry dear grandpapa said she endeavoring to #smile#
it is #nothing# it is #nothing# i was giddy that is all another attack of giddiness said $m_maximilian_morrel$ clasping his #hand#
oh attend to it $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ i entreat you but no said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ no i tell you it is all past and it was #nothing#
now let me tell you some news $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is to be married in a week and in three #day# there is to be a grand feast a betrothal festival
we are all invited my #father# #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and i at least i understood it so when #will# it be our #turn# to think of these #thing#
oh $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ you who have so much influence over your grandpapa try to make him #answer# soon and do you said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ depend on me to stimulate the tardiness and arouse the memory of grandpapa
yes cried $m_maximilian_morrel$ make haste so long as you are not mine $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ i shall always think i may lose you
oh replied $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ with a convulsive movement oh indeed $m_maximilian_morrel$ you are too timid for an #officer# for a #soldier# who they say never knows #fear#
she burst into a forced and melancholy laugh her #arm# stiffened and twisted her #head# fell back on her #chair# and she remained motionless
ha ha ha the #cry# of #terror# which was stopped on $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #lip# seemed to start from his #eye# $m_maximilian_morrel$ understood it he knew he must call assistance
the young #man# rang the bell violently the housemaid who had been in $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #room# and the #servant# who had replaced $barrois$ ran in at the same #moment#
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was so pale so cold so inanimate that without listening to what was said to them they were seized with the #fear# which pervaded that $house_of_peers$ and they flew into the passage crying for help
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ were going out at that #moment# they heard the cause of the disturbance i told you so
exclaimed #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ poor #child# #chapter# $m_maximilian_morrel$ avowal at the same #moment# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #voice# was heard calling from his #study#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ looked at $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who had recovered his self command and with a #glance# indicated the closet where once before under somewhat similar #circumstance# he had taken refuge
what is the #matter# he had only #time# to get his hat and throw himself breathless into the closet when the #procureur# footstep was heard in the passage
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ sprang into the #room# ran to $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and took her in his #arm# a physician a physician $m_d_avrigny$ cried $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
or rather i #will# go for him myself he flew from the #apartment# and $m_maximilian_morrel$ at the same #moment# darted out at the #other# #door#
he had been struck to the #heart# by a frightful recollection the #conversation# he had heard between the #doctor# and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
the #night# of $madame_de_saint_méran$ #death# recurred to him these symptoms to a less alarming extent were the same which had preceded the #death# of $barrois$
at the same #time# $m_de_monte_cristo$ #voice# seemed to resound in his ear with the #word# he had heard only two #hour# before
whatever you want $m_maximilian_morrel$ come to me i have great #power# more rapidly than #thought# he darted down the rue matignon and thence to the avenue des champs élysées
meanwhile $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ arrived in a hired cabriolet at $m_d_avrigny$ #door# he rang so violently that the porter was alarmed
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ ran upstairs without saying a #word# the porter knew him and let him pass only calling to him in his #study# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ #procureur# in his #study#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ pushed or rather forced the #door# open ah said the #doctor# is it you yes said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ closing the #door# after him
it is i who am come in my #turn# to ask you if we are quite alone #doctor# my $house_of_peers$ is accursed
what said the latter with apparent coolness but with deep #emotion# have you another invalid yes #doctor# cried $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ clutching his #hair# yes
avrigny #look# implied i told you it would be so then he slowly uttered these #word# who is now dying in your $house_of_peers$
what new victim is going to accuse you of weakness before god a mournful sob burst from $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #heart# he approached the #doctor# and seizing his #arm# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said he
you see you were deceived murmured the #magistrate# come and see her and on her #bed# of agony entreat her pardon for having suspected her
it is $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #turn# your #daughter# cried avrigny with #grief# and surprise each #time# you have applied to me said the #doctor#
but let us make haste #sir# with the #enemy# you have to do with there is no #time# to be lost
it has been too late still i #will# go oh this #time# #doctor# you shall not have to reproach me with weakness
this #time# i #will# know the assassin and #will# pursue him let us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging her said avrigny
the same cabriolet which had brought $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ took them back at full speed and at this #moment# $m_maximilian_morrel$ rapped at $m_de_monte_cristo$ #door#
come the #count# was in his #study# and was reading with an angry #look# #something# which $m_bertuccio$ had brought in haste
hearing the #name# of $m_maximilian_morrel$ who had left him only two #hour# before the #count# raised his #head# arose and sprang to meet him
what is the #matter# $m_maximilian_morrel$ asked he you are pale and the perspiration rolls from your #forehead#
are all your #family# well asked the #count# with an affectionate benevolence whose sincerity no #one# could for a #moment# #doubt#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ fell into a #chair# yes said he i came quickly i wanted to speak to you
#thank# you #count# #thank# you said the young #man# evidently embarrassed how to begin the #conversation# yes #everyone# in my #family# is well
so much the better yet you have #something# to tell me replied the #count# with increased anxiety
yes said $m_maximilian_morrel$ it is true i have but now left a $house_of_peers$ where #death# has just entered to run to you
are you then come from de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ asked $m_de_monte_cristo$ no said $m_maximilian_morrel$ is someone dead in his $house_of_peers$
the general has just blown his brains out replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ with great coolness oh what a dreadful #event#
not for the #countess# or for $m_albert_de_morcerf$ said $m_de_monte_cristo$ a dead #father# or #husband# is better than a dishonored #one# #blood# washes out shame
cried $m_maximilian_morrel$ poor #countess# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ i #pity# her very much she is so noble a #woman#
#pity# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ also $m_maximilian_morrel$ for believe me he is the worthy #son# of the #countess# but let us #return# to yourself
yes i need your help that is i #thought# like a madman that you could lend me your assistance in a #case# where god alone can succor me
you have hastened to me can i have the #happiness# of being useful to you tell me what it is replied $m_de_monte_cristo$
i know not indeed if i may reveal this #secret# to mortal ears but fatality impels me necessity constrains me #count# $m_maximilian_morrel$ hesitated
oh said $m_maximilian_morrel$ do you think i #love# you said $m_de_monte_cristo$ taking the young #man# #hand# affectionately in his
oh you encourage me and #something# tells me there placing his #hand# on his #heart# that i ought to have no #secret# from you
you are #right# $m_maximilian_morrel$ god is speaking to your #heart# and your #heart# speaks to you tell me what it says
#count# #will# you allow me to send $monsieur_baptistin$ to inquire after someone you know i am at your #service# and still more my #servant#
oh i cannot live if she is not better shall i ring for $monsieur_baptistin$ no i #will# go and speak to him myself
$m_maximilian_morrel$ went out called $monsieur_baptistin$ and whispered a few #word# to him the #valet# ran directly well have you sent
asked $m_de_monte_cristo$ seeing $m_maximilian_morrel$ #return# yes and now i shall be more calm you know i am waiting said $m_de_monte_cristo$ smiling
yes and i #will# tell you #one# #evening# i was in a #garden# a clump of #tree# concealed me no #one# suspected i was there
allow me to conceal their #name# for the present they were speaking in an undertone and yet i was so interested in what they said that i did not lose a single #word#
two #person# passed near me this is a gloomy introduction if i may judge from your pallor and shuddering $m_maximilian_morrel$
oh yes very gloomy my #friend# someone had just died in the $house_of_peers$ to which that #garden# belonged #one# of the #person# whose #conversation# i overheard was the #master# of the $house_of_peers$ the #other# the physician
the former was confiding to the latter his #grief# and #fear# for it was the second #time# within a #month# that #death# had suddenly and unexpectedly entered that $house_of_peers$ which was apparently destined to destruction by some exterminating angel as an object of god anger
ah indeed said $m_de_monte_cristo$ looking earnestly at the young #man# and by an imperceptible movement turning his #chair# so that he remained in the shade while the #light# fell full on $m_maximilian_morrel$ #face#
yes continued $m_maximilian_morrel$ #death# had entered that $house_of_peers$ twice within #one# #month# and what did the #doctor# #answer#
asked $m_de_monte_cristo$ he replied he replied that the #death# was not a natural #one# and must be attributed
indeed said $m_de_monte_cristo$ with a slight cough which in #moment# of extreme #emotion# helped him to disguise a blush or his pallor or the intense #interest# with which he listened
yes my dear #count# i heard it and the #doctor# added that if another #death# occurred in a similar #way# he must appeal to #justice#
to what to #poison# indeed $m_maximilian_morrel$ did you hear that $m_de_monte_cristo$ listened or appeared to do so with the greatest calmness
well said $m_maximilian_morrel$ #death# came a third #time# and neither the #master# of the $house_of_peers$ nor the #doctor# said a #word#
#death# is now perhaps striking a fourth blow #count# what am i bound to do being in #possession# of this #secret#
i know the $house_of_peers$ where you heard it or #one# very similar to it a $house_of_peers$ with a #garden# a #master# a physician and where there have been three unexpected and sudden #death#
well i have not intercepted your confidence and yet i know all that as well as you and i have no conscientious scruples
my dear #friend# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ you appear to be relating an adventure which we all know by #heart# no it does not concern me
you say an exterminating angel appears to have devoted that $house_of_peers$ to god anger well who says your supposition is not reality
if it is god #justice# instead of his anger which is walking through that $house_of_peers$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ #turn# away your #face# and let his #justice# accomplish its #purpose#
do not notice #thing# which those whose #interest# it is to see them pass over $m_maximilian_morrel$ shuddered there was #something# mournful solemn and terrible in the #count# #manner#
besides continued he in so changed a #tone# that no #one# would have supposed it was the same #person# speaking besides who says that it #will# begin again
it has returned #count# exclaimed $m_maximilian_morrel$ that is why i hastened to you well what do you #wish# me to do
do you #wish# me for instance to give information to the #procureur# $m_de_monte_cristo$ uttered the last #word# with so much meaning that $m_maximilian_morrel$ starting up cried out
perfectly well my good #friend# and i #will# prove it to you by putting the dots to the i or rather by naming the #person#
you were walking #one# #evening# in $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #garden# from what you relate i suppose it to have been the #evening# of
you heard $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ talking to $m_d_avrigny$ about the #death# of de $madame_de_saint_méran$ and that no less surprising of the #countess#
m avrigny said he believed they both proceeded from #poison# and you honest #man# have ever since been asking your #heart# and sounding your conscience to know if you ought to expose or conceal this #secret#
we are no longer in the middle #age# there is no longer a vehmgericht or free tribunals what do you want to ask these #people#
you know of whom i speak #count# do you not $madame_de_saint_méran$ #death# conscience what hast thou to do with me
my dear #fellow# let them sleep on if they are asleep let them grow pale in their drowsiness if they are disposed to do so and pray do you remain in peace who have no remorse to disturb you
as sterne said deep #grief# was depicted on $m_maximilian_morrel$ #feature# he seized $m_de_monte_cristo$ #hand# but it is beginning again i say
well said the #count# astonished at his perseverance which he could not understand and looking still more earnestly at $m_maximilian_morrel$ let it begin
again it is like the $house_of_peers$ of the atreidae god has condemned them and they must submit to their punishment
they #will# all disappear like the fabrics #child# build with cards and which fall #one# by #one# under the breath of their builder even if there are two hundred of them
three #month# since it was de $madame_de_saint_méran$ $madame_de_saint_méran$ two #month# since the #other# #day# it was $barrois$ #today# the old $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ or young $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
cried $m_maximilian_morrel$ in such a paroxysm of #terror# that $m_de_monte_cristo$ started he whom the falling heavens would have found unmoved you knew it and said #nothing#
you knew it and what is it to me replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ shrugging his #shoulder# do i know those #people#
and must i lose the #one# to save the #other# faith no for between the culprit and the victim i have no choice
but i cried $m_maximilian_morrel$ groaning with sorrow i #love# her you #love# whom cried $m_de_monte_cristo$ starting to his #foot# and seizing the two #hand# which $m_maximilian_morrel$ was raising towards heaven
i #love# most fondly i #love# madly i #love# as a #man# who would give his #life# #blood# to spare her a #tear#
i #love# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who is being murdered at this #moment# do you understand me i #love# her and i ask god and you how i can save her
$m_de_monte_cristo$ uttered a #cry# which those only can conceive who have heard the roar of a wounded lion unhappy #man# cried he wringing his #hand# in his #turn# you #love# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ that #daughter# of an accursed race
never had the genius of #terror# he had so often seen either on the battle field or in the murderous #night# of algeria shaken around him more dreadful #fire#
never had $m_maximilian_morrel$ witnessed such an #expression# never had so terrible an #eye# flashed before his #face# he drew back terrified
in a #moment# he restrained himself so powerfully that the tempestuous heaving of his breast subsided as turbulent and foaming waves yield to the sun genial influence when the cloud has passed
as for $m_de_monte_cristo$ after this ebullition he closed his #eye# as if dazzled by internal #light# this #silence# self control and struggle lasted about twenty seconds then the #count# raised his pallid #face#
my dear #friend# how god punishes the most thoughtless and unfeeling #man# for their indifference by presenting dreadful #scene# to their view
i who was looking on an eager and curious spectator i who was watching the working of this mournful tragedy i who like a wicked angel was laughing at the evil #man# committed protected by secrecy a #secret# is easily kept by the rich and powerful i am in my #turn# bitten by the serpent whose tortuous #course# i was watching and bitten to the #heart#
complaints are unavailing be a #man# be strong be full of #hope# for i am here and #will# watch over you
see said he $m_maximilian_morrel$ groaned come come continued the #count# $m_maximilian_morrel$ shook his #head# sorrowfully
i tell you to #hope# do you understand me cried $m_de_monte_cristo$ remember that i never uttered a falsehood and am never deceived
it is twelve clock $m_maximilian_morrel$ #thank# heaven that you came at noon rather than in the #evening# or #tomorrow# #morning# listen $m_maximilian_morrel$
it is noon if $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ is not now dead she #will# not die how so cried $m_maximilian_morrel$ when i left her dying
$m_de_monte_cristo$ pressed his #hand# to his #forehead# what was passing in that brain so loaded with dreadful #secret# what does the angel of #light# or the angel of #darkness# say to that #mind# at once implacable and generous
god only knows $m_de_monte_cristo$ raised his #head# once more and this #time# he was calm as a #child# awaking from its sleep
i command you not to stir attempt #nothing# not to let your #countenance# betray a #thought# and i #will# send you tidings
$m_maximilian_morrel$ said he #return# home go oh #count# you overwhelm me with that coolness have you then #power# against #death#
are you superhuman are you an angel and the young #man# who had never shrunk from danger shrank before $m_de_monte_cristo$ with indescribable #terror#
but $m_de_monte_cristo$ looked at him with so melancholy and sweet a #smile# that $m_maximilian_morrel$ felt the #tear# filling his #eye#
i can do much for you my #friend# replied the #count# go i must be alone $m_maximilian_morrel$ subdued by the extraordinary ascendancy
$m_de_monte_cristo$ exercised over #everything# around him did not endeavor to resist it he pressed the #count# #hand# and left he stopped #one# #moment# at the #door# for $monsieur_baptistin$ whom he saw in the rue matignon and who was running
meanwhile $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and avrigny had made all possible haste $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival and the #doctor# examined the invalid with all the #care# the #circumstance# demanded and with an #interest# which the knowledge of the #secret# intensified twofold
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ closely watching his #countenance# and his #lip# awaited the result of the examination $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ paler than even the young #girl# more eager than $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ for the decision was watching also intently and affectionately
at last avrigny slowly uttered these #word# she is still alive still cried $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ oh #doctor# what a dreadful #word# is that
yes said the physician i repeat it she is still alive and i am astonished at it
but is she safe asked the #father# yes since she #life# at that #moment# avrigny #glance# met $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #eye#
he placed the young #girl# again on the #chair# her #lip# were scarcely discernible they were so pale and white as well as
it glistened with such extraordinary #joy# so rich and full of #thought# that the physician was struck her whole #face# and remained motionless looking at $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who appeared to anticipate and commend all he did
#sir# said avrigny to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ call $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ maid if you please $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ went himself to find her and avrigny approached $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
have you #something# to tell me asked he the old #man# winked his #eye# expressively which we may remember was his only #way# of expressing his approval
privately yes well i #will# remain with you at this #moment# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ returned followed by the #lady# maid and after her came #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
what is the #matter# then with this dear #child# she has just left me and she complained of being indisposed but i did not think seriously of it
the young #woman# with #tear# in her #eye# and every mark of affection of a true #mother# approached $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and took her #hand#
$m_d_avrigny$ continued to #look# at $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ he saw the #eye# of the old #man# dilate and become round his cheeks #turn# pale and tremble the perspiration stood in drops upon his #forehead#
ah said he involuntarily following $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #eye# which were fixed on #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who repeated this poor #child# would be better in #bed#
$m_d_avrigny$ who saw that would be a #mean# of his remaining alone with $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ expressed his #opinion# that it was the best #thing# that could be done but he forbade that #anything# should be given to her except what he ordered
they carried $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ away she had revived but could scarcely move or speak so shaken was her frame by the attack
she had however just #power# to give #one# parting #look# to her #grandfather# who in losing her seemed to be resigning his very soul
$m_d_avrigny$ followed the invalid wrote a prescription ordered $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ to take a cabriolet go in #person# to a chemist to get the prescribed medicine bring it himself and wait for him in his #daughter# #room#
then having renewed his injunction not to give $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #anything# he went down again to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ shut the #door# carefully and after convincing himself that no #one# was listening
come fanny we #will# put her to #bed# do you said he know #anything# of this young #lady# illness
yes said the old #man# we have no #time# to lose i #will# #question# and do you #answer# me
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ made a #sign# that he was ready to #answer# did you anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter
yes avrigny reflected a #moment# then approaching $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ pardon what i am going to say added he but no indication should be neglected in this terrible situation
did you see poor $barrois$ die $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ raised his #eye# to heaven do you know of what he died asked avrigny placing his #hand# on $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #shoulder#
yes replied the old #man# do you think he died a natural #death# a #sort# of #smile# was discernible on the motionless #lip# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
then you have #thought# that $barrois$ was poisoned yes do you think the #poison# he fell a victim to was intended for him
no do you think the same #hand# which unintentionally struck $barrois$ has now attacked $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ yes
then #will# she die too asked avrigny fixing his penetrating gaze on $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ he watched the #effect# of this #question# on the old #man#
no replied he with an #air# of triumph which would have puzzled the most clever diviner then you #hope# said avrigny with surprise
yes what do you #hope# the old #man# made him understand with his #eye# that he could not #answer#
ah yes it is true murmured avrigny then turning to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ do you #hope# the assassin #will# be tried no
then you #hope# the #poison# #will# take no #effect# on $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ yes it is no news to you added avrigny to tell you that an attempt has been made to #poison# her
the old #man# made a #sign# that he entertained no #doubt# upon the #subject# then how do you #hope# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #will# escape
$m_d_avrigny$ followed the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle containing the mixture which he took every #morning#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ kept his #eye# steadfastly fixed on the same #spot# ah indeed said avrigny struck with a sudden #thought# has it occurred to you $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ did not let him finish
yes said he to prepare her system to resist #poison# yes by accustoming her by degrees
yes yes yes said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ delighted to be understood of #course# i had told you that there was brucine in the mixture i give you
yes and by accustoming her to that #poison# you have endeavored to neutralize the #effect# of a similar #poison#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #joy# continued and you have succeeded exclaimed avrigny without that precaution $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ would have died before assistance could have been procured
the dose has been excessive but she has only been shaken by it and this #time# at any rate $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #will# not die
a superhuman #joy# expanded the old #man# #eye# which were raised towards heaven with an #expression# of infinite gratitude
at this #moment# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ returned here #doctor# said he is what you sent me for was this prepared in your #presence#
$m_d_avrigny$ took the bottle poured some drops of the mixture it contained in the hollow of his #hand# and swallowed them
well said he let us go to $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ i #will# give instructions to #everyone# and you $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #will# yourself see that no #one# deviates from them
yes replied the #procureur# have you not let it go out of your #hand# no m
at the #moment# when avrigny was returning to $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #room# accompanied by $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ an italian #priest# of serious demeanor and calm and firm #tone# hired for his #use# the $house_of_peers$ adjoining the hotel of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
about two #hour# afterwards its foundation was reported to be unsafe but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing himself there with his modest furniture the same #day# at five clock
the lease was drawn up for three six or nine #year# by the new tenant who according to the rule of the proprietor paid six #month# in advance
no #one# knew how the three former tenants of that $house_of_peers$ left it this new tenant who as we have said was an italian was called il signor giacomo $abbé_busoni$
workmen were immediately called in and that same #night# the passengers at the #end# of the faubourg saw with surprise that carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower #part# of the tottering $house_of_peers$
we saw in a preceding #chapter# how #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ went formally to announce to #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the approaching #marriage# of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$
this formal announcement which implied or appeared to imply the approval of all the #person# concerned in this momentous #affair# had been preceded by a #scene# to which our readers must be admitted
we beg them to take #one# #step# backward and to transport themselves the #morning# of that #day# of great catastrophes into the showy gilded salon we have before shown them and which was the pride of its owner #baron# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
in this #room# at about ten clock in the #morning# the #banker# himself had been walking to and fro for some #minute# thoughtfully and in evident uneasiness watching both #door# and listening to every #sound#
étienne said he see why $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ has asked me to meet her in the #drawing# #room# and why she makes me wait so long
having given this vent to his ill humor the #baron# became more calm $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had that #morning# requested an interview with her #father# and had fixed on the gilded #drawing# #room# as the #spot#
the singularity of this #step# and above all its formality had not a little surprised the #banker# who had immediately obeyed his #daughter# by repairing first to the #drawing# #room#
#chapter# #father# and #daughter# when his patience was exhausted he called his #valet# étienne soon returned from his errand
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #lady# maid says #sir# that $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is finishing her toilette and #will# be here shortly $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ nodded to signify that he was satisfied
this was #one# of his #part# in the popular comedy he was performing a make up he had adopted and which suited him about as well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors who seen from #one# #side# were the image of geniality and from the #other# showed #lip# drawn down in chronic ill temper
let us hasten to say that in private the genial #side# descended to the level of the #other# so that generally the indulgent #man# disappeared to give #place# to the brutal #husband# and domineering #father#
to the #world# and to his #servant# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ assumed the character of the good natured #man# and the indulgent #father# why the devil does that foolish #girl# who pretends to #wish# to speak to me not come into my #study#
he was turning this #thought# over in his brain for the twentieth #time# when the #door# opened and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ appeared attired in a figured black satin dress her #hair# dressed and gloves on as if she were going to the italian opera
and why on #earth# does she want to speak to me at all well $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ what is it you want with me
and why in this solemn #drawing# #room# when the #study# is so comfortable i quite understand why you ask #sir# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ making a #sign# that her #father# might be seated
and in #fact# your two #question# suggest fully the theme of our #conversation# i #will# #answer# them both and #contrary# to the usual method the last first because it is the least difficult
i have chosen the #drawing# #room# #sir# as our #place# of meeting in #order# to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of a #banker# #study#
those gilded cashbooks drawers locked like #gate# of fortresses heaps of bank bills come from i know not where and the quantities of #letter# from england holland spain india china and peru have generally a strange influence on a #father# #mind# and make him forget that there is in the #world# an #interest# greater and more sacred than the good #opinion# of his correspondents
i have therefore chosen this #drawing# #room# where you see smiling and happy in their magnificent frames your portrait mine my #mother# and all #sort# of rural landscapes and touching pastorals
i rely much on external impressions perhaps with regard to you they are immaterial but i should be no artist if i had not some fancies
very well replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who had listened to all this preamble with imperturbable coolness but without understanding a #word# since like every #man# burdened with #thought# of the past he was occupied with seeking the thread of his own #idea# in those of the speaker
there is then the second #point# cleared up or nearly so said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ without the least confusion and with that masculine pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language
you ask me why i have requested this interview i #will# tell you in two #word# #sir# i #will# not marry #count# $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$
and you appear satisfied with the explanation now let us #return# to the first $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ leaped from his #chair# and raised his #eye# and #arm# towards heaven
i see for since this little #affair# began i have not manifested the slightest opposition and yet i am always sure when the opportunity arrives to oppose a determined and absolute #will# to #people# who have not consulted me and
however this #time# my tranquillity or passiveness as philosophers say proceeded from another source it proceeded from a #wish# like a submissive and devoted #daughter# a slight #smile# was observable on the purple #lip# of the young #girl# to practice obedience
yes indeed #sir# continued $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ still quite calm you are astonished #thing# which displease me well asked $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
well #sir# replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i have tried to the very last and now that the #moment# has come i feel in #spite# of all my #effort# that it is impossible
but said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ whose weak #mind# was at first quite overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic marking evident premeditation and force of #will#
what is your #reason# for this refusal $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ what #reason# do you assign my #reason# replied the young #girl#
well it is not that the #man# is more ugly more foolish or more disagreeable than any #other# no $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ may appear to those who #look# at #man# #face# and figures as a very good specimen of his kind
it is not either that my #heart# is less touched by him than any #other# that would be a schoolgirl
#reason# which i consider quite beneath me i actually #love# no #one# #sir# you know it do you not
i do not then see why without real necessity i should encumber my #life# with a perpetual #companion# has not some sage said #nothing# too much and another
i have been taught these two aphorisms in latin and in greek #one# is i believe from phædrus and the #other# from bias
i carry all my #effect# with me well my dear #father# in the shipwreck of #life# for #life# is an eternal shipwreck of our #hope#
i cast into the #sea# my useless encumbrance that is all and i remain with my own #will# disposed to live perfectly alone and consequently perfectly free
murmured $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ turning pale for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so suddenly encountered
unhappy #girl# unhappy #girl# unhappy #girl# replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ unhappy #girl# do you say #sir# no indeed the exclamation appears quite theatrical and affected
happy on the #contrary# for what am i in want of the #world# calls me beautiful it is #something# to be well received
i possess a share of wit and a certain relative sensibility which enables me to draw from #life# in general for the support of mine all i meet with that is good like the monkey who cracks the nut to get at its contents
i like a favorable reception it expands the #countenance# and those around me do not then appear so ugly i am rich for you have #one# of the first #fortune# in france
i am your only #daughter# and you are not so exacting as the #father# of the porte saint martin and gaîté who disinherit their #daughter# for not giving them grandchildren
besides the provident #law# has deprived you of the #power# to disinherit me at least entirely as it has also of the #power# to compel me to marry $monsieur_cavalcanti$ this or $monsieur_cavalcanti$ that
and so being beautiful witty somewhat talented as the comic operas say and rich and that is #happiness# #sir# why do you call me unhappy
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ seeing his #daughter# smiling and proud even to insolence could not entirely repress his brutal #feeling# but they betrayed themselves only by an exclamation
under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him from under those beautiful black eyebrows he prudently turned away and calmed himself immediately daunted by the #power# of a resolute #mind#
you are all you boast of being excepting #one# #thing# i #will# not too hastily tell you which but would rather leave you to guess it
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ looked at $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ much surprised that #one# flower of her crown of pride with which she had so superbly decked herself should be disputed
you have perfectly explained to me the sentiments which influence a #girl# like you who is determined she #will# not marry now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a #father# like me who has decided that his #daughter# shall marry
truly my #daughter# replied he with a #smile# my #daughter# continued the #banker# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ bowed not as a submissive #daughter# but as an adversary prepared for a discussion
my #daughter# continued $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ when a #father# asks his #daughter# to choose a #husband# he has always some #reason# for wishing her to marry
some are affected with the mania of which you spoke just now that of living again in their grandchildren this is not my weakness i tell you at once #family# #joy# have no charm for me
i may acknowledge this to a #daughter# whom i know to be philosophical enough to understand my indifference and not to impute it to me as a #crime#
this is not to the #purpose# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ let us speak candidly #sir# i admire candor oh said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
i can when #circumstance# render it desirable adopt your system although it may not be my general practice i #will# therefore proceed
indeed i did not think of you in the least at the #moment# you admire candor and #will# now be satisfied i #hope# but because it suited me to marry you as soon as possible on #account# of certain commercial speculations i am desirous of entering into
i have proposed to you to marry not for your sake for $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ became uneasy it is just as i tell you
i do not willingly enter into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you who #fear# to enter my #study# lest she should imbibe disagreeable or anti poetic impressions and sensations
but in that same #banker# #study# where you very willingly presented yourself #yesterday# to ask for the thousand #franc# i give you monthly for #pocket# #money# you must know my dear young #lady# that many #thing# may be learned useful even to a #girl# who #will# not marry
there #one# may learn for instance what out of regard to your nervous susceptibility i #will# inform you of in the #drawing# #room# namely that the credit of a #banker# is his physical and moral #life# that credit sustains him as breath animates the #body# and de $m_de_monte_cristo$ once gave me a lecture on that #subject# which i have never forgotten
there we may learn that as credit sinks the #body# becomes a corpse and this is what must happen very soon to the #banker# who is proud to own so good a logician as you for his #daughter#
i assure you and you must not be angry with me for you have sought this disclosure but $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ instead of stooping drew herself up under the blow
exactly my #daughter# that is precisely what i #mean# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ almost digging his nails into his breast while he preserved on his harsh #feature# the #smile# of the heartless though clever #man# ruined
ruined said she yes that is it ah said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ yes ruined now it is revealed this #secret# so full of horror as the tragic poet says
now my #daughter# learn from my #lip# how you may alleviate this #misfortune# so far as it #will# affect you
you are a bad physiognomist if you imagine i deplore on my own #account# the catastrophe of which you warn me
oh cried $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i ruined and what #will# that signify to me have i not my talent left can i not like pasta malibran grisi acquire for myself what you would never have given me
whatever might have been your #fortune# a hundred or a hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum for which i shall be indebted to no #one# but myself and which instead of being given as you gave me those poor twelve thousand #franc# with sour #look# and reproaches for my prodigality #will# be accompanied with acclamations with bravos and with flowers
and if i do not possess that talent which your #smile# prove to me you #doubt# should i not still have that ardent #love# of independence which #will# be a substitute for wealth and which in my #mind# supersedes even the instinct of self preservation
no i grieve not on my own #account# i shall always find a resource my books my pencils my piano all the #thing# which cost but little and which i shall be able to procure #will# remain my own
undeceive yourself again either i am greatly mistaken or she has provided against the catastrophe which threatens you and which #will# pass over without affecting her
do you think that i sorrow for #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ she has taken #care# for herself at least i #hope# so for her #attention# has not been diverted from her projects by watching over me
oh no #sir# from my childhood i have seen too much and understood too much of what has passed around me for #misfortune# to have an undue #power# over me
she has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my #love# for #liberty# from my earliest recollections i have been beloved by no #one# so much
the worse that has naturally led me to #love# no #one# so much the better now you have my profession of faith
then said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ pale with anger which was not at all due to offended paternal #love# then $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ you persist in your determination to accelerate my ruin
your ruin i accelerate your ruin what do you #mean# i do not understand you so much the better i have a ray of #hope# left listen
i am all #attention# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ looking so earnestly at her #father# that it was an #effort# for the latter to endure her unrelenting gaze
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ continued $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is about to marry you and #will# #place# in my #hand# his #fortune# amounting to three #million# livres
that is admirable said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with sovereign contempt smoothing her gloves out #one# upon the #other#
you think i shall deprive you of those three #million# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ but do not #fear# it they are destined to produce at least ten
i and a #brother# #banker# have obtained a grant of a railway the only industrial enterprise which in these #day# #promise# to make good the fabulous prospects that #law# once held out to the eternally deluded parisians in the fantastic mississippi scheme
as i #look# at it a millionth #part# of a railway is worth fully as much as an acre of waste land on the banks of the ohio
we make in our #case# a deposit on a mortgage which is an advance as you see since we gain at least ten fifteen twenty or a hundred livres worth of #iron# in exchange for our #money#
well within a week i am to deposit four #million# for my share the four #million# i #promise# you #will# produce ten or twelve
but during my #visit# to you the #day# before #yesterday# #sir# which you appear to recollect so well replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i saw you arranging a deposit is not that the term of five #million# and a #half# you even pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury and you were astonished that so valuable a #paper# did not dazzle my #eye# like lightning
yes but those five #million# and a #half# are not mine and are only a #proof# of the great confidence placed in me my title of popular #banker# has gained me the confidence of charitable institutions and the five #million# and a #half# belong to them at any #other# #time# i should not have hesitated to make #use# of them but the great losses i have recently sustained are well known and as i told you my credit is rather shaken
that deposit may be at any #moment# withdrawn and if i had employed it for another #purpose# i should bring on me a disgraceful bankruptcy
i do not despise bankruptcies believe me but they must be those which enrich not those which ruin
now if you marry $monsieur_cavalcanti$ and i get the three #million# or even if it is #thought# i am going to get them my credit #will# be restored and my #fortune# which for the last #month# or two has been swallowed up in gulfs which have been opened in my path by an inconceivable fatality #will# revive
do you understand me perfectly you pledge me for three #million# do you not the greater the amount the more flattering it is to you it gives you an #idea# of your value
#one# #word# more #sir# do you #promise# me to make what #use# you can of the report of the #fortune# $monsieur_cavalcanti$ #will# bring without touching the #money#
#thank# you this is no act of selfishness but of delicacy i am willing to help rebuild your #fortune# but i #will# not be an accomplice in the ruin of #other#
but since i tell you cried $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ that with these three #million# do you expect to recover your #position# #sir# without touching those three #million#
i #hope# so if the #marriage# should take #place# and confirm my credit shall you be able to pay $monsieur_cavalcanti$ the five hundred thousand #franc# you #promise# for my dowry
he shall receive them on returning from the mayor very well what next what more do you want
i #wish# to know if in demanding my signature you leave me entirely free in my #person# absolutely
then as i said before #sir# very well i am ready to marry $monsieur_cavalcanti$ but what are you up to
ah that is my #affair# what advantage should i have over you if knowing your #secret# i were to tell you mine
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ bit his #lip# then said he you are ready to pay the official #visit# which are absolutely indispensable
yes replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and to #sign# the contract in three #day# yes then in my #turn# i also say very well
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ pressed his #daughter# #hand# in his but extraordinary to relate the #father# did not say #thank# you my #child# nor did the #daughter# #smile# at her #father#
five #minute# afterwards the piano resounded to the touch of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ armilly #finger# and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was singing brabantio malediction on desdemona
at the #end# of the #piece# étienne entered and announced to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ that the #horse# were to the #carriage# and that the #baroness# was waiting for her to pay her #visit#
is the conference ended asked $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ rising $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ motioned that he had #nothing# more to say we have seen them at $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ they proceeded then on their #course#
the contract three #day# after the #scene# we have just described namely towards five clock in the afternoon of the #day# fixed for the signature of the contract between $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ whom the #banker# persisted in calling prince a fresh breeze was stirring the leaves in the little #garden# in front of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ $house_of_peers$ and the #count# was preparing to go out
while his #horse# were impatiently pawing the #ground# held in by the coachman who had been seated a #quarter# of an #hour# on his #box# the elegant phaeton with which we are familiar rapidly turned the angle of the entrance #gate# and cast out on the doorsteps $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ as decked up and gay as if he were going to marry a princess
he inquired after the #count# with his usual familiarity and ascending lightly to the first #story# met him at the top of the stairs
volume five m #chapter# the #count# stopped on seeing the young #man# as for $andrea_rondolo$ he was launched and when he was once launched #nothing# stopped him
ah good #morning# my dear #count# said he ah $andrea_rondolo$ said the latter with his #half# jesting #tone# how do you do
i am come to talk to you about a thousand #thing# but first tell me were you going out or just returned
then in #order# not to hinder you i #will# get up with you if you please in your #carriage# and tom shall follow with my phaeton in tow
no said the #count# with an imperceptible #smile# of contempt for he had no #wish# to be seen in the young #man# society no i prefer listening to you here my dear $andrea_rondolo$ we can chat better in #door# and there is no coachman to overhear our #conversation#
the #count# returned to a small #drawing# #room# on the first #floor# sat down and crossing his legs motioned to the young #man# to take a #seat# also
charmingly as you see i was going out #sir# $andrea_rondolo$ assumed his gayest #manner#
you know my dear #count# said he the ceremony is to take #place# this #evening# at nine clock the contract is to be signed at my #father# in #law#
ah indeed said $m_de_monte_cristo$ what is it news to you has not $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ informed you of the ceremony
oh yes said the #count# i received a #letter# from him #yesterday# but i do not think the #hour# was mentioned
you are fortunate $monsieur_cavalcanti$ it is a most suitable alliance you are contracting and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is a handsome #girl#
possibly my #father# in #law# trusted to its general notoriety well said $m_de_monte_cristo$ yes indeed she is replied $monsieur_cavalcanti$ in a very modest #tone#
above all she is very rich at least i believe so said $m_de_monte_cristo$ very rich do you think replied the young #man#
doubtless it is said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ conceals at least #half# of his #fortune# and he acknowledges fifteen or twenty #million# said $andrea_rondolo$ with a #look# sparkling with #joy#
without reckoning added $m_de_monte_cristo$ that he is on the eve of entering into a #sort# of speculation already in vogue in the united states and in england but quite novel in france
yes yes i know what you #mean# the railway of which he has obtained the grant is it not
precisely it is generally believed he #will# gain ten #million# by that #affair# ten #million# do you think so
without reckoning replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ that all his #fortune# #will# come to you and justly too since $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is an only #daughter#
it is magnificent said $monsieur_cavalcanti$ who was quite confounded at the metallic #sound# of these golden #word# besides your own #fortune# as your #father# assured me is almost equal to that of your betrothed
but enough of #money# #matter# do you know $andrea_rondolo$ i think you have managed this #affair# rather skilfully not badly by any #mean# said the young #man#
i was born for a diplomatist well you must become a diplomatist diplomacy you know is #something# that is not to be acquired it is instinctive
indeed i #fear# it replied $andrea_rondolo$ in the #tone# in which he had heard dorante or valère reply to alceste at the théâtre français
have you lost your #heart# is your #love# returned i suppose so said $andrea_rondolo$ with a triumphant #smile# since i am accepted
but i must not forget #one# grand #point# which that i have been singularly assisted nonsense
i have indeed by #circumstance# no by you by me not at all prince said $m_de_monte_cristo$ laying a marked stress on the title
what have i done for you are not your #name# your social #position# and your merit sufficient no said $andrea_rondolo$ no
i maintain that the #position# of a #man# like you has done more than my #name# my social #position# and my merit
you are completely mistaken #sir# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ coldly who felt the perfidious manœuvre of the young #man# and understood the bearing of his #word# you only acquired my protection after the influence and #fortune# of your #father# had been ascertained for after all who procured for me who had never seen either you or your illustrious #father# the #pleasure# of your acquaintance two of my good #friend# $lord_wilmore$ and the $abbé_busoni$
what encouraged me not to become your surety but to patronize you your #father# #name# so well known in italy and so highly honored
this calm #tone# and perfect ease made $andrea_rondolo$ feel that he was for the #moment# restrained by a more muscular #hand# than his own and that the restraint could not be easily broken through
it is useless for you to say so #count# personally i do not know you oh then my #father# has really a very large #fortune#
#count# it appears so #sir# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ do you know if the #marriage# settlement he promised me has come
i have been advised of it but the three #million# the three #million# are probably on the #road#
then i shall really have them oh well said the #count# i do not think you have yet known the want of #money#
then arousing from his reverie now #sir# i have #one# request to make to you which you #will# understand even if it should be disagreeable to you
i have formed an acquaintance #thank# to my good #fortune# with many noted #person# and have at least for the #moment# a crowd of #friend#
but marrying as i am about to do before all paris i ought to be supported by an illustrious #name# and in the absence of the paternal #hand# some powerful #one# ought to lead me to the altar now my #father# is not coming to paris is he
$andrea_rondolo$ was so surprised that he pondered the #matter# for a #moment# proceed said $m_de_monte_cristo$
he is old covered with wounds and suffers dreadfully he says in travelling i understand well i am come to ask a favor of you
of me yes of you and pray what may it be well to take his #part#
what after the varied relations i have had the #happiness# to sustain towards you can it be that you know me so little as to ask such a #thing#
ask me to lend you #half# a #million# and although such a loan is somewhat rare on my #honor# you would annoy me less
know then what i #thought# i had already told you that in participation in this #world# #affair# more especially in their moral aspects the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ has never ceased to entertain the scruples and even the superstitions of the east
ah my dear #sir# i who have a seraglio at cairo #one# at smyrna and #one# at constantinople preside at a wedding never
then you refuse me decidedly and were you my #son# or my #brother# i would refuse you in the same #way#
but what must be done said $andrea_rondolo$ disappointed you said just now that you had a hundred #friend#
very true but you introduced me at $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ not at all let us recall the exact #fact#
you met him at a #dinner# party at my $house_of_peers$ and you introduced yourself at his $house_of_peers$ that is a totally different #affair#
yes but by my #marriage# you have forwarded that i not in the least i beg you to believe
recollect what i told you when you asked me to propose you oh i never make matches my dear prince it is my settled principle
$andrea_rondolo$ bit his #lip# but at least you #will# be there #will# all paris be there
oh certainly well like all paris i shall be there too said the #count# and #will# you #sign# the contract
i see no objection to that my scruples do not go thus far well since you #will# grant me no more i must be content with what you give me
but #one# #word# more #count# what is it advice be careful advice is worse than a #service#
oh you can give me this without compromising yourself tell me what it is is my #wife#
#fortune# five hundred thousand livres that is the #sum# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ himself announced must i receive it or leave it in the #hand# of the #notary#
this is the #way# such #affair# are generally arranged when it is wished to do them stylishly your two solicitors appoint a meeting when the contract is signed for the next or the following #day# then they exchange the two portions for which they each give a receipt then when the #marriage# is celebrated they #place# the amount at your disposal as the chief member of the alliance
i #thought# i heard my #father# in #law# say that he intended embarking our property in that famous railway #affair# of which you spoke just now
because said $andrea_rondolo$ with a certain ill concealed uneasiness well replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ it #will# be the #way# everybody says of trebling your #fortune# in twelve #month#
#baron# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is a good #father# and knows how to calculate in that #case# said $andrea_rondolo$ #everything# is all #right# excepting your refusal which quite grieves me
you must attribute it only to natural scruples under similar #circumstance# well said $andrea_rondolo$ let it be as you #wish#
notwithstanding a slight resistance on the #part# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ whose #lip# turned pale but who preserved his ceremonious #smile# $andrea_rondolo$ seized the #count# #hand# pressed it jumped into his phaeton and disappeared
the four or five remaining #hour# before nine clock arrived $andrea_rondolo$ employed in riding paying #visit# designed to induce those of whom he had spoken to appear at the #banker# in their gayest equipages dazzling them by #promise# of shares in schemes which have since turned every brain and in which $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was just taking the initiative
in #fact# at #half# past eight in the #evening# the grand salon the gallery adjoining and the three #other# #drawing# #room# on the same #floor# were filled with a perfumed crowd who sympathized but little in the #event# but who all participated in that #love# of being present wherever there is #anything# fresh to be seen
an academician would say that the entertainments of the fashionable #world# are collections of flowers which attract inconstant butterflies famished bees and buzzing drones
no #one# could deny that the #room# were splendidly illuminated the #light# streamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings and all the bad taste of decorations which had only their richness to boast of shone in its splendor
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was dressed with elegant simplicity in a figured white silk dress and a white rose #half# concealed in her jet black #hair#
this #evening# then at nine clock adieu till then was her only ornament unaccompanied by a single jewel
her #eye# however betrayed that perfect confidence which contradicted the girlish simplicity of this modest attire #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was chatting at a short #distance# with $m_lucien_debray$ $m_beauchamp$ and $baron_de_château_renaud$
$m_lucien_debray$ was admitted to the $house_of_peers$ for this grand ceremony but on the same plane with #everyone# else and without any particular privilege
m $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ surrounded by deputies and #man# connected with the revenue was explaining a new theory of taxation which he intended to adopt when the #course# of #event# had compelled the government to call him into the ministry
$andrea_rondolo$ on whose #arm# hung #one# of the most consummate dandies of the opera was explaining to him rather cleverly since he was obliged to be bold to appear at ease his future projects and the new luxuries he meant to introduce to parisian fashions with his hundred and seventy five thousand livres per annum
the crowd moved to and fro in the #room# like an ebb and flow of turquoises rubies emeralds opals and #diamond#
if there was a beautiful lily or a sweet rose you had to search for it concealed in some #corner# behind a #mother# with a turban or an aunt with a bird of paradise
at each #moment# in the midst of the crowd the buzzing and the laughter the #door# keeper #voice# was heard announcing some #name# well known in the financial department respected in the army or illustrious in the literary #world# and which was acknowledged by a slight movement in the different groups
but for #one# whose privilege it was to agitate that ocean of human waves how many were received with a #look# of indifference or a sneer of disdain
at the #moment# when the #hand# of the massive #time# #piece# representing endymion asleep pointed to nine on its golden #face# and the hammer the faithful type of mechanical #thought# struck nine #time# the #name# of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ resounded in its #turn# and as if by an electric shock all the assembly turned towards the #door#
the #count# was dressed in black and with his habitual simplicity his white waistcoat displayed his expansive noble chest and his black stock was singularly noticeable because of its contrast with the deadly paleness of his #face#
as usual the oldest #woman# were the most decorated and the ugliest the most conspicuous his only jewellery was a chain so fine that the slender #gold# thread was scarcely perceptible on his white waistcoat
the #count# perceived at #one# #glance# #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ at #one# #end# of the #drawing# #room# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ at the #other# and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ in front of him
he first advanced towards the #baroness# who was chatting with #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who had come alone $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ being still an invalid and without turning aside so clear was the #road# left for him he passed from the #baroness# to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ whom he complimented in such rapid and measured terms that the proud artist was quite struck
near her was $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ armilly who thanked the #count# for the #letter# of introduction he had so kindly given her for italy which she intended immediately to make #use# of
a circle was immediately formed around the #door# on leaving these #lady# he found himself with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who had advanced to meet him
having accomplished these three social #duty# $m_de_monte_cristo$ stopped looking around him with that #expression# peculiar to a certain class which seems to say i have done my #duty# now let #other# do theirs
$andrea_rondolo$ who was in an adjoining #room# had shared in the sensation caused by the arrival of $m_de_monte_cristo$ and now came forward to pay his respects to the #count#
he found him completely surrounded all were eager to speak to him as is always the #case# with those whose #word# are few and weighty
the solicitors arrived at this #moment# and arranged their scrawled #paper# on the velvet cloth embroidered with #gold# which covered the #table# prepared for the signature it was a gilt #table# supported on lions claws
#one# of the #notary# sat down the #other# remained standing they were about to proceed to the reading of the contract which #half# paris assembled was to #sign#
all took their #place# or rather the #lady# formed a circle while the #gentleman# more indifferent to the restraints of what boileau calls the style énergique commented on the feverish agitation of $andrea_rondolo$ on $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ riveted #attention# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ composure and the #light# and sprightly #manner# in which the #baroness# treated this important #affair#
but as soon as it was finished the buzz was redoubled through all the #drawing# #room# the brilliant #sum# the rolling #million# which were to be at the command of the two young #people# and which crowned the display of the wedding presents and the young #lady# #diamond# which had been made in a #room# entirely appropriated for that #purpose# had exercised to the full their delusions over the envious assembly
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ charms were heightened in the #opinion# of the young #man# and for the #moment# seemed to outvie the sun in splendor
as for the #lady# it is needless to say that while they coveted the #million# they #thought# they did not need them for themselves as they were beautiful enough without them
the contract was read during a profound #silence# $andrea_rondolo$ surrounded by his #friend# complimented flattered beginning to believe in the reality of his #dream# was almost bewildered
the #notary# solemnly took the pen flourished it above his #head# and said #gentleman# we are about to #sign# the contract
the #baron# was to #sign# first then the representative of $monsieur_cavalcanti$ senior then the #baroness# afterwards the future couple as they are styled in the abominable phraseology of legal documents
the #baron# took the pen and signed then the representative the #baroness# approached leaning on #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #arm#
an unexpected incident in the #affair# of murder and theft at the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ in which he nearly fell a victim deprives us of the #pleasure# of seeing $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
my dear said she as she took the pen is it not vexatious indeed said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ in the same #tone# in which he would have said
oh well what do i #care# as a #matter# of #fact# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ approaching i am much afraid that i am the involuntary cause of his absence
what you #count# said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ signing if you are take #care# for i shall never forgive you
$andrea_rondolo$ pricked up his ears but it is not my fault as i shall endeavor to prove #everyone# listened eagerly
you remember said the #count# during the most profound #silence# that the unhappy wretch who came to rob me died at my $house_of_peers$ the supposition is that he was stabbed by his accomplice on attempting to leave it
in #order# that his wounds might be examined he was undressed and his clothes were thrown into a #corner# where the #police# picked them up with the exception of the waistcoat which they overlooked
$andrea_rondolo$ turned pale and drew towards the #door# he saw a cloud rising in the horizon which appeared to forebode a coming storm
$m_de_monte_cristo$ who so rarely opened his #lip# was about to speak yes said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
well this waistcoat was discovered #today# covered with #blood# and with a hole over the #heart# the #lady# screamed and two or three prepared to faint
no #one# could guess what the dirty rag could be i alone suspected that it was the waistcoat of the murdered #man#
my #valet# in examining this mournful relic felt a #paper# in the #pocket# and drew it out it was a #letter# addressed to you #baron#
yes indeed to you i succeeded in deciphering your #name# under the #blood# with which the #letter# was stained replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ amid the general outburst of amazement
it was brought to me to me cried $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ but asked #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ looking at her #husband# with uneasiness how could that prevent $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
in this simple #way# #madame# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ the waistcoat and the #letter# were both what is termed circumstantial evidence i therefore sent them to the #king# attorney
you understand my dear #baron# that legal methods are the safest in criminal #case# it was perhaps some plot against you
$andrea_rondolo$ looked steadily at $m_de_monte_cristo$ and disappeared in the second #drawing# #room# possibly said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was not this murdered #man# an old galley slave
yes replied the #count# a felon named $m_caderousse$ $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ turned slightly pale $andrea_rondolo$ reached the anteroom beyond the little #drawing# #room#
i perceive that my #story# has caused a general #emotion# and i beg to apologize to you #baroness# and to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
but go on signing said $m_de_monte_cristo$ the #baroness# who had signed returned the pen to the #notary#
$andrea_rondolo$ andrea repeated several young #people# who were already on sufficiently intimate terms with him to call him by his christian #name#
prince $monsieur_cavalcanti$ said the latter prince $monsieur_cavalcanti$ where are you call the prince inform him that it is his #turn# to #sign# cried $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to #one# of the floorkeepers
but at the same #instant# the crowd of #guest# rushed in alarm into the principal salon as if some frightful monster had entered the #apartment# quærens quem devoret
an #officer# was placing two #soldier# at the #door# of each #drawing# #room# and was advancing towards $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ preceded by a commissary of #police# girded with his scarf
there was indeed #reason# to retreat to be alarmed and to scream #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ uttered a scream and fainted $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who #thought# himself threatened certain consciences are never calm $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ even before his #guest# showed a #countenance# of abject #terror#
what is the #matter# #sir# asked $m_de_monte_cristo$ advancing to meet the commissioner which of you #gentleman# asked the #magistrate# without replying to the #count# #answer# to the #name# of $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$
a #cry# of #astonishment# was heard from all #part# of the #room# they searched they questioned but who then is $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$
asked $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ in amazement a galley slave escaped from confinement at toulon and what #crime# has he committed
he is accused said the commissary with his inflexible #voice# of having assassinated the #man# named $m_caderousse$ his former #companion# in #prison# at the #moment# he was making his escape from the $house_of_peers$ of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
the departure for belgium a few #minute# after the #scene# of confusion produced in the salons of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ by the unexpected #appearance# of the brigade of #soldier# and by the disclosure which had followed the mansion was deserted with as much rapidity as if a #case# of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out among the #guest#
in a few #minute# through all the #door# down all the #staircase# by every exit #everyone# hastened to retire or rather to fly for it was a situation where the ordinary condolences which even the best #friend# are so eager to offer in great catastrophes were seen to be utterly futile
$house_of_peers$ only $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ closeted in his #study# and making his statement to the #officer# of gendarmes #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ terrified in the boudoir with which we are acquainted and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who with haughty #air# and disdainful #lip# had retired to her #room# with her inseparable #companion# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ armilly
as for the numerous #servant# more numerous that #evening# than usual for their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the café de paris venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the insult to which they had been subjected they collected in groups in the hall in the kitchens or in their #room# thinking very little of their #duty# which was thus naturally interrupted
$m_de_monte_cristo$ cast a rapid #glance# around him $andrea_rondolo$ was gone #chapter# there remained in the #banker# of all this household only two #person# deserve our notice these are $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ armilly
the betrothed had retired as we said with haughty #air# disdainful #lip# and the demeanor of an outraged queen followed by her #companion# who was paler and more disturbed than herself
on reaching her #room# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ locked her #door# while $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ fell on a #chair# ah what a dreadful #thing# said the young musician who would have suspected it
m $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ a murderer a galley slave escaped a convict an ironical #smile# curled the #lip# of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ in #truth# i was fated said she
i escaped the $m_albert_de_morcerf$ only to fall into the $monsieur_cavalcanti$ oh do not confound the two $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
hold your tongue the #man# are all infamous and i am happy to be able now to do more than detest
them i despise them what shall we do asked $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ what shall we do yes
why the same we had intended doing three #day# since set off what although you are not now going to be married you intend still
what i have always wished for desired and coveted is the #life# of an artist free and independent relying only on my own resources and accountable only to myself
what for that they may try a #month# hence to marry me again and to whom $m_lucien_debray$ perhaps as it was once proposed
listen $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ i hate this #life# of the fashionable #world# always ordered measured ruled like our music #paper# remain here no $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ no
this #evening# adventure #will# serve for my excuse i did not seek #one# i did not ask for #one# god sends me this and i hail it joyfully
how strong and courageous you are said the fair frail #girl# to her brunette #companion# did you not yet know me
come $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ let us talk of our #affair# the post chaise was happily bought three #day# since have you had it sent where we are to go for it
and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with her usual precision opened a printed #paper# and read léon armilly twenty #year# of #age# profession artist #hair# black #eye# black travelling with his sister
yes our passport here it is capital how did you get this passport
when i went to ask de $m_de_monte_cristo$ for #letter# to the directors of the theatres at rome and naples i expressed my #fear# of travelling as a #woman# he perfectly understood them and undertook to procure for me a #man# passport and two #day# after i received this to which i have added with my own #hand#
we have then only to pack up our trunks we shall start the #evening# of the signing of the contract instead of the #evening# of the wedding that is all
travelling with his sister well said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ cheerfully but consider the #matter# seriously $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
i am tired of hearing only of market reports of the #end# of the #month# of the rise and fall of spanish funds of haitian bonds
oh i am done with considering instead of that $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ do you understand #air# #liberty# melody of birds plains of lombardy venetian canals roman palaces the bay of naples
the young #girl# to whom this #question# was addressed drew from an inlaid secretaire a small portfolio with a lock in which she counted twenty three bank #note#
how much have we $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ twenty three thousand #franc# said she and as much at least in pearls #diamond# and jewels said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
with forty five thousand #franc# we can live like princesses for two #year# and comfortably for four but before six #month# you with your music and i with my #voice#
come you shall take charge of the #money# i of the jewel #box# so that if #one# of us had the #misfortune# to lose her #treasure# the #other# would still have hers left
we are rich we shall double our capital now the portmanteau let us make haste the portmanteau stop said $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ going to listen at #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #door#
what do you #fear# that we may be discovered the #door# is locked they may tell us to open it
they may if they like but we #will# not you are a perfect amazon $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and the two young #girl# began to heap into a trunk all the #thing# they #thought# they should require
there now said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ while i change my #costume# do you lock the portmanteau $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ pressed with all the #strength# of her little #hand# on the top of the portmanteau
but i cannot said she i am not strong enough do you shut it ah you do well to ask said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ laughing
and the young #girl# kneeling on the top pressed the two #part# of the portmanteau together and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ armilly passed the bolt of the padlock through
when this was done $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ opened a drawer of which she kept the key and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak
i forgot that i was hercules and you only the pale omphale here said she you see i have #thought# of #everything# with this cloak you #will# not be cold
but you oh i am never cold you know besides with these #man# clothes #will# you dress here
certainly shall you have #time# do not be uneasy you little coward all our #servant# are busy discussing the grand #affair#
besides what is there astonishing when you think of the #grief# i ought to be in that i shut myself up tell me
from the same drawer she took a #man# complete #costume# from the boots to the coat and a provision of linen where there was #nothing# superfluous but every requisite
then with a promptitude which indicated that this was not the first #time# she had amused herself by adopting the garb of the opposite sex $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ drew on the boots and pantaloons tied her cravat buttoned her waistcoat up to the throat and put on a coat which admirably fitted her beautiful figure
indeed it is very good said $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ looking at her with admiration but that beautiful black #hair# those magnificent braids which made all the #lady# sigh with envy #will#
no truly you comfort me come and help me oh that is very good they go under a #man#
and with her left #hand# seizing the thick mass which her long #finger# could scarcely grasp she took in her #right# #hand# a pair of long scissors and soon the steel met through the rich and splendid #hair# which fell in a cluster at her #foot# as she leaned back to keep it from her coat
then she grasped the front #hair# which she also cut off without expressing the least regret on the #contrary# her #eye# sparkled with greater #pleasure# than usual under her ebony eyebrows
hat like the #one# i see down there you shall see said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ oh the magnificent #hair# said $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ with regret
and am i not a hundred #time# better thus cried $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ smoothing the scattered curls of her #hair# which had now quite a masculine #appearance#
and do you not think me handsomer so oh you are beautiful always beautiful cried $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ now where are you going
to brussels if you like it is the nearest frontier we can go to brussels liège aix la chapelle then up the rhine to strasbourg
we #will# cross switzerland and go down into italy by the saint gothard #will# that do yes what are you looking at
i am looking at you indeed you are adorable like that #one# would say you were carrying me off
and the two young #girl# whom #everyone# might have #thought# plunged in #grief# the #one# on her own #account# the #other# from #interest# in her #friend# burst out laughing as they cleared away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally accompanied the preparations for their escape
then having blown out the #light# the two fugitives looking and listening eagerly with outstretched necks opened the #door# of a dressing #room# which led by a #side# #staircase# down to the yard $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ going first and holding with #one# #arm# the portmanteau which by the opposite handle $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ armilly scarcely raised with both #hand#
and they would be #right# $pardieu$ oh i think you swore $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ the yard was empty the clock was striking twelve
the porter was not yet gone to #bed# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ approached softly and saw the old #man# sleeping soundly in an armchair in his lodge
she returned to $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ took up the portmanteau which she had placed for a #moment# on the #ground# and they reached the archway under the #shadow# of the #wall#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ concealed $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ in an angle of the gateway so that if the porter chanced to awake he might see but
then placing herself in the full #light# of the lamp which lit the yard #gate# cried she with her finest contralto #voice# and rapping at the #window#
the porter got up as $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ expected and even advanced some #step# to recognize the #person# who was going out but seeing a young #man# striking his boot impatiently with his riding whip he opened it immediately
#one# #person# $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ slid through the #half# open #gate# like a snake and bounded lightly forward $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ apparently calm although in all probability her #heart# beat somewhat faster than usual went out in her #turn#
a porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau then the two young #girl# having told him to take it to no rue de la victoire walked behind this #man# whose #presence# comforted $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ ordered the porter to put down the portmanteau gave him some #piece# of #money# and having rapped at the shutter sent him away
the shutter where $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had rapped was that of a little laundress who had been previously warned and was not yet gone to #bed#
as for $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ she was as strong as a judith or a delilah they arrived at the appointed #spot# she opened the #door#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ let the porter get the post chaise from the coach $house_of_peers$ and fetch some post #horse# from the hotel here are five #franc# for his trouble
indeed said $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ i admire you and i could almost say respect you the laundress looked on in #astonishment# but as she had been promised twenty $louis_xviii$ she made no remark
in a #quarter# of an #hour# the porter returned with a post #boy# and #horse# which were harnessed and put in the post chaise in a #minute# while the porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and strap
here is the passport said the postilion which #way# are we going young #gentleman# to fontainebleau replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with an almost masculine #voice#
i am giving them the slip said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ this #woman# to whom we have given twenty $louis_xviii$ may betray us for forty we #will# soon alter our direction
what do you say said $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ and the young #girl# jumped into the britzka which was admirably arranged for sleeping in without scarcely touching the #step#
a #quarter# of an #hour# afterwards the postilion having been put in the #right# #road# passed with a crack of his whip through the gateway of the barrière saint martin
you are always #right# said the music teacher seating herself by the #side# of her #friend# ah said $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$ breathing freely here we are out of paris
yes my dear the abduction is an accomplished #fact# replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ yes and without violence said $mademoiselle_louise_d_armilly$
i shall bring that forward as an extenuating #circumstance# replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ these #word# were lost in the #noise# which the #carriage# made in rolling over the pavement of la villette
and now let us leave $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and her #friend# pursuing their #way# to brussels and #return# to poor $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ so inopportunely interrupted in his rise to #fortune#
m $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ no longer had a #daughter# #chapter# the bell and bottle tavern notwithstanding his youth #master# $andrea_rondolo$ was a very skilful and intelligent #boy#
we have seen that on the first rumor which reached the salon he had gradually approached the #door# and crossing two or three #room# at last disappeared
but we have forgotten to mention #one# #circumstance# which nevertheless ought not to be omitted in #one# of the #room# he crossed the trousseau of the bride elect was on exhibition
there were caskets of #diamond# cashmere shawls valenciennes lace english veils and in #fact# all the tempting #thing# the bare mention of which makes the #heart# of young #girl# bound with #joy# and which is called the corbeille
now in passing through this #room# $andrea_rondolo$ proved himself not only to be clever and intelligent but also provident for he helped himself to the most valuable of the ornaments before him
furnished with this plunder $andrea_rondolo$ leaped with a lighter #heart# from the #window# intending to slip through the #hand# of the gendarmes
tall and well proportioned as an ancient gladiator and muscular as a spartan he walked for a #quarter# of an #hour# without knowing where to direct his #step# actuated by the sole #idea# of getting away from the #spot# where if he lingered he knew that he would surely be taken
having passed through the rue du mont blanc guided by the instinct which leads thieves always to take the safest path he found himself at the #end# of the rue la fayette
he was quite alone on #one# #side# was the vast wilderness of the saint lazare on the #other# paris enshrouded in #darkness#
there he stopped breathless and panting am i to be captured he cried no not if i can #use# more activity than my #enemy#
my safety is now a mere #question# of speed at this #moment# he saw a cab at the top of the faubourg poissonnière
the dull driver smoking his pipe was plodding along toward the limits of the faubourg saint denis where no #doubt# he ordinarily had his station
ho #friend# said $m_benedetto$ what do you want #sir# asked the driver is your #horse# tired
four wretched fares and twenty sous over making in all seven #franc# are all that i have earned and i ought to take ten to the owner
tired oh yes tired enough he has done #nothing# the whole of this blessed #day# #will# you add these twenty #franc# to the seven you have
with #pleasure# #sir# twenty #franc# are not to be despised tell me what i am to do for this
a very easy #thing# if your #horse# isnt tired i tell you he ll go like the wind only tell me which #way# to drive
towards the louvres ah i know the #way# you get good sweetened rum over there
exactly so i merely #wish# to overtake #one# of my #friend# with whom i am going to hunt #tomorrow# at chapelle en serval
he should have waited for me here with a cabriolet till #half# past eleven it is twelve and tired of waiting he must have gone on
it is likely well #will# you try and overtake him #nothing# i should like better
if you do not overtake him before we reach bourget you shall have twenty #franc# if not before louvres thirty
and if we do overtake him forty said $andrea_rondolo$ after a #moment# hesitation at the #end# of which he remembered that he might safely #promise#
$andrea_rondolo$ got into the cab which passed rapidly through the faubourg saint denis along the faubourg saint martin crossed the barrier and threaded its #way# through the interminable villette
they never overtook the chimerical #friend# yet $andrea_rondolo$ frequently inquired of #people# on #foot# whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed for a green cabriolet and bay #horse# and as there are a great many cabriolets to be seen on the #road# to the low #country# and as nine tenths of them are green the inquiries increased at every #step#
#everyone# had just seen it pass it was only five hundred two hundred #one# hundred #step# in advance at #length# they reached it but it was not the #friend#
that all #right# said the #man# hop in and we re off who o pla once the cab was also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two post #horse#
ah said $monsieur_cavalcanti$ to himself if i only had that britzka those two good post #horse# and above all the passport that carries them on
and he sighed deeply the calash contained $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ armilly hurry hurry said $andrea_rondolo$ we must overtake him soon
and the poor #horse# resumed the desperate gallop it had kept up since leaving the barrier and arrived steaming at louvres
certainly said $andrea_rondolo$ i shall not overtake my #friend# but i shall kill your #horse# therefore i had better stop
here are thirty #franc# i #will# sleep at the cheval rouge and #will# secure a #place# in the first coach
good #night# #friend# and $andrea_rondolo$ after placing six #piece# of five #franc# each in the #man# #hand# leaped lightly on to the pathway
$andrea_rondolo$ pretended to go towards the hotel of the cheval rouge but after leaning an #instant# against the #door# and hearing the last #sound# of the cab which was disappearing from view he went on his #road# and with a lusty stride soon traversed the space of two leagues
the cabman joyfully pocketed the #sum# and turned back on his #road# to paris then he rested he must be near chapelle en serval where he pretended to be going
it would be impossible to make #use# of a diligence equally so to engage post #horse# to travel either #way# a passport was necessary
it was still more impossible to remain in the department of the oise #one# of the most open and strictly guarded in france this was quite out of the #question# especially to a #man# like $andrea_rondolo$ perfectly conversant with criminal #matter#
it was not fatigue that stayed $andrea_rondolo$ here it was that he might form some resolution adopt some #plan# he sat down by the #side# of the moat buried his #face# in his #hand# and reflected
he threw some dust over the topcoat which he had found #time# to unhook from the antechamber and button over his ball #costume# and going to chapelle en serval
ten #minute# after he raised his #head# his resolution was made he knocked loudly at the #door# of the only inn in the #place#
my #friend# said $andrea_rondolo$ i was coming from mortefontaine to senlis when my #horse# which is a troublesome creature stumbled and threw me
the host opened i must reach compiègne tonight or i shall cause deep anxiety to my #family# could you let me hire a #horse# of you
the host called the stable #boy# and ordered him to saddle le blanc then he awoke his #son# a #child# of seven #year# whom he ordered to ride before the #gentleman# and bring back the #horse#
an innkeeper has always a #horse# to let whether it be good or bad $andrea_rondolo$ gave the innkeeper twenty #franc# and in taking them from his #pocket# dropped a visiting card
this belonged to #one# of his #friend# at the café de paris so that the innkeeper picking it up after $andrea_rondolo$ had left was convinced that he had let his #horse# to the #count# of mauléon rue saint dominique that being the #name# and address on the card
le blanc was not a fast animal but he kept up an easy steady pace in three #hour# and a #half# $andrea_rondolo$ had traversed the nine leagues which separated him from compiègne and four clock struck as he reached the #place# where the coaches stop
$andrea_rondolo$ who had often stayed there in his rides about paris recollected the bell and bottle inn he turned around saw the #sign# by the #light# of a reflected lamp and having dismissed the #child# giving him all the small coin he had about him he began knocking at the #door# very reasonably concluding that having now three or four #hour# before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow by a #sound# sleep and a good supper
there is an excellent tavern at compiègne well remembered by those who have ever been there a waiter opened the #door#
i have been dining at saint jean aux bois and expected to catch the coach which passes by at midnight but like a fool i have lost my #way# and have been walking for the last four #hour# in the forest
show me into #one# of those pretty little #room# which overlook the #court# and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of bordeaux
the waiter had no suspicions $andrea_rondolo$ spoke with perfect composure he had a cigar in his mouth and his #hand# in the #pocket# of his top coat his clothes were fashionably made his chin smooth his boots irreproachable he looked merely as if he had stayed out very late that was all
while the waiter was preparing his #room# the hostess arose $andrea_rondolo$ assumed his most charming #smile# and asked if he could have no which he had occupied on his last stay at compiègne
my #friend# said $andrea_rondolo$ unfortunately no was engaged by a young #man# who was travelling with his sister
$andrea_rondolo$ appeared in #despair# but consoled himself when the hostess assured him that no prepared for him was situated precisely the same as no and while warming his #foot# and chatting about the last races at chantilly he waited until they announced his #room# to be ready
$andrea_rondolo$ had not spoken without cause of the pretty #room# looking out upon the #court# of the bell hotel which with its triple galleries like those of a theatre with the jessamine and clematis twining round the #light# columns forms #one# of the prettiest entrances to an inn that you can imagine
the fowl was tender the wine old the #fire# clear and sparkling and $andrea_rondolo$ was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite as though #nothing# had happened
then he went to #bed# and almost immediately fell into that deep sleep which is sure to #visit# #man# of twenty #year# of #age# even when they are torn with remorse
now here we are obliged to own that $andrea_rondolo$ ought to have felt remorse but that he did not this was the #plan# which had appealed to him to afford the best #chance# of his security
before daybreak he would awake leave the inn after rigorously paying his bill and reaching the forest he would under pretence of making #study# in painting test the hospitality of some peasants procure himself the dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet casting off the lion skin to assume that of the woodman then with his #hand# covered with dirt his #hair# darkened by #mean# of a leaden comb his complexion embrowned with a preparation for which #one# of his old comrades had given him the recipe he intended by following the wooded districts to reach the nearest frontier walking by #night# and sleeping in the #day# in the forests and quarries and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from #time# to #time#
once past the frontier $andrea_rondolo$ proposed making #money# of his #diamond# and by uniting the proceeds to ten bank #note# he always carried about with him in #case# of accident he would then find himself possessor of about livres which he philosophically considered as no very deplorable condition after all
moreover he reckoned much on the #interest# of the $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to hush up the rumor of their own misadventures these were the #reason# which added to the fatigue caused $andrea_rondolo$ to sleep so soundly
in #order# that he might wake early he did not close the shutters but contented himself with bolting the #door# and placing on the #table# an unclasped and long pointed knife whose temper he well knew and which was never absent from him
about seven in the #morning# $andrea_rondolo$ was awakened by a ray of sunlight which played warm and brilliant upon his #face#
in all well organized brains the predominating #idea# and there always is #one# is sure to be the last #thought# before sleeping and the first upon waking in the #morning#
$andrea_rondolo$ had scarcely opened his #eye# when his predominating #idea# presented itself and whispered in his ear that he had slept too long
a gendarme is #one# of the most striking objects in the #world# even to a #man# void of uneasiness but for #one# who has a timid conscience and with good cause too the yellow blue and white uniform is really very alarming
he jumped out of #bed# and ran to the #window# a gendarme was crossing the #court# why is that gendarme there
then all at once he replied with that logic which the reader has doubtless remarked in him there is #nothing# astonishing in seeing a gendarme at an inn instead of being astonished let me dress myself
and the youth dressed himself with a facility his #valet# de chambre had failed to rob him of during the two #month# of fashionable #life# he had led in paris
asked $andrea_rondolo$ of himself now then said $andrea_rondolo$ while dressing himself i ll wait till he leaves and then i ll slip away m
$andrea_rondolo$ who had now put on his boots and cravat stole gently to the #window# and a second #time# lifted up the muslin curtain
not only was the first gendarme still there but the young #man# now perceived a second yellow blue and white uniform at the #foot# of the #staircase# the only #one# by which he could descend while a third on horseback holding a musket in his fist was posted as a sentinel at the great #street# #door# which alone afforded the #mean# of egress
the #appearance# of the third gendarme settled the #matter# for a crowd of curious loungers was extended before him effectually blocking the entrance to the hotel
and saying this they re after me was $andrea_rondolo$ first #thought# diable a pallor overspread the young #man# #forehead# and he looked around him with anxiety
his #room# like all those on the same #floor# had but #one# outlet to the gallery in the #sight# of everybody
i am lost was his second #thought# and indeed for a #man# in $andrea_rondolo$ situation an arrest meant the assizes trial and #death# #death# without mercy or delay
for a #moment# he convulsively pressed his #head# within his #hand# and during that brief period he became nearly mad with #terror# but soon a ray of #hope# glimmered in the multitude of #thought# which bewildered his #mind# and a faint #smile# played upon his white #lip# and pallid cheeks
he looked around and saw the objects of his search upon the chimney #piece# they were a pen ink and #paper#
with forced composure he dipped the pen in the ink and wrote the following #line# upon a sheet of #paper#
i have no #money# to pay my bill but i am not a dishonest #man# i leave behind me as a pledge this pin worth ten #time# the amount
i shall be excused for leaving at daybreak for i was ashamed he then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the #paper#
this done instead of leaving the #door# fastened he drew back the bolts and even placed the #door# ajar as though he had left the #room# forgetting to close it and slipping into the chimney like a #man# accustomed to that kind of gymnastic exercise after replacing the chimney #board# which represented achilles with deidamia and effacing the very marks of his #foot# upon the ashes he commenced climbing the hollow tunnel which afforded him the only #mean# of escape left
at this precise #time# the first gendarme $andrea_rondolo$ had noticed walked upstairs preceded by the commissary of #police# and supported by the second gendarme who guarded the #staircase# and was himself reinforced by the #one# stationed at the #door#
at daybreak the telegraphs were set at #work# in all directions and almost immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost endeavors to arrest the murderer of $m_caderousse$
compiègne that royal residence and fortified town is well furnished with authorities gendarmes and commissaries of #police# they therefore began operations as soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived and the bell and bottle being the best known hotel in the town they had naturally directed their first inquiries there
now besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the hôtel de ville which is next #door# to the bell and bottle it had been stated by #other# that a number of #traveller# had arrived during the #night#
the sentinel who was relieved at six clock in the #morning# remembered perfectly that just as he was taking his post a few #minute# past four a young #man# arrived on horseback with a little #boy# before him
the young #man# having dismissed the #boy# and #horse# knocked at the #door# of the hotel which was opened and again closed after his entrance
this late arrival had attracted much suspicion and the young #man# being no #other# than $andrea_rondolo$ the commissary and gendarme who was a brigadier directed their #step# towards his #room#
$andrea_rondolo$ was indebted for this #visit# to the following #circumstance# they found the #door# ajar oh oh said the brigadier who thoroughly understood the trick a bad #sign# to find the #door# open
i would rather find it triply bolted and indeed the little #note# and pin upon the #table# confirmed or rather corroborated
the sad #truth# $andrea_rondolo$ had fled we say corroborated because the brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single #proof#
$andrea_rondolo$ had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his #foot# in the ashes but still it was an outlet and in this #light# was not to be passed over without serious investigation
he glanced around looked in the #bed# shook the curtains opened the closets and finally stopped at the chimney the brigadier sent for some sticks and straw and having filled the chimney with them set a #light# to it
the #fire# crackled and the smoke ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano but still no #prisoner# fell down as they expected
the #fact# was that $andrea_rondolo$ at war with society ever since his youth was quite as deep as a gendarme even though he were advanced to the rank of brigadier and quite prepared for the #fire# he had climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the chimney pots
at #one# #time# he #thought# he was saved for he heard the brigadier exclaim in a loud #voice# to the two gendarmes
but venturing to peep he perceived that the latter instead of retiring as might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement were watching with increased #attention#
it was now his #turn# to #look# about him the hôtel de ville a massive sixteenth century building was on his #right# #anyone# could descend from the #opening# in the tower and examine every #corner# of the roof below and $andrea_rondolo$ expected momentarily to see the #head# of a gendarme appear at #one# of these #opening#
if once discovered he knew he would be lost for the roof afforded no #chance# of escape he therefore resolved to descend not through the same chimney by which he had come up but by a similar #one# conducting to another #room#
he looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued and having reached it he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by #anyone#
at the same #minute# #one# of the little #window# of the hôtel de ville was thrown open and the #head# of a gendarme appeared
for an #instant# it remained motionless as #one# of the #stone# decorations of the building then after a long sigh of disappointment the #head# disappeared
the brigadier calm and dignified as the #law# he represented passed through the crowd without answering the thousand #question# addressed to him and re entered the hotel
well my #boy# said the brigadier the brigand must really have escaped early this #morning# but we #will# send to the villers coterets and noyon #road# and search the forest when we shall catch him no #doubt#
the honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus in that intonation which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie when a loud scream accompanied by the violent ringing of a bell resounded through the #court# of the hotel
he is not here well asked the two gendarmes ah what is that cried the brigadier
some #traveller# seems impatient said the host what number was it that rang number run waiter
aha said the brigadier stopping the #servant# the #person# who is ringing appears to want #something# more than amwaiter we #will# attend upon him with a gendarme
the little #fellow# who arrived last #night# in a post chaise with his sister and who asked for an #apartment# with two #bed#
at this #moment# the screams and ringing were redoubled who occupies number the bell here rang for the third #time# with another shriek of anguish
follow me mr commissary said the brigadier tread in my #step# wait an #instant# said the host number has two #staircase# inside and outside
good said the brigadier i #will# take charge of the inside #one# are the carbines loaded yes brigadier
well you guard the exterior and if he attempts to fly #fire# upon him he must be a great criminal from what the telegraph says
the brigadier followed by the commissary disappeared by the inside #staircase# accompanied by the #noise# which his assertions respecting $andrea_rondolo$ had excited in the crowd
this is what had happened $andrea_rondolo$ had very cleverly managed to descend two thirds of the chimney but then his #foot# slipped and notwithstanding his endeavors he came into the #room# with more speed and #noise# than he intended
two #lady# sleeping in #one# #bed# were awakened by the #noise# and fixing their #eye# upon the #spot# whence the #sound# proceeded they saw a #man#
#one# of these #lady# the fair #one# uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the $house_of_peers$ while the #other# rushing to the bell rope rang with all her #strength#
it would have signified little had the #room# been empty but unfortunately it was occupied $andrea_rondolo$ as we can see was surrounded by #misfortune#
for #pity# sake he cried pale and bewildered without seeing whom he was addressing for #pity# sake do not call assistance
save me i #will# not harm you $andrea_rondolo$ the murderer cried #one# of the #lady# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ exclaimed $andrea_rondolo$ stupefied
help help cried $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ armilly taking the bell from her #companion# #hand# and ringing it yet more violently
save me i am pursued said $andrea_rondolo$ clasping his #hand# for #pity# for mercy sake do not deliver me up
it is too late they are coming said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ well conceal me somewhere you can say you were needlessly alarmed you can #turn# their suspicions and save my #life#
the two #lady# pressing closely to #one# another and #drawing# the bedclothes tightly around them remained silent to this supplicating #voice# repugnance and #fear# taking #possession# of their #mind#
at #length# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #return# by the same #road# you came and we #will# say #nothing# about you unhappy wretch
well be it so here he is here he is cried a #voice# from the landing here he is
i see him the brigadier had put his #eye# to the keyhole and had discovered $andrea_rondolo$ in a posture of entreaty
a violent blow from the butt #end# of the musket burst open the lock two more forced out the bolts and the broken #door# fell in
$andrea_rondolo$ ran to the #other# #door# leading to the gallery ready to rush out but he was stopped short and he stood with his #body# a little thrown back pale and with the useless knife in his clenched #hand#
or kill yourself said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ in a #tone# which a vestal in the amphitheatre would have used when urging the victorious gladiator to finish his vanquished adversary
fly then cried $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ armilly whose #pity# returned as her #fear# diminished fly $andrea_rondolo$ shuddered and looked on the young #girl# with an #expression# which proved how little he understood such ferocious #honor#
kill myself he cried throwing down his knife why should i do so why you said answered $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ that you would be condemned to die like the worst criminals
bah said $monsieur_cavalcanti$ crossing his #arm# #one# has #friend# the brigadier advanced to him sword in #hand# come come said $andrea_rondolo$
sheathe your sword my fine #fellow# there is no occasion to make such a fuss since i give myself up and he held out his #hand# to be manacled
the two #girl# looked with horror upon this shameful metamorphosis the #man# of the #world# shaking off his covering and appearing as a galley slave
$andrea_rondolo$ turned towards them and with an impertinent #smile# asked have you any message for your #father# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ for in all probability i shall #return# to paris
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ covered her #face# with her #hand# oh oh said $andrea_rondolo$ you need not be ashamed even though you did post after me
and with this raillery $andrea_rondolo$ went out leaving the two #girl# a prey to their own #feeling# of shame and to the comments of the crowd
the #gate# of the hotel had been closed to screen them from #sight# but they were forced when the #door# was open to pass through a throng of curious #glance# and whispering #voice#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ closed her #eye# but though she could not see she could hear and the sneers of the crowd reached her in the #carriage#
was i not nearly your #husband# an #hour# after they stepped into their calash both dressed in feminine attire
she exclaimed throwing herself into the #arm# of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ armilly her #eye# sparkling with the same kind of rage which made nero #wish# that the roman #world# had but #one# neck that he might sever it at a single blow
oh why is not the #world# a wilderness the next #day# they stopped at the hôtel de flandre at brussels the same #evening# $andrea_rondolo$ was incarcerated in the conciergerie
the #law# we have seen how quietly $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ armilly accomplished their transformation and flight the #fact# being that #everyone# was too much occupied in his or her own #affair# to think of theirs
we #will# leave the #banker# contemplating the enormous magnitude of his debt before the phantom of bankruptcy and follow the #baroness# who after being momentarily crushed under the weight of the blow which had struck her had gone to seek her usual adviser $m_lucien_debray$
the #baroness# had looked forward to this #marriage# as a #mean# of ridding her of a guardianship which over a #girl# of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ character could not fail to be rather a troublesome undertaking for in the tacit relations which maintain the bond of #family# union the #mother# to maintain her ascendancy over her #daughter# must never fail to be a model of wisdom and a type of perfection
now #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ feared $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ sagacity and the influence of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ armilly she had frequently observed the contemptuous #expression# with which her #daughter# looked upon $m_lucien_debray$ an #expression# which seemed to imply that she understood all her #mother# amorous and pecuniary relationships with the intimate secretary moreover she saw that $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ detested $m_lucien_debray$ not only because he was a source of dissension and scandal under the paternal roof but because she had at once classed him in that catalogue of bipeds whom plato endeavors to withdraw from the appellation of #man# and whom diogenes designated as animals upon two legs without feathers
unfortunately in this #world# of ours each #person# views #thing# through a certain medium and so is prevented from seeing in the same #light# as #other# and #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ therefore very much regretted that the #marriage# of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had not taken #place# not only because the match was good and likely to insure the #happiness# of her #child# but because it would also set her at #liberty#
she ran therefore to $m_lucien_debray$ who after having like the #rest# of paris witnessed the contract #scene# and the scandal attending it had retired in haste to his club where he was chatting with some #friend# upon the #event# which served as a #subject# of #conversation# for three fourths of that city known as the capital of the #world#
at the precise #time# when #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ dressed in black and concealed in a long veil was ascending the stairs leading to $m_lucien_debray$ #apartment# notwithstanding the assurances of the concierge that the young #man# was not at home $m_lucien_debray$ was occupied in repelling the insinuations of a #friend# who tried to persuade him that after the terrible #scene# which had just taken #place# he ought as a #friend# of the #family# to marry $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and her two #million#
$m_lucien_debray$ did not defend himself very warmly for the #idea# had sometimes crossed his #mind# still when he recollected the independent proud spirit of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ he positively rejected it as utterly impossible though the same #thought# again continually recurred and found a resting #place# in his #heart#
tea play and the #conversation# which had become interesting during the discussion of such serious #affair# lasted till #one# clock in the #morning#
meanwhile #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ veiled and uneasy awaited the #return# of $m_lucien_debray$ in the little green #room# seated between two baskets of flowers which she had that #morning# sent and which it must be confessed $m_lucien_debray$ had himself arranged and watered with so much #care# that his absence was #half# excused in the #eye# of the poor #woman#
#chapter# at twenty #minute# to twelve #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ tired of waiting returned home #woman# of a certain grade are like prosperous grisettes in #one# respect they seldom #return# home after twelve clock
the #baroness# returned to the hotel with as much caution as $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ used in leaving it she ran lightly upstairs and with an aching #heart# entered her #apartment# contiguous as we know to that of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
she was fearful of exciting any remark and believed firmly in her #daughter# innocence and fidelity to the paternal roof she listened at $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #door# and hearing no #sound# tried to enter but the bolts were in #place#
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ then concluded that the young #girl# had been overcome with the terrible excitement of the #evening# and had gone to #bed# and to sleep
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said the maid retired to her #apartment# with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ armilly they then took tea together after which they desired me to leave saying that they needed me no longer
since then the maid had been below and like #everyone# else she #thought# the young #lady# were in their own #room# #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ therefore went to #bed# without a #shadow# of suspicion and began to muse over the recent #event#
in proportion as her memory became clearer the occurrences of the #evening# were revealed in their true #light# what she had taken for confusion was a tumult what she had regarded as #something# distressing was in reality a disgrace
and then the #baroness# remembered that she had felt no #pity# for poor $mercédès$ who had been afflicted with as severe a blow through her #husband# and #son#
she called the maid and questioned her $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ she said to herself is lost and so are we
the #affair# as it #will# be reported #will# cover us with shame for in a society such as ours satire inflicts a painful and incurable wound
and her #glance# was turned towards heaven where a mysterious providence disposes all #thing# and out of a fault nay even a vice sometimes produces a blessing
how fortunate that $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is possessed of that strange character which has so often made me tremble and then her #thought# cleaving through space like a bird in the #air# rested on $monsieur_cavalcanti$
this $andrea_rondolo$ was a wretch a robber an assassin and yet his #manner# showed the #effect# of a #sort# of education if not a complete #one# he had been presented to the #world# with the #appearance# of an immense #fortune# supported by an honorable #name#
how could she extricate herself from this labyrinth to whom would she apply to help her out of this painful situation
$m_lucien_debray$ to whom she had run with the first instinct of a #woman# towards the #man# she loves and who yet betrays her $m_lucien_debray$ could but give her advice she must apply to someone more powerful than he
the #baroness# then #thought# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ it was $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who had remorselessly brought #misfortune# into her #family# as though they had been #stranger#
but no on reflection the #procureur# was not a merciless #man# and it was not the #magistrate# slave to his #duty# but the #friend# the loyal #friend# who roughly but firmly cut into the very core of the corruption it was not the executioner but the surgeon who wished to withdraw the #honor# of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ from ignominious association with the disgraced young #man# they had presented to the #world# as their #son# in #law#
and since $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the #friend# of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had acted in this #way# no #one# could suppose that he had been previously acquainted with or had lent himself to any of $andrea_rondolo$ intrigues
but the inflexibility of the #procureur# should stop there she would see him the next #day# and if she could not make him fail in his #duty# as a #magistrate# she would at least obtain all the indulgence he could allow
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ conduct therefore upon reflection appeared to the #baroness# as if shaped for their mutual advantage she would invoke the past recall old recollections she would supplicate him by the remembrance of guilty yet happy #day#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ would stifle the #affair# he had only to #turn# his #eye# on #one# #side# and allow $andrea_rondolo$ to fly and follow up the #crime# under that #shadow# of guilt called contempt of #court#
at nine clock next #morning# she arose and without ringing for her maid or giving the least #sign# of her activity she dressed herself in the same simple style as on the previous #night# then running downstairs she left the hotel walked to the rue de provence called a cab and drove to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ $house_of_peers$
and after this reasoning she slept easily for the last #month# this wretched $house_of_peers$ had presented the gloomy #appearance# of a lazaretto infected with the plague
some of the #apartment# were closed within and without the shutters were only opened to admit a #minute# #air# showing the scared #face# of a footman and immediately afterwards the #window# would be closed like a gravestone falling on a sepulchre and the neighbors would say to each #other# in a low #voice#
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ involuntarily shuddered at the desolate aspect of the mansion descending from the cab she approached the #door# with trembling knees and rang the bell
three #time# did the bell ring with a dull heavy #sound# seeming to participate in the general sadness before the concierge appeared and peeped through the #door# which he opened just wide enough to allow his #word# to be heard
#will# there be another funeral #today# at the #procureur# $house_of_peers$ he saw a #lady# a fashionable elegantly dressed #lady# and yet the #door# remained almost closed
do you intend #opening# the #door# said the #baroness# first #madame# who are you who am i
you know me well enough we no longer know #anyone# #madame# you must be mad my #friend# said the #baroness#
where do you come from oh this is too much #madame# these are my #order# excuse me your #name#
the #baroness# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ you have seen me twenty #time# possibly #madame# and now what do you want
#madame# this is precaution not impertinence no #one# enters here without an #order# from $m_d_avrigny$ or without speaking to the #procureur#
oh how extraordinary i shall complain to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ of the impertinence of his #servant#
well i have #business# with the #procureur# is it pressing #business# you can imagine so since i have not even brought my #carriage# out yet
but enough of this here is my card take it to your #master# #madame# #will# await my #return# yes go
she had not long to wait directly afterwards the #door# was opened wide enough to admit her and when she had passed through it was again shut
without losing #sight# of her for an #instant# the concierge took a whistle from his #pocket# as soon as they entered the #court# and blew it
the concierge closed the #door# leaving #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ in the #street# the #valet# de chambre appeared on the #door# #step#
you #will# excuse this poor #fellow# #madame# he said as he preceded the #baroness# but his #order# are precise and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ begged me to tell you that he could not act otherwise
the #baroness# ascended the #step# she felt herself strongly infected with the sadness which seemed to magnify her own and still guided by the #valet# de chambre who never lost #sight# of her for an #instant# she was introduced to the #magistrate# #study#
preoccupied as #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had been with the object of her #visit# the treatment she had received from these underlings appeared to her so insulting that she began by complaining of it
but $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ raising his #head# bowed down by #grief# looked up at her with so sad a #smile# that her complaints died upon her #lip#
in the #court# showing his merchandise was a tradesman who had been admitted with the same precautions forgive my #servant# he said for a #terror# i cannot blame them for from being suspected they have become suspicious
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had often heard of the #terror# to which the #magistrate# alluded but without the evidence of her own eyesight she could never have believed that the sentiment had been carried so far
you too then are unhappy she said yes #madame# replied the #magistrate# then you #pity# me
sincerely #madame# and you understand what brings me here you #wish# to speak to me about the #circumstance# which has just happened
yes #sir# a fearful #misfortune# you #mean# a mischance a mischance repeated the #baroness#
alas #madame# said the #procureur# with his imperturbable calmness of #manner# i consider those alone #misfortune# which are irreparable
your #daughter# #will# be married #tomorrow# if not #today# in a week if not #tomorrow# and i do not think you can regret the intended #husband# of your #daughter#
and do you suppose this #will# be forgotten #everything# #will# be forgotten #madame# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ gazed on $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ stupefied to find him so almost insultingly calm
am i come to a #friend# she asked in a #tone# full of mournful dignity you know that you are #madame# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ whose pale cheeks became slightly flushed as he gave her the assurance
and truly this assurance carried him back to different #event# from those now occupying the #baroness# and him well then be more affectionate my dear $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ said the #baroness#
speak to me not as a #magistrate# but as a #friend# and when i am in bitter anguish of spirit do not tell me that i ought to be gay
i have within the last few #month# contracted the bad habit of thinking of my own and then i cannot help #drawing# up an egotistical parallel in my #mind#
that is the #reason# that by the #side# of my #misfortune# yours appear to me mere mischances that is why my dreadful #position# makes yours appear enviable
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ bowed when i hear #misfortune# named #madame# he said but this annoys you let us change the #subject#
you were saying #madame# i came to ask you my #friend# said the #baroness# what #will# be done with this impostor
impostor repeated $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ certainly #madame# you appear to extenuate some #case# and exaggerate #other# impostor indeed $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ or rather $m_benedetto$ is #nothing# more nor less than an assassin
#sir# i do not deny the #justice# of your correction but the more severely you #arm# yourself against that unfortunate #man# the more deeply #will# you strike our #family#
come forget him for a #moment# and instead of pursuing him let him go you are too late #madame# the #order# are issued
well should he be arrested do they think they #will# arrest him i #hope# so
if they should arrest him i know that sometimes #prison# afford #mean# of escape #will# you leave him in #prison#
the #procureur# shook his #head# at least keep him there till my #daughter# be married impossible #madame# #justice# has its formalities
what even for me said the #baroness# #half# jesting #half# in earnest for all even for myself among the #rest# replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
ah exclaimed the #baroness# without expressing the #idea# which the exclamation betrayed $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looked at her with that piercing #glance# which reads the #secret# of the #heart#
you refer to the terrible rumors spread abroad in the #world# that the #death# which have kept me in mourning for the last three #month# and from which $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ has only escaped by a miracle have not happened by natural #mean#
yes i know what you #mean# he said i was not thinking of that replied #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ quickly
yes you were thinking of it and with #justice# you could not help thinking of it and saying to yourself
you who pursue #crime# so vindictively #answer# now why are there unpunished #crime# in your dwelling the #baroness# became pale
you were saying this were you not well i own it i #will# #answer# you
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ drew his armchair nearer to #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ then resting both #hand# upon his desk he said in a #voice# more hollow than usual
there are #crime# which remain unpunished because the criminals are unknown and we might strike the innocent instead of the guilty but when the culprits are discovered $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ here extended his #hand# toward a large crucifix placed opposite to his desk when they are discovered i swear to you by all i hold most sacred that whoever they may be they shall die
now after the oath i have just taken and which i #will# keep #madame# dare you ask for mercy for that wretch
but #sir# are you sure he is as guilty as they say listen this is his description $m_benedetto$ condemned at the #age# of sixteen for five #year# to the galleys for forgery
he promised well as you see first a runaway then an assassin and who is this wretch
who can tell a vagabond a corsican has no #one# owned him no #one# his parents are unknown
but who was the #man# who brought him from lucca another rascal like himself perhaps his accomplice
the #baroness# clasped her #hand# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ she exclaimed in her softest and most captivating #manner# for heaven sake #madame# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with a firmness of #expression# not altogether free from harshness for
heaven sake do not ask pardon of me for a guilty wretch what am i the #law# has the #law# any #eye# to witness your #grief#
has the #law# ears to be melted by your sweet #voice# has the #law# a memory for all those soft recollections you endeavor to recall
no #madame# the #law# has commanded and when it commands it strikes you #will# tell me that i am a living being and not a code a #man# and not a volume
#look# at me #madame# #look# around me has mankind treated me as a #brother# have #man# loved me have they spared me
has #anyone# shown the mercy towards me that you now ask at my #hand# no #madame# they struck me always struck me
#woman# siren that you are do you persist in fixing on me that fascinating #eye# which reminds me that i ought to blush
well be it so let me blush for the faults you know and perhaps perhaps for even more than those
but having sinned myself it may be more deeply than #other# i never #rest# till i have torn the disguises from my #fellow# creatures and found out their weaknesses
i have always found them and more i repeat it with #joy# with triumph i have always found some #proof# of human perversity or error
every criminal i condemn seems to me living evidence that i am not a hideous exception to the #rest# alas alas alas all the #world# is wicked let us therefore strike at wickedness
but said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ resolving to make a last #effort# this young #man# though a murderer is an orphan abandoned by everybody
so much the worse or rather so much the better it has been so ordained that he may have none to weep his fate
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ pronounced these last #word# with a feverish rage which gave a ferocious eloquence to his #word#
but this is trampling on the weak #sir# the weakness of a murderer his dishonor reflects upon us
is not #death# in my $house_of_peers$ oh #sir# exclaimed the #baroness# you are without #pity# for #other# well then i tell you they #will# have no mercy on you
be it so said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ raising his #arm# to heaven with a threatening gesture at least delay the trial till the next assizes we shall then have six #month# before us
no #madame# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ instructions have been given there are yet five #day# left five #day# are more than i require
while working #night# and #day# i sometimes lose all recollection of the past and then i experience the same #sort# of #happiness# i can imagine the dead feel still it is better than suffering
do you not think that i also long for forgetfulness but #sir# he has fled let him escape inaction is a pardonable offence
i tell you it is too late early this #morning# the telegraph was employed and at this very #minute#
#sir# said the #valet# de chambre entering the #room# a dragoon has brought this despatch from the #minister# of the interior
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ seized the #letter# and hastily broke the seal #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ trembled with #fear# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ started with #joy# arrested
he exclaimed he was taken at compiègne and all is over #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ rose from her #seat# pale and cold
adieu #sir# she said adieu #madame# replied the #king# attorney as in an almost joyful #manner# he conducted her to the #door#
come i had a forgery three robberies and two #case# of arson i only wanted a murder and here it is
then turning to his desk he said striking the #letter# with the back of his #right# #hand# it #will# be a splendid session
bowed down with fatigue she was indeed confined to her #bed# and it was in her own #room# and from the #lip# of #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ that she heard all the strange #event# we have related
we #mean# the flight of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and the arrest of $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ or rather $m_benedetto$ together with the accusation of murder pronounced against him
#chapter# the apparition as the #procureur# had told #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was not yet recovered but $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was so weak that this recital scarcely produced the same #effect# it would have done
indeed her brain was only the #seat# of vague #idea# and confused forms mingled with strange fancies alone presented themselves before her #eye#
during the daytime $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ perceptions remained tolerably clear owing to the constant #presence# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who caused himself to be carried to his granddaughter #room# and watched her with his paternal tenderness $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ also on his #return# from the #law# #court# frequently passed an #hour# or two with his #father# and #child#
at six clock $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ retired to his #study# at eight $m_d_avrigny$ himself arrived bringing the #night# draught prepared for the young #girl# and then $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was carried away
had she been in her usual state of health a nurse of the #doctor# choice succeeded them and never left till about ten or eleven clock when $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was asleep
as she went downstairs she gave the keys of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #room# to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ so that no #one# could reach the sick #room# excepting through that of #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and little $edward$
every #morning# $m_maximilian_morrel$ called on $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ to receive news of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and extraordinary as it seemed each #day# found him less uneasy
certainly though $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ still labored under dreadful nervous excitement she was better and moreover $m_de_monte_cristo$ had told him when #half# distracted he had rushed to the #count# $house_of_peers$ that if she were not dead in two #hour# she would be saved
the nervous excitement of which we speak pursued $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ even in her sleep or rather in that state of somnolence which succeeded her waking #hour# it was then in the #silence# of #night# in the dim #light# shed from the alabaster lamp on the chimney #piece# that she saw the #shadow# pass and repass which hover over the #bed# of sickness and fan the fever with their trembling wings
first she fancied she saw her stepmother threatening her then $m_maximilian_morrel$ stretched his #arm# towards her sometimes mere #stranger# like the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ came to #visit# her even the very furniture in these #moment# of delirium seemed to move and this state lasted till about three clock in the #morning# when a deep heavy slumber overcame the young #girl# from which she did not awake till daylight
on the #evening# of the #day# on which $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had learned of the flight of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and the arrest of $m_benedetto$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ having retired as well as $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and avrigny her #thought# wandered in a confused maze alternately reviewing her own situation and the #event# she had just heard
the nurse having placed the beverage prepared by the #doctor# within reach of the patient and locked the #door# was listening with #terror# to the comments of the #servant# in the kitchen and storing her memory with all the horrible #story# which had for some #month# past amused the occupants of the antechambers in the $house_of_peers$ of the #king# attorney
now four #day# had elapsed and $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ still lived eleven clock had struck meanwhile an unexpected #scene# was passing in the #room# which had been so carefully locked
ten #minute# had elapsed since the nurse had left $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ who for the last #hour# had been suffering from the fever which returned nightly incapable of controlling her #idea# was forced to yield to the excitement which exhausted itself in producing and reproducing a succession and recurrence of the same fancies and images
the #night# lamp threw out countless rays each resolving itself into some strange form to her disordered imagination when suddenly by its flickering #light# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #thought# she saw the #door# of her library which was in the recess by the chimney #piece# open slowly though she in vain listened for the #sound# of the hinges on which it turned
at any #other# #time# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ would have seized the silken bell pull and summoned assistance but #nothing# astonished her in her present situation
her #reason# told her that all the visions she beheld were but the #child# of her imagination and the conviction was strengthened by the #fact# that in the #morning# no traces remained of the nocturnal phantoms who disappeared with the coming of daylight
from behind the #door# a human figure appeared but the #girl# was too familiar with such apparitions to be alarmed and therefore only stared hoping to recognize $m_maximilian_morrel$
the figure advanced towards the #bed# and appeared to listen with profound #attention# at this #moment# a ray of #light# glanced across the #face# of the midnight visitor
it is not he she murmured and waited in the assurance that this was but a #dream# for the #man# to disappear or assume some #other# form
she remembered that the best method of dispelling such illusions was to drink for a draught of the beverage prepared by the #doctor# to allay her fever seemed to cause a reaction of the brain and for a short #time# she suffered less
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ therefore reached her #hand# towards the #glass# but as soon as her trembling #arm# left the #bed# the apparition advanced more quickly towards her and approached the young #girl# so closely that she fancied she heard his breath and felt the pressure of his #hand#
this #time# the illusion or rather the reality surpassed #anything# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had before experienced she began to believe herself really alive and awake and the belief that her #reason# was this #time# not deceived made her shudder
still she felt her pulse and finding it throb violently the pressure she felt was evidently intended to arrest her #arm# and she slowly withdrew it
then the figure from whom she could not detach her #eye# and who appeared more protecting than menacing took the #glass# and walking towards the #night# #light# held it up as if to test its transparency
this did not seem sufficient the #man# or rather the ghost for he trod so softly that no #sound# was heard then poured out about a spoonful into the #glass# and drank it
every #minute# she had expected that it would vanish and give #place# to another vision but the #man# instead of dissolving like a #shadow# again approached her and said in an agitated #voice#
it was the first #time# #one# of these visions had ever addressed her in a living #voice# and she was about to utter an exclamation
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ witnessed this #scene# with a sentiment of stupefaction now you may drink $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ shuddered the #man# placed his #finger# on her #lip#
it was easy to see that no #doubt# now remained in the young #girl# #mind# as to the reality of the #scene# her #eye# started with #terror# her #hand# trembled and she rapidly drew the bedclothes closer to her
still the #presence# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ at such an #hour# his mysterious fanciful and extraordinary entrance into her #room# through the #wall# might well seem impossibilities to her shattered #reason#
do not call #anyone# do not be alarmed said the #count# do not let a shade of suspicion or uneasiness remain in your breast the #man# standing before you $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ for this #time# it is no ghost is #nothing# more than the tenderest #father# and the most respectful #friend# you could #dream# of
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ could not reply the #voice# which indicated the real #presence# of a being in the #room# alarmed her so much that she feared to utter a syllable still the #expression# of her #eye# seemed to inquire
the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ she murmured if your intentions are pure why are you here the #count# marvellous sagacity understood all that was passing in the young #girl# #mind#
or rather #look# upon me #look# at my #face# paler even than usual and my #eye# red with weariness for four #day#
listen to me he said i have not closed them for i have been constantly watching you to protect and preserve you for $m_maximilian_morrel$
the #blood# mounted rapidly to the cheeks of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ for the #name# just announced by the #count# dispelled all the #fear# with which his #presence# had inspired her
$m_maximilian_morrel$ she exclaimed and so sweet did the #sound# appear to her that she repeated it $m_maximilian_morrel$ has he then owned all to you
#everything# he told me your #life# was his and i have promised him that you shall live you have promised him that i shall live
yes but #sir# you spoke of vigilance and protection are you a #doctor# yes the best you could have at the present #time# believe me
but you say you have watched said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ uneasily where have you been i have not seen you the #count# extended his #hand# towards the library
i was hidden behind that #door# he said which leads into the next $house_of_peers$ which i have rented $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ turned her #eye# away and with an indignant #expression# of pride and modest #fear# exclaimed
#sir# i think you have been guilty of an unparalleled intrusion and that what you call protection is more like an insult
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ he answered during my long watch over you all i have observed has been what #people# visited you what nourishment was prepared and what beverage was served then when the latter appeared dangerous to me i entered as i have now done and substituted in the #place# of the #poison# a healthful draught which instead of producing the #death# intended caused #life# to circulate in your veins
#poison# #death# exclaimed $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #half# believing herself under the influence of some feverish hallucination what are you saying #sir#
hush my #child# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ again placing his #finger# upon her #lip# i did say #poison# and #death#
but drink some of this and the #count# took a bottle from his #pocket# containing a red liquid of which he poured a few drops into the #glass#
drink this and then take #nothing# more tonight $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ stretched out her #hand# but scarcely had she touched the #glass# when she drew back in #fear#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ took the #glass# drank #half# its contents and then presented it to $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ who smiled and swallowed the #rest#
oh yes she exclaimed i recognize the flavor of my nocturnal beverage which refreshed me so much and seemed to ease my aching brain
#thank# you #sir# #thank# you this is how you have lived during the last four #night# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said the #count#
oh the wretched #hour# i have endured the torture to which i have submitted when i saw the deadly #poison# poured into your #glass# and how i trembled lest you should drink it before i could find #time# to throw it away
#sir# said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ at the height of her #terror# you say you endured tortures when you saw the deadly #poison# poured into my #glass# but if you saw this you must also have seen the #person# who poured it
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ raised herself in #bed# and drew over her chest which appeared whiter than snow the embroidered cambric still moist with the cold dews of delirium to which were now added those of #terror#
but oh how i passed that #time# yes you saw the #person# repeated the young #girl#
yes repeated the #count# what you tell me is horrible #sir# you #wish# to make me believe #something# too dreadful
what attempt to murder me in my #father# $house_of_peers$ in my #room# on my #bed# of sickness oh leave me #sir#
you are tempting me you make me #doubt# the goodness of providence it is impossible it cannot be are you the first that this #hand# has stricken
would not $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ also have fallen a victim had not the treatment he has been pursuing for the last three #year# neutralized the #effect# of the #poison#
have you not seen de $madame_de_saint_méran$ $madame_de_saint_méran$ $barrois$ all fall oh heaven said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ is this the #reason# why grandpapa has made me share all his beverages during the last #month#
and have they all tasted of a slightly bitter flavor like that of dried orange peel oh yes yes
then that explains all said $m_de_monte_cristo$ your #grandfather# knows then that a poisoner #life# here perhaps he even suspects the #person#
he has been fortifying you his beloved #child# against the fatal #effect# of the #poison# which has failed because your system was already impregnated with it
but even this would have availed little against a more deadly medium of #death# employed four #day# ago which is generally but too fatal
but who then is this assassin this murderer let me also ask you a #question# have you never seen #anyone# enter your #room# at #night#
oh yes i have frequently seen #shadow# pass close to me approach and disappear but i took them for visions raised by my feverish imagination and indeed when you entered i #thought# i was under the influence of delirium
then you do not know who it is that attempts your #life# no said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
who could #desire# my #death# you shall know it now then said $m_de_monte_cristo$ listening how do you #mean# said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ looking anxiously around
because you are not feverish or delirious tonight but thoroughly awake midnight is striking which is the #hour# murderers choose
oh heavens exclaimed $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ wiping off the drops which ran down her #forehead# midnight struck slowly and sadly every #hour# seemed to strike with leaden weight upon the #heart# of the poor #girl#
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said the #count# summon up all your courage still the beatings of your #heart# do not let a #sound# escape you and feign to be asleep then you #will# see
good bye for the present replied the #count# walking upon tiptoe towards the library #door# and smiling with an #expression# so sad and paternal that the young #girl# #heart# was filled with gratitude
before closing the #door# he turned around once more and said not a movement not a #word# let them think you asleep or perhaps you may be killed before i have the #power# of helping you
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ seized the #count# #hand# i think i hear a #noise# she said leave me and with this fearful injunction the #count# disappeared through the #door# which noiselessly closed after him
locusta $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was alone two #other# clocks slower than that of saint philippe du roule struck the #hour# of midnight from different directions and excepting the rumbling of a few #carriage# all was silent
#chapter# then $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #attention# was engrossed by the clock in her #room# which marked the seconds she began counting them remarking that they were much slower than the beatings of her #heart# and still she doubted the
inoffensive $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ could not imagine that #anyone# should #desire# her #death# why should they to what #end# what had she done to excite the malice of an #enemy#
#one# terrible #idea# pressed upon her #mind# that someone existed in the #world# who had attempted to assassinate her and who was about to endeavor to do so again
supposing this #person# wearied at the inefficacy of the #poison# should as $m_de_monte_cristo$ intimated have recourse to steel what if the #count# should have no #time# to run to her
there was no #fear# of her falling asleep rescue what if her last #moment# were approaching and she should never again see $m_maximilian_morrel$
but through the #door# she fancied she saw the luminous #eye# of the #count# that #eye# which lived in her memory and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay his adventurous and devoted friendship
when this terrible chain of #idea# presented itself $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was nearly persuaded to ring the bell and call for help twenty #minute# twenty tedious #minute# passed thus then ten more and at last the clock struck the #half# #hour#
just then the #sound# of #finger# nails slightly grating against the #door# of the library informed $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ that the #count# was still watching and recommended her to do the same at the same #time# on the opposite #side# that is towards $edward$ #room# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ fancied that she heard the creaking of the #floor# she listened attentively holding her breath till she was nearly suffocated the lock turned and the #door# slowly opened
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had raised herself upon her elbow and had scarcely #time# to throw herself down on the #bed# and shade her #eye# with her #arm# then trembling agitated and her #heart# beating with indescribable #terror# she awaited the #event#
someone approached the #bed# and drew back the curtains $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ summoned every #effort# and breathed with that regular respiration which announces tranquil sleep
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said a low #voice# the #girl# shuddered to the #heart# but did not reply $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ repeated the same #voice#
then #everything# was still excepting that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ heard the almost noiseless #sound# of some liquid being poured into the #glass# she had just emptied
still silent $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had promised not to wake then she ventured to open her eyelids and #glance# over her extended #arm#
during this short #time# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ must have held her breath or moved in some slight degree for the #woman# disturbed stopped and leaned over the #bed# in #order# the better to ascertain whether $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ slept it was #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
she saw a #woman# in a white dressing gown pouring a liquor from a phial into her #glass# on recognizing her #step# #mother# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ could not repress a shudder which caused a vibration in the #bed#
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ instantly stepped back close to the #wall# and there shaded by the #bed# curtains she silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
the latter recollected the terrible caution of $m_de_monte_cristo$ she fancied that the #hand# not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife
then collecting all her remaining #strength# she forced herself to close her #eye# but this simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame generally so easy to accomplish became almost impossible at this #moment# so much did curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the #truth#
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ however reassured by the #silence# which was alone disturbed by the regular breathing of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ again extended her #hand# and #half# hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial into the #glass#
she only witnessed the withdrawal of the #arm# the fair round #arm# of a #woman# but twenty five #year# old and who yet spread #death# around her
it is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ during the #minute# and a #half# #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ remained in the #room#
the grating against the library #door# aroused the young #girl# from the stupor in which she was plunged and which almost amounted to insensibility
then she retired so gently that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ did not know she had left the #room# she raised her #head# with an #effort#
the noiseless #door# again turned on its hinges and the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ reappeared well said he do you still #doubt#
oh murmured the young #girl# have you seen alas did you recognize $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ groaned oh yes
she said i saw but i cannot believe would you rather die then and cause $m_maximilian_morrel$ #death#
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ the #hand# which now threatens you #will# pursue you everywhere your #servant# #will# be seduced with #gold# and #death# #will# be offered to you disguised in every shape
oh repeated the young #girl# almost bewildered can i not leave the $house_of_peers$ can i not escape you #will# find it in the #water# you drink from the spring in the fruit you pluck from the #tree#
but did you not say that my kind #grandfather# precaution had neutralized the #poison# yes but not against a strong dose the #poison# #will# be changed and the quantity increased
he took the #glass# and raised it to his #lip# it is already done he said brucine is no longer employed but a simple narcotic
i can recognize the flavor of the alcohol in which it has been dissolved if you had taken what #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ has poured into your #glass# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ valentine you would have been doomed
but exclaimed the young #girl# why am i thus pursued why are you so kind so good so unsuspicious of ill
but you are rich $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ you have livres a #year# and you prevent her #son# from enjoying these livres
that you cannot understand $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ no i have never injured her how so the #fortune# is not her gift but is inherited from my relations
certainly and that is why and $madame_de_saint_méran$ have died that is why $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was sentenced the #day# he made you his heir that is why you in your #turn# are to die
it is because your #father# would inherit your property and your #brother# his only #son# succeed to his
$edward$ poor #child# are all these #crime# committed on his #account# ah then you at #length# understand heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him
it was considered that you dead the #fortune# would naturally revert to your #brother# unless he were disinherited and besides the #crime# appearing useless it would be folly to commit it
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ you are an angel but why is my #grandfather# allowed to live and is it possible that this frightful combination of #crime# has been invented by a #woman#
do you recollect in the arbor of the hôtel des postes at perugia seeing a #man# in a brown cloak whom your stepmother was questioning upon aqua tofana
well ever since then the infernal project has been ripening in her brain ah then indeed #sir# said the sweet #girl# bathed in #tear#
no $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ for i have foreseen all their plots no your #enemy# is conquered since we know her and you #will# live $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ live to be happy yourself and to confer #happiness# upon a noble #heart# but to insure this you must rely on me
i see that i am condemned to die command me #sir# what am i to do
you must blindly take what i give you alas were it only for my own sake i should prefer to die
you must not confide in #anyone# not even in your #father# my #father# is not engaged in this fearful plot is he #sir#
no and yet your #father# a #man# accustomed to judicial accusations ought to have known that all these #death# have not happened naturally it is he who should have watched over you
asked $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ clasping her #hand# he should have occupied my #place# he should have emptied that #glass# he should have risen against the assassin
#sir# said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ i #will# do all i can to live for there are two beings who #love# me and #will# die if i die
spectre against spectre he murmured in a low #voice# as he concluded his sentence my #grandfather# and $m_maximilian_morrel$
i #will# watch over them as i have over you well #sir# do as you #will# with me and then she added in a low #voice#
oh heavens what #will# befall me whatever may happen $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ do not be alarmed though you suffer though you lose #sight# hearing consciousness #fear# #nothing#
though you should awake and be ignorant where you are still do not #fear# even though you should find yourself in a sepulchral vault or coffin
reassure yourself then and say to yourself at this #moment# a #friend# a #father# who #life# for my #happiness# and that of $m_maximilian_morrel$ watches over me
alas alas what a fearful extremity $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ would you rather denounce your stepmother i would rather die a hundred #time#
oh yes die no you #will# not die but #will# you #promise# me whatever happens that you #will# not complain but #hope#
i #will# think of $m_maximilian_morrel$ you are my own darling #child# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ i alone can save you and i #will#
she felt that the #moment# had arrived to ask for courage and began to pray and while uttering little more than incoherent #word# she forgot that her white #shoulder# had no #other# covering than her long #hair# and that the pulsations of her #heart# could be seen through the lace of her nightdress
$m_de_monte_cristo$ gently laid his #hand# on the young #girl# #arm# drew the velvet coverlet close to her throat and said with a paternal #smile#
my #child# believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness of providence and the #love# of $m_maximilian_morrel$
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ in the extremity of her #terror# joined her #hand# for $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ gave him a #look# full of gratitude and remained as docile as a #child#
then he drew from his waistcoat #pocket# the little emerald #box# raised the golden lid and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea which he placed in her #hand#
she took it and looked attentively on the #count# there was an #expression# on the #face# of her intrepid protector which commanded her veneration
she evidently interrogated him by her #look# yes said he $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ carried the pastille to her mouth and swallowed it
and now my dear #child# adieu for the present i #will# try and gain a little sleep for you are saved
$m_de_monte_cristo$ for some #time# kept his #eye# fixed on the young #girl# who gradually fell asleep yielding to the #effect# of the narcotic the #count# had given her
then he took the #glass# emptied three #part# of the contents in the fireplace that it might be supposed $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had taken it and replaced it on the #table# then he disappeared after throwing a farewell #glance# on $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ who slept with the confidence and innocence of an angel at the #foot# of the lord
the #night# #light# continued to burn on the chimney #piece# exhausting the last drops of oil which floated on the surface of the #water#
the globe of the lamp appeared of a reddish hue and the flame brightening before it expired threw out the last flickerings which in an inanimate object have been so often compared with the convulsions of a human creature in its final agonies
go said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ whatever happens i #promise# you not to #fear# #chapter# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ a dull and dismal #light# was shed over the bedclothes and curtains surrounding the young #girl#
it was then that the #door# of $edward$ #room# opened and a #head# we have before noticed appeared in the #glass# opposite it was #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who came to witness the #effect# of the drink she had prepared
all #noise# in the #street# had ceased and the #silence# was frightful she stopped in the doorway listened for a #moment# to the flickering of the lamp
the only #sound# in that deserted #room# and then advanced to the #table# to see if $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #glass# were empty it was still about a #quarter# full as we before stated
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ emptied the contents into the ashes which she disturbed that they might the more readily absorb the liquid then she carefully rinsed the #glass# and wiping it with her handkerchief replaced it on the #table#
if #anyone# could have looked into the #room# just then he would have noticed the hesitation with which #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ approached the #bed# and looked fixedly on $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
the dim #light# the profound #silence# and the gloomy #thought# inspired by the #hour# and still more by her own conscience all combined to produce a sensation of #fear# the poisoner was terrified at the contemplation of her own #work#
at #length# she rallied drew aside the curtain and leaning over the pillow gazed intently on $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ the young #girl# no longer breathed no breath issued through the #half# closed teeth the white #lip# no longer quivered
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ gazed upon the #face# so expressive even in its stillness then she ventured to raise the coverlet and press her #hand# upon the young #girl#
the #eye# were suffused with a bluish vapor and the long black lashes rested on a cheek white as wax #heart#
it was cold and motionless she only felt the pulsation in her own #finger# and withdrew her #hand# with a shudder
#one# #arm# was hanging out of the #bed# from #shoulder# to elbow it was moulded after the #arm# of germain pillon
but the fore #arm# seemed to be slightly distorted by convulsion and the #hand# so delicately formed was resting with stiff outstretched #finger# on the framework of the #bed#
graces the nails too were turning blue #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had no longer any #doubt# all was over she had consummated the last terrible #work# she had to accomplish
there was no more to do in the #room# so the poisoner retired stealthily as though fearing to hear the #sound# of her own footsteps but as she withdrew she still held aside the curtain absorbed in the irresistible attraction always exerted by the picture of #death# so long as it is merely mysterious and does not excite disgust
the #minute# passed #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ could not drop the curtain which she held like a funeral pall over the #head# of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
she was lost in reverie and the reverie of #crime# is remorse just then the lamp again flickered the #noise# startled #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who shuddered and dropped the curtain
immediately afterwards the #light# expired and the #room# was plunged in frightful obscurity while the clock at that #minute# struck #half# past four
overpowered with agitation the poisoner succeeded in groping her #way# to the #door# and reached her #room# in an agony of #fear#
the #darkness# lasted two #hour# longer then by degrees a cold #light# crept through the venetian blinds until at #length# it revealed the objects in the #room#
about this #time# the nurse cough was heard on the stairs and the #woman# entered the #room# with a cup in her #hand#
to the tender #eye# of a #father# or a lover the first #glance# would have sufficed to reveal $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ condition but to this hireling $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ only appeared to sleep
then she went to the fireplace and lit the #fire# and although she had just left her #bed# she could not resist the temptation offered by $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ sleep so she threw herself into an armchair to snatch a little more #rest#
good she exclaimed approaching the #table# she has taken #part# of her draught the #glass# is three #quarter# empty the clock striking eight awoke her
astonished at the prolonged slumber of the patient and frightened to see that the #arm# was still hanging out of the #bed# she advanced towards $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and for the first #time# noticed the white #lip#
she tried to replace the #arm# but it moved with a frightful rigidity which could not deceive a sick nurse she screamed aloud then running to the #door# exclaimed
what is the #matter# asked $m_d_avrigny$ at the #foot# of the stairs it being the #hour# he usually visited her
help help what is it asked $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ rushing from his #room# #doctor# do you hear them call for help
but before the #doctor# and the #father# could reach the #room# the #servant# who were on the same #floor# had entered and seeing $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ pale and motionless on her #bed# they lifted up their #hand# towards heaven and stood transfixed as though struck by lightening
yes yes let us hasten up it was in $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #room# call #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ wake #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
but instead of obeying him the #servant# stood watching $m_d_avrigny$ who ran to $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and raised her in his #arm#
cried the #procureur# from the #door# of his #chamber# which apparently he scarcely dared to leave what this #one# too he exclaimed
oh where #will# be the #end# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ rushed into the #room# what are you saying #doctor# he exclaimed raising his #hand# to heaven
i say that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ is dead replied avrigny in a #voice# terrible in its solemn calmness $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ staggered and buried his #head# in the #bed#
on the exclamation of the #doctor# and the #cry# of the #father# the #servant# all fled with muttered imprecations they were heard running down the stairs and through the long passages then there was a rush in the #court# afterwards all was still they had #one# and all deserted the accursed $house_of_peers$
just then #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in the act of slipping on her dressing gown threw aside the drapery and for a #moment# stood motionless as though interrogating the occupants of the #room# while she endeavored to call up some rebellious #tear#
on a sudden she stepped or rather bounded with outstretched #arm# towards the #table# she saw avrigny curiously examining the #glass# which she felt certain of having emptied during the #night#
it was now a third full just as it was when she threw the contents into the ashes the spectre of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ rising before the poisoner would have alarmed her less
it was indeed the same color as the draught she had poured into the #glass# and which $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had drunk it was indeed the #poison# which could not deceive $m_d_avrigny$ which he now examined so closely
it was doubtless a miracle from heaven that notwithstanding her precautions there should be some trace some #proof# remaining to reveal the #crime#
while #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ remained rooted to the #spot# like a statue of #terror# and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with his #head# hidden in the bedclothes saw #nothing# around him avrigny approached the #window# that he might the better examine the contents of the #glass# and dipping the tip of his #finger# in tasted it
then he ran to #one# of the cupboards in $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #room# which had been transformed into a medicine closet and taking from its silver #case# a small bottle of nitric acid dropped a little of it into the liquor which immediately changed to a #blood# red color
ah exclaimed avrigny in a #voice# in which the horror of a judge unveiling the #truth# was mingled with the delight of a student making a discovery
ah he exclaimed it is no longer brucine that is used let me see what it is #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was overpowered her #eye# first flashed and then swam she staggered towards the #door# and disappeared
directly afterwards the distant #sound# of a heavy weight falling on the #ground# was heard but no #one# paid any #attention# to it the nurse was engaged in watching the chemical analysis and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was still absorbed in #grief#
he lifted up the drapery over the entrance to $edward$ #room# and his #eye# reaching as far as #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #apartment# he beheld her extended lifeless on the #floor#
m avrigny alone had followed #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with his #eye# and watched her hurried retreat go to the assistance of #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ he said to the nurse
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ is ill but $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ stammered the nurse $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ no longer requires help said avrigny since she is dead
groaned forth $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in a paroxysm of #grief# which was the more terrible from the novelty of the sensation in the #iron# #heart# of that #man#
dead dead dead repeated a third #voice# who said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ was dead the two #man# turned round and saw $m_maximilian_morrel$ standing at the #door# pale and #terror# stricken
this is what had happened at the usual #time# $m_maximilian_morrel$ had presented himself at the little #door# leading to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #room#
he waited for a #moment# in the hall and called for a #servant# to conduct him to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ but no #one# answered the #servant# having as we know deserted the $house_of_peers$
$m_maximilian_morrel$ had no particular #reason# for uneasiness $m_de_monte_cristo$ had promised him that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ should live and so far he had always fulfilled his #word#
#contrary# to custom the #door# was open and having no occasion to ring he entered every #night# the #count# had given him news which was the next #morning# confirmed by $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
still this extraordinary #silence# appeared strange to him and he called a second and third #time# still no #answer# then he determined to go up
the first #thing# he saw was the old #man# sitting in his armchair in his usual #place# but his #eye# expressed alarm which was confirmed by the pallor which overspread his #feature#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #room# was opened like all the #rest# how are you #sir# asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ with a sickness of #heart#
well answered the old #man# by closing his #eye# but his #appearance# manifested increasing uneasiness you are thoughtful #sir# continued $m_maximilian_morrel$ you want #something# shall i call #one# of the #servant#
yes replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ pulled the bell but though he nearly broke the cord no #one# answered he turned towards $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the pallor and anguish expressed on his #countenance# momentarily increased
oh exclaimed $m_maximilian_morrel$ why do they not come is #anyone# ill in the $house_of_peers$ the #eye# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ seemed as though they would start from their sockets
what is the #matter# you alarm me $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ valentine yes yes signed $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ tried to speak but he could articulate #nothing# he staggered and supported himself against the wainscot
then he pointed to the #door# yes yes yes continued the old #man# $m_maximilian_morrel$ rushed up the little #staircase# while $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #eye# seemed to say quicker quicker
in a #minute# the young #man# darted through several #room# till at #length# he reached $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ there was no occasion to push the #door# it was wide open
a sob was the only #sound# he heard he saw as though in a mist a black figure kneeling and buried in a confused mass of white drapery
a terrible #fear# transfixed him it was then he heard a #voice# exclaim $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ is dead and another #voice# which like an echo repeated dead dead #chapter#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ rose #half# ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of #grief# the terrible office he had held for twenty five #year# had succeeded in making him more or less than #man#
who are you #sir# he asked that forget that this is not the #manner# to enter a $house_of_peers$ stricken with #death#
but $m_maximilian_morrel$ remained motionless he could not detach his #eye# from that disordered #bed# and the pale corpse of the young #girl# who was lying on it
his #glance# at first wandering fixed itself upon $m_maximilian_morrel$ go #sir# go go do you hear said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ while avrigny advanced to lead $m_maximilian_morrel$ out
$m_maximilian_morrel$ stared for a #moment# at the corpse gazed all around the #room# then upon the two #man# he opened his mouth to speak but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable #idea# that occupied his brain he went out thrusting his #hand# through his #hair# in such a #manner# that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and avrigny for a #moment# diverted from the engrossing topic exchanged #glance# which seemed to say he is mad
but in less than five #minute# the #staircase# groaned beneath an extraordinary weight $m_maximilian_morrel$ was seen carrying with superhuman #strength# the armchair containing $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ upstairs
when he reached the landing he placed the armchair on the #floor# and rapidly rolled it into $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #room# this could only have been accomplished by #mean# of unnatural #strength# supplied by powerful excitement
but the most fearful spectacle was $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ being pushed towards the #bed# his #face# expressing all his meaning and his #eye# supplying the want of every #other# faculty
that pale #face# and flaming #glance# appeared to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ like a frightful apparition each #time# he had been brought into contact with his #father# #something# terrible had happened
see what they have done cried $m_maximilian_morrel$ with #one# #hand# leaning on the back of the #chair# and the #other# extended towards $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ drew back and looked with #astonishment# on the young #man# who almost a #stranger# to him called $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ his #father#
at this #moment# the whole soul of the old #man# seemed centred in his #eye# which became bloodshot the veins of the throat swelled his cheeks and temples became purple as though he was struck with epilepsy #nothing# was wanting to complete this but the utterance of a #cry#
see my #father# see and the #cry# issued from his pores if we may thus speak a #cry# frightful in its #silence#
$m_d_avrigny$ rushed towards the old #man# and made him inhale a powerful restorative #sir# cried $m_maximilian_morrel$ seizing the moist #hand# of the paralytic
they ask me who i am and what #right# i have to be here oh you know it tell them tell them
and the young #man# #voice# was choked by sobs as for the old #man# his chest heaved with his panting respiration
#one# could have #thought# that he was undergoing the agonies preceding #death# at #length# happier than the young #man# who sobbed without weeping #tear# glistened in the #eye# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
tell them said $m_maximilian_morrel$ in a hoarse #voice# tell them that i am her betrothed tell them she was my beloved my noble #girl# my only blessing in the #world#
the young #man# overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish fell heavily on his knees before the #bed# which his #finger# grasped with convulsive energy
$m_d_avrigny$ unable to bear the #sight# of this touching #emotion# turned away and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ without seeking any further explanation and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which draws us towards those who have loved the #people# for whom we mourn extended his #hand# towards the young #man#
but $m_maximilian_morrel$ saw #nothing# he had grasped the #hand# of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and unable to weep vented his agony in groans as he bit the sheets
tell them oh tell them that corpse belongs to me for some #time# #nothing# was heard in that #chamber# but sobs exclamations and prayers
at #length# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the most composed of all spoke #sir# said he to $m_maximilian_morrel$ you say you loved $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ that you were betrothed to her
i knew #nothing# of this engagement of this #love# yet i her #father# forgive you for i see that your #grief# is real and deep and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a #place# in my #heart#
but you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this #earth# she has #nothing# more to do with the adoration of #man#
take a last farewell #sir# of her sad remains take the #hand# you expected to possess once more within your own and then separate yourself from her forever
you are mistaken #sir# exclaimed $m_maximilian_morrel$ raising himself on #one# knee his #heart# pierced by a more acute pang than any he had yet felt you are mistaken $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ dying as she has not only requires a #priest# but an avenger
$mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ now requires only the ministrations of the #priest# you $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ send for the #priest# i #will# be the avenger
what do you #mean# #sir# asked $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ trembling at the new #idea# inspired by the delirium of $m_maximilian_morrel$
i tell you #sir# that two #person# exist in you the #father# has mourned sufficiently now let the #procureur# fulfil his office
the #eye# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ glistened and avrigny approached #gentleman# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ reading all that passed through the #mind# of the witnesses to the #scene#
i know what i am saying and you know as well as i do what i am about to say $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ has been assassinated
now #sir# continued $m_maximilian_morrel$ in these #day# no #one# can disappear by violent #mean# without some inquiries being made as to the cause of her disappearance even were she not a young beautiful and adorable creature like $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ hung his #head# avrigny approached nearer and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ said yes with his #eye# now le #procureur# du roi said $m_maximilian_morrel$ with increasing vehemence
no mercy is allowed i denounce the #crime# it is your #place# to seek the assassin the young #man# implacable #eye# interrogated $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who on his #side# glanced from $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ to avrigny
but instead of finding sympathy in the #eye# of the #doctor# and his #father# he only saw an #expression# as inflexible as that of $m_maximilian_morrel$
#sir# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ striving to struggle against this triple force and his own #emotion# #sir# you are deceived no #one# commits #crime# here
yes indicated the old #man# assuredly said avrigny i am stricken by fate it is horrible indeed but no #one# assassinates
the #eye# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ lighted up with rage and avrigny prepared to speak $m_maximilian_morrel$ however extended his #arm# and commanded #silence#
and i say that murders are committed here said $m_maximilian_morrel$ whose #voice# though lower in #tone# lost none of its terrible distinctness
i tell you $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #life# was attempted by #poison# four #day# ago though she escaped owing to the precautions of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
i tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four #month# i tell you that the dose has been double the #poison# changed and that this #time# it has succeeded
i tell you that you know these #thing# as well as i do since this #gentleman# has forewarned you both as a #doctor# and as a #friend#
oh you rave #sir# exclaimed $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in vain endeavoring to escape the net in which he was taken m
ask him #sir# if he recollects the #word# he uttered in the #garden# of this $house_of_peers$ on the #night# of $madame_de_saint_méran$ #death#
you #thought# yourselves alone and talked about that tragical #death# and the fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
i rave said $m_maximilian_morrel$ well then i appeal to $m_d_avrigny$ himself $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and avrigny exchanged #look# yes yes continued $m_maximilian_morrel$
certainly after witnessing the culpable indolence manifested by $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ towards his own relations i ought to have denounced him to the authorities then i should not have been an accomplice to thy #death# as i now am sweet beloved $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ but the accomplice shall become the avenger
this fourth murder is apparent to all and if thy #father# abandon thee $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ it is i and i swear it that shall pursue the assassin
recall the #scene# for the #word# you #thought# were only given to #silence# and solitude fell into my ears
and this #time# as though #nature# had at least taken compassion on the vigorous frame nearly bursting with its own #strength# the #word# of $m_maximilian_morrel$ were stifled in his throat his breast heaved the #tear# so long rebellious gushed from his #eye# and he threw himself weeping on his knees by the #side# of the #bed#
i unite with $m_maximilian_morrel$ in demanding #justice# for #crime# my #blood# boils at the #idea# of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly concession
then avrigny spoke and i too he exclaimed in a low #voice# oh merciful heavens murmured $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
$m_maximilian_morrel$ raised his #head# and reading the #eye# of the old #man# which gleamed with unnatural lustre stay he said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #wish# to speak
yes indicated $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with an #expression# the more terrible from all his faculties being centred in his #glance#
do you know the assassin asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ yes replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and #will# you direct us exclaimed the young #man#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looked upon $m_maximilian_morrel$ with #one# of those melancholy #smile# which had so often made $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ happy and thus fixed his #attention#
listen $m_d_avrigny$ listen then having riveted the #eye# of his interlocutor on his own he glanced towards the #door#
do you #wish# me to leave said $m_maximilian_morrel$ sadly yes replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ alas alas #sir# have #pity# on me
the old #man# #eye# remained fixed on the #door# may i at least #return# asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ yes
must i leave alone no whom am i to take with me the #procureur# no the #doctor#
yes you #wish# to remain alone with $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ yes but can he understand you
oh said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ inexpressibly delighted to think that the inquiries were to be made by him alone oh be satisfied i can understand my #father#
yes while uttering these #word# with this #expression# of #joy# his teeth clashed together violently avrigny took the young #man# #arm# and led him out of the #room#
at the #end# of a #quarter# of an #hour# a faltering footstep was heard and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ appeared at the #door# of the #apartment# where avrigny and $m_maximilian_morrel$ had been staying #one# absorbed in meditation the #other# in #grief#
a more than deathlike #silence# then reigned in the $house_of_peers$ you can come he said and led them back to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
his #face# was livid large drops rolled down his #face# and in his #finger# he held the fragments of a quill pen which he had torn to atoms
#gentleman# he said in a hoarse #voice# give me your #word# of #honor# that this horrible #secret# shall forever remain buried amongst ourselves
$m_maximilian_morrel$ looked attentively on $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the two #man# drew back i entreat you continued $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ but said $m_maximilian_morrel$
my #father# has revealed the culprit #name# my #father# thirsts for revenge as much as you do yet even he conjures you as i do to keep this #secret#
the culprit the murderer the assassin do not alarm yourself #sir# #justice# #will# be done said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ do you not #father#
oh #sir# said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ arresting $m_maximilian_morrel$ by the #arm# if my #father# the inflexible #man# makes this request it is because he knows be assured that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #will# be terribly revenged
yes resolutely replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ suffered an exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him is it not so #father#
the old #man# made a #sign# in the affirmative $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ continued he knows me and i have pledged my #word# to him
#rest# assured #gentleman# that within three #day# in a less #time# than #justice# would demand the revenge i shall have taken for the murder of my #child# #will# be such as to make the boldest #heart# tremble and as he spoke these #word# he #ground# his teeth and grasped the old #man# senseless #hand#
#will# this #promise# be fulfilled $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ while avrigny looked inquiringly yes replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with an #expression# of sinister #joy#
swear then said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ joining the #hand# of $m_maximilian_morrel$ and avrigny swear that you #will# spare the #honor# of my $house_of_peers$ and leave me to avenge my #child#
yes but $m_maximilian_morrel$ disengaging his #hand# rushed to the #bed# and after having pressed the cold #lip# of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ with his own hurriedly left uttering a long deep groan of #despair# and anguish
avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble we have before stated that all the #servant# had fled
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was therefore obliged to request $m_d_avrigny$ to superintend all the arrangements consequent upon a #death# in a large city more especially a #death# under such suspicious #circumstance#
it was #something# terrible to witness the silent agony the mute #despair# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ whose #tear# silently rolled down his cheeks
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ retired to his #study# and avrigny left to summon the #doctor# of the mayoralty whose office it is to examine #body# after decease and who is expressly named the #doctor# of the dead
at the #end# of a #quarter# of an #hour# $m_d_avrigny$ returned with his associate they found the outer #gate# closed and not a #servant# remaining in the $house_of_peers$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ himself was obliged to open to them
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ could not be persuaded to quit his grandchild but he stopped on the landing he had not the courage to again #visit# the #death# #chamber#
the district #doctor# approached with the indifference of a #man# accustomed to spend #half# his #time# amongst the dead he then lifted the sheet which was placed over the #face# and just unclosed the #lip#
the two #doctor# therefore entered the #room# alone $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was near the #bed# pale motionless and silent as the corpse
alas said avrigny she is indeed dead poor #child# yes answered the #doctor# laconically dropping the sheet he had raised
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ uttered a kind of hoarse rattling #sound# the old #man# #eye# sparkled and the good #doctor# understood that he wished to behold his #child#
he therefore approached the #bed# and while his #companion# was dipping the #finger# with which he had touched the #lip# of the corpse in chloride of lime he uncovered the calm and pale #face# which looked like that of a sleeping angel
the #doctor# of the dead then laid his permit on the #corner# of the #table# and having fulfilled his #duty# was conducted out by avrigny
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ met them at the #door# of his #study# having in a few #word# thanked the district #doctor# he turned to avrigny and said
a #tear# which appeared in the old #man# #eye# expressed his #thank# to the #doctor# and now the #priest#
is there any particular #priest# you #wish# to pray with $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ asked avrigny no said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ fetch the nearest
the nearest said the district #doctor# is a good italian #abbé# who #life# next #door# to you shall i call on him as i pass
here is the key of the #door# so that you can go in and out as you please you #will# bring the #priest# with you and #will# oblige me by introducing him into my #child# #room#
avrigny said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ be so kind i beseech you as to accompany this #gentleman# do you #wish# to see him
i only #wish# to be alone you #will# excuse me #will# you not a #priest# can understand a #father# #grief#
and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ giving the key to avrigny again bade farewell to the strange #doctor# and retired to his #study# where he began to #work#
as the #doctor# entered the #street# they saw a #man# in a cassock standing on the threshold of the next #door#
for some temperaments #work# is a remedy for all afflictions this is the #abbé# of whom i spoke said the #doctor# to avrigny
#sir# he said are you disposed to confer a great obligation on an unhappy #father# who has just lost his #daughter#
$m_d_avrigny$ accosted the #priest# i #mean# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the #king# attorney ah said the #priest# in a marked italian accent yes i have heard that #death# is in that $house_of_peers$
then i need not tell you what kind of #service# he requires of you i was about to offer myself #sir# said the #priest# it is our mission to forestall our #duty#
it is a young #girl# i know it #sir# the #servant# who fled from the $house_of_peers$ informed me
i also know that her #name# is $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and i have already prayed for her #thank# you #sir# said avrigny
since you have commenced your sacred office deign to continue it come and watch by the dead and all the wretched #family# #will# be grateful to you
i am going #sir# and i do not hesitate to say that no prayers #will# be more fervent than mine
$m_d_avrigny$ took the #priest# #hand# and without meeting $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who was engaged in his #study# they reached $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #room# which on the following #night# was to be occupied by the undertakers
on entering the #room# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #eye# met those of the #abbé# and no #doubt# he read some particular #expression# in them for he remained in the #room#
$m_d_avrigny$ recommended the #attention# of the #priest# to the living as well as to the dead and the #abbé# promised to devote his prayers to $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and his #attention# to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
in #order# doubtless that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling his sacred mission the #priest# rose as soon as avrigny departed and not only bolted the #door# through which the #doctor# had just left but also that leading to #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #room#
during the #night# the undertakers had executed their melancholy office and wrapped the corpse in the winding sheet which whatever may be said about the equality of #death# is at least a last #proof# of the luxury so pleasing in #life#
#chapter# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ signature the next #morning# dawned dull and cloudy this winding sheet was #nothing# more than a beautiful #piece# of cambric which the young #girl# had bought a fortnight before
during the #evening# two #man# engaged for the #purpose# had carried $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ from $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #room# into his own and #contrary# to all expectation there was no difficulty in withdrawing him from his #child#
$m_d_avrigny$ returned about eight clock in the #morning# he met $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ on his #way# to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #room# and accompanied him to see how the old #man# had slept
they found him in the large armchair which served him for a #bed# enjoying a calm nay almost a smiling sleep
the $abbé_busoni$ had watched till daylight and then left without calling #anyone# they both stood in amazement at the #door#
see said avrigny to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #nature# knows how to alleviate the deepest sorrow no #one# can say that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ did not #love# his #child# and yet he sleeps
yes you are #right# replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ surprised he sleeps indeed and this is the more strange since the least contradiction keeps him awake all #night#
#grief# has stunned him replied avrigny and they both returned thoughtfully to the #procureur# #study# see i have not slept said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ showing his undisturbed #bed# #grief# does not stun me
i have not been in #bed# for two #night# but then #look# at my desk see what i have written during these two #day# and #night#
oh #work# work my passion my #joy# my delight it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows and he convulsively grasped the #hand# of avrigny
i have filled those #paper# and have made out the accusation against the assassin $m_benedetto$ do you require my #service# now asked avrigny
no said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ only #return# again at eleven clock at twelve the the oh heavens my poor poor #child# and the #procureur# again becoming a #man# lifted up his #eye# and groaned
shall you be present in the reception #room# no i have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office i shall #work# #doctor#
when i #work# i forget #everything# and indeed no sooner had the #doctor# left the #room# than he was again absorbed in #work#
on the doorsteps avrigny met the cousin whom $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had mentioned a personage as insignificant in our #story# as in the #world#
he was punctual dressed in black with crape around his hat and presented himself at his cousin with a #face# made up for the occasion and which he could alter as might be required
at eleven clock the mourning coaches rolled into the paved #court# and the rue du $faubourg_saint_honoré$ was filled with a crowd of idlers equally pleased to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich and who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the #marriage# of a duchess
he occupied #one# of those beings designed from their birth to make themselves useful to #other# gradually the reception #room# filled and some of our old #friend# made their #appearance#
we #mean# $m_lucien_debray$ $baron_de_château_renaud$ and $m_beauchamp$ accompanied by all the leading #man# of the #day# at the bar in literature or the army for $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ moved in the first parisian circles less owing to his social #position# than to his personal merit
the cousin standing at the #door# ushered in the #guest# and it was rather a relief to the indifferent to see a #person# as unmoved as themselves and who did not exact a mournful #face# or force #tear# as would have been the #case# with a #father# a #brother# or a lover
poor #girl# said $m_lucien_debray$ like the #rest# paying an involuntary tribute to the sad #event# poor #girl# so young so rich so beautiful
could you have imagined this #scene# $baron_de_château_renaud$ when we saw her at the most three weeks ago about to #sign# that contract
those who were acquainted soon formed into little groups #one# of them was made of $m_lucien_debray$ $baron_de_château_renaud$ and $m_beauchamp$
i spoke to her once or twice at #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ among the #rest# she appeared to me charming though rather melancholy
indeed no said $baron_de_château_renaud$ did you know her where is her stepmother do you know she is spending the #day# with the #wife# of the worthy #gentleman# who is receiving us
who is he whom do you #mean# the #gentleman# who receives us is he a deputy
oh no i am condemned to witness those #gentleman# every #day# said $m_beauchamp$ but he is perfectly unknown to me
it has been mentioned but the article is not mine indeed i #doubt# if it #will# please $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ for it says that if four successive #death# had happened anywhere else than in the $house_of_peers$ of the #king# attorney he would have interested himself somewhat more about it
have you mentioned this #death# in your #paper# still said $baron_de_château_renaud$ dr avrigny who attends my #mother# declares he is in #despair# about it
but whom are you seeking $m_lucien_debray$ i am seeking the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ said the young #man#
i met him on the boulevard on my #way# here said $m_beauchamp$ i think he is about to leave paris he was going to his #banker#
his #banker# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ is his #banker# is he not asked $baron_de_château_renaud$ of $m_lucien_debray$ i believe so replied the secretary with slight uneasiness
but $m_de_monte_cristo$ is not the only #one# i miss here i do not see $m_maximilian_morrel$ morrel do they know him asked $baron_de_château_renaud$
i think he has only been introduced to #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ still he ought to have been here said $m_lucien_debray$
but hush here comes our #minister# of #justice# he #will# feel obliged to make some little speech to the cousin and the three young #man# drew near to listen
$m_beauchamp$ told the #truth# when he said that on his #way# to the funeral he had met $m_de_monte_cristo$ who was directing his #step# towards the rue de la chaussée antin to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
the #banker# saw the #carriage# of the #count# enter the courtyard and advanced to meet him with a sad though affable #smile#
i wonder what #will# be talked about tonight this funeral is the news of the #day# well said he extending his #hand# to $m_de_monte_cristo$
when i perceived you i was just asking myself whether i had not wished harm towards those poor morcerfs which would have justified the proverb of
i suppose you have come to sympathize with me for indeed #misfortune# has taken #possession# of my $house_of_peers$ he who #wish# #misfortune# to happen to #other# experiences them himself
i wished no ill to $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he was a little proud perhaps for a #man# who like myself has risen from #nothing# but we all have our faults
that #person# of our #time# of #life# not that you belong to the class you are still a young #man# but as i was saying #person# of our #time# of #life# have been very unfortunate this #year#
for example #look# at the puritanical #procureur# who has just lost his #daughter# and in #fact# nearly all his #family# in so singular a #manner# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ dishonored and dead and then myself covered with ridicule through the villany of $m_benedetto$ besides
well on my #word# of #honor# i answered no do you know #count# besides what asked the #count#
alas do you not know what new calamity my #daughter# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ has left us
good heavens what are you telling me the #truth# my dear #count# oh how happy you must be in not having either #wife# or #child#
do you think so indeed i do and so $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ she could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch so she asked permission to travel
and is she gone the #other# #night# she left with #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ no with a relation
but still we have quite lost our dear $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ for i #doubt# whether her pride #will# ever allow her to #return# to france
still #baron# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ #family# #grief# or indeed any #other# affliction which would crush a #man# whose #child# was his only #treasure# are endurable to a millionaire
philosophers may well say and practical #man# #will# always support the #opinion# that #money# mitigates many trials and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm you ought to be very easily consoled
you the #king# of finance the focus of immeasurable #power# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ looked at him askance as though to ascertain whether he spoke seriously
so rich dear #sir# that your #fortune# resembles the pyramids if you wished to demolish them you could not and if it were possible you would not dare
yes he answered if a #fortune# brings consolation i ought to be consoled i am rich $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ smiled at the good natured pleasantry of the #count#
that reminds me he said that when you entered i was on the #point# of signing five little bonds i have already signed two #will# you allow me to do the same to the #other#
there was a #moment# #silence# during which the #noise# of the #banker# pen was alone heard while $m_de_monte_cristo$ examined the gilt mouldings on the ceiling
pray do so are they spanish haitian or neapolitan bonds said $m_de_monte_cristo$ no said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ smiling they are bonds on the bank of france payable to bearer
you who may be called the emperor if i claim the title of #king# of finance have you many #piece# of #paper# of this size each worth a #million#
stay #count# he added the #count# took into his #hand# the #paper# which $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had so proudly presented to him and
please pay to my #order# from the fund deposited by me the #sum# of a #million# and charge the same to my #account#
read to the #governor# of the bank #baron# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #one# two three four five said $m_de_monte_cristo$
five #million# why what a crœsus you are this is how i transact #business# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ it is really wonderful said the #count# above all if as i suppose it is payable at #sight#
it is indeed said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ it is a fine #thing# to have such credit really it is only in france these #thing# are done
five #million# on five little scraps of #paper# it must be seen to be believed you do not #doubt# it
you say so with an accent stay you shall be convinced take my clerk to the bank and you #will# see him leave it with an #order# on the treasury for the same #sum#
no said $m_de_monte_cristo$ folding the five #note# most decidedly not the #thing# is so curious i #will# make the experiment myself
no i am credited on you for six #million# i have drawn nine hundred thousand #franc# you therefore still owe me five #million# and a hundred thousand #franc#
i #will# take the five scraps of #paper# that i now hold as bonds with your signature alone and here is a receipt in full for the six #million# between us
and $m_de_monte_cristo$ placed the bonds in his #pocket# with #one# #hand# while with the #other# he held out the receipt to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
i had prepared it beforehand for i am much in want of #money# #today# if a thunderbolt had fallen at the #banker# #foot# he could not have experienced greater #terror#
excuse me excuse me but i owe this #money# to the charity fund a deposit which i promised to pay this #morning#
what he stammered do you #mean# to keep that #money# oh well then said $m_de_monte_cristo$
i am not particular about these five #note# pay me in a different form i wished from curiosity to take these that i might be able to say that without any advice or preparation the $house_of_peers$ of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had paid me five #million# without a #minute#
but here are your bonds pay me differently and he held the bonds towards $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who seized them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold the food that is being wrested from its grasp
suddenly he rallied made a violent #effort# to restrain himself and then a #smile# gradually widened the #feature# of his disturbed #countenance#
oh dear yes and if you were at rome the $house_of_peers$ of $thomson_french_of_rome$ would make no more difficulty about paying the #money# on my receipt than you have just done
delay it would have been remarkable certainly he said your receipt is #money# pardon me #count# pardon me
then i may keep this #money# yes said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ while the perspiration started from the roots of his #hair#
yes keep it keep it $m_de_monte_cristo$ replaced the #note# in his #pocket# with that indescribable #expression# which seemed to say
come reflect if you repent there is still #time# no said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ no decidedly no keep my signatures
but you know none are so formal as #banker# in transacting #business# i intended this #money# for the charity fund and i seemed to be robbing them if i did not pay them with these precise bonds
how absurd as if #one# crown were not as good as another excuse me and he began to laugh loudly but nervously
certainly i excuse you said $m_de_monte_cristo$ graciously and #pocket# them and he placed the bonds in his #pocket# book
but said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ there is still a #sum# of #one# hundred thousand #franc# oh a mere #nothing# said $m_de_monte_cristo$
the balance would come to about that #sum# but keep it and we shall be quits #count# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ are you speaking seriously
i never joke with #banker# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ in a freezing #manner# which repelled impertinence and he turned to the #door# just as the #valet# de chambre announced $m_de_boville$ receiver general of the charities
ma foi said $m_de_monte_cristo$ i think i arrived just in #time# to obtain your signatures or they would have been disputed with me
$m_de_monte_cristo$ exchanged a ceremonious bow with $m_de_boville$ who was standing in the waiting #room# and who was introduced into $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #room# as soon as the #count# had left
the #count# serious #face# was illumined by a faint #smile# as he noticed the portfolio which the receiver general held in his #hand#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ again became pale and hastened to conduct the #count# out at the #door# he found his #carriage# and was immediately driven to the bank
meanwhile $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ repressing all #emotion# advanced to meet the receiver general we need not say that a #smile# of condescension was stamped upon his #lip#
good #morning# creditor said he for i wager #anything# it is the creditor who #visit# me you are #right# #baron# answered $m_de_boville$
the charities present themselves to you through me the widows and orphans depute me to receive alms to the amount of five #million# from you
and yet they say orphans are to be pitied said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ wishing to prolong the jest poor #thing#
here i am in their #name# said $m_de_boville$ but did you receive my #letter# #yesterday#
my dear $m_de_boville$ your widows and orphans must oblige me by waiting twenty four #hour# since de $m_de_monte_cristo$ whom you just saw leaving here
yes i have brought my receipt you did see him i think
yes well well de $m_de_monte_cristo$ has just carried off their five #million# how so
the #count# has an unlimited credit upon me a credit opened by $thomson_french_of_rome$ he came to demand five #million# at once which i paid him with checks on the bank
my funds are deposited there and you can understand that if i draw out ten #million# on the same #day# it #will# appear rather strange to the #governor#
two #day# #will# be a different #thing# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ smiling come said $m_de_boville$ with a #tone# of entire incredulity
five #million# to that #gentleman# who just left and who bowed to me as though he knew me perhaps he knows you though you do not know him de $m_de_monte_cristo$ knows everybody
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ presented him and read received of #baron# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ the #sum# of five #million# #one# hundred thousand #franc# to be repaid on demand by the $house_of_peers$ of $thomson_french_of_rome$
five #million# here is his receipt believe your own #eye# $m_de_boville$ took the #paper#
it is really true said $m_de_boville$ do you know the $house_of_peers$ of $thomson_french_of_rome$
yes i once had #business# to transact with it to the amount of #franc# but since then i have not heard it mentioned
it is #one# of the best #house# in europe said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ carelessly throwing down the receipt on his desk
and he had five #million# in your #hand# alone why this #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ must be a nabob
indeed i do not know what he is he has three unlimited credits #one# on me #one# on rothschild #one# on lafitte and you see
he added carelessly he has given me the preference by leaving a balance of #franc# $m_de_boville$ manifested #sign# of extraordinary admiration
i must #visit# him he said and obtain some pious grant from him oh you may make sure of him his charities alone amount to #franc# a #month#
it is magnificent i #will# set before him the example of #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and her #son#
what example they gave all their #fortune# to the hospitals what #fortune# their own de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ who is deceased
for what #reason# because they would not spend #money# so guiltily acquired and what are they to live upon
the #mother# retires into the #country# and the #son# enters the army well i must confess these are scruples
i registered their deed of gift #yesterday# and how much did they possess oh not much from twelve to thirteen hundred thousand #franc#
but to #return# to our #million# certainly said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ in the most natural #tone# in the #world# are you then pressed for this #money#
yes for the examination of our cash takes #place# #tomorrow# #tomorrow# why did you not tell me so before
why it is as good as a century at what #hour# does the examination take #place# at two clock send at twelve said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ smiling
$m_de_boville$ said #nothing# but nodded his #head# and took up the portfolio now i think of it you can do better said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
the receipt of de $m_de_monte_cristo$ is as good as #money# take it to rothschild or lafitte and they #will# take it off your #hand# at once
how do you #mean# what though payable at rome certainly it #will# only cost you a discount of or #franc#
the receiver started back ma foi he said i prefer waiting till #tomorrow# what a proposition
i #thought# perhaps said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with supreme impertinence that you had a deficiency to make up indeed said the receiver
and if that were the #case# it would be worth while to make some sacrifice #thank# you no #sir#
then it #will# be #tomorrow# yes but without fail ah you are laughing at me send #tomorrow# at twelve and the bank shall be notified
i #will# come myself better still since it #will# afford me the #pleasure# of seeing you
by the #way# said $m_de_boville$ are you not going to the funeral of poor $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ which i met on my #road# here
they shook #hand# no said the #banker# i have appeared rather ridiculous since that #affair# of $m_benedetto$ so i remain in the background
bah you are wrong how were you to blame in that #affair# listen when #one# bears an irreproachable #name# as i do #one# is rather sensitive
everybody pities you #sir# and above all $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ poor $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ do you know she is going to embrace a religious #life#
the #day# after the #event# she decided on leaving paris with a nun of her acquaintance they are gone to seek a very strict convent in italy or spain
no alas it is unhappily but too true oh it is terrible and $m_de_boville$ retired with this exclamation after expressing acute sympathy with the #father#
but he had scarcely left before $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with an energy of action those can alone understand who have seen robert macaire represented by frédérick exclaimed
fool then enclosing $m_de_monte_cristo$ receipt in a little #pocket# book he added yes come at twelve clock i shall then be far away
then he double locked his #door# emptied all his drawers collected about fifty thousand #franc# in bank #note# burned several #paper# left #other# exposed to view and then commenced writing a #letter# which he addressed
to #madame# la baronne $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i #will# #place# it on her #table# myself tonight he murmured then taking a passport from his drawer he said good it is available for two #month# longer
the cemetery of père lachaise $m_de_boville$ had indeed met the funeral procession which was taking $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ to her last home on #earth#
the weather was dull and stormy a cold wind shook the few remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the #tree# and scattered them among the crowd which filled the boulevards
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ a true parisian considered the cemetery of père lachaise alone worthy of receiving the mortal remains of a parisian #family# there alone the corpses belonging to him would be surrounded by worthy associates
#chapter# he had therefore purchased a vault which was quickly occupied by members of his #family# on the front of the monument was inscribed
the #family# of $madame_de_saint_méran$ and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ for such had been the last #wish# expressed by poor $renée$ $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #mother# the pompous procession therefore wended its #way# towards père lachaise from the $faubourg_saint_honoré$
more than fifty private #carriage# followed the twenty mourning coaches and behind them more than five hundred #person# joined in the procession on #foot#
these last consisted of all the young #people# whom $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #death# had struck like a thunderbolt and who notwithstanding the raw chilliness of the season could not refrain from paying a last tribute to the memory of the beautiful chaste and adorable #girl# thus cut off in the flower of her youth
as they left paris an equipage with four #horse# at full speed was seen to draw up suddenly it contained $m_de_monte_cristo$
having crossed paris it passed through the faubourg du temple then leaving the exterior boulevards it reached the cemetery the #count# left the #carriage# and mingled in the crowd who followed on #foot#
the #count# looked attentively through every #opening# in the crowd he was evidently watching for someone but his search ended in disappointment
$baron_de_château_renaud$ perceived him and immediately alighting from his coupé joined him $m_beauchamp$ did the same where is $m_maximilian_morrel$
he asked do either of these #gentleman# know where he is we have already asked that #question# said $baron_de_château_renaud$ for none of us has seen him
the piercing #eye# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ glanced through clusters of bushes and #tree# and was soon relieved from all anxiety for seeing a #shadow# glide between the yew #tree# $m_de_monte_cristo$
the #count# was silent but continued to gaze around him at #length# they arrived at the cemetery recognized him whom he sought
black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues the #silence# of #earth# and heaven is alone broken by the #noise# made by the crackling branches of hedges planted around the monuments then follows the melancholy chant of the #priest# mingled now and then with a sob of anguish escaping from some #woman# concealed behind a mass of flowers
the #shadow# $m_de_monte_cristo$ had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of abélard and héloïse placed itself close to the #head# of the #horse# belonging to the hearse and following the undertaker #man# arrived with them at the #spot# appointed for the burial
#one# funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent metropolis each #person# #attention# was occupied $m_de_monte_cristo$ saw #nothing# but the #shadow# which no #one# else observed
twice the #count# left the ranks to see whether the object of his #interest# had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes
when the procession stopped this #shadow# was recognized as $m_maximilian_morrel$ who with his coat buttoned up to his throat his #face# livid and convulsively crushing his hat between his #finger# leaned against a #tree# situated on an elevation commanding the mausoleum so that none of the funeral details could escape his observation
a few #man# the least impressed of all by the #scene# pronounced a discourse some deploring this premature #death# #other# expatiating on the #grief# of the #father# and #one# very ingenious #person# quoting the #fact# that $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had solicited pardon of her #father# for criminals on whom the #arm# of #justice# was ready to fall until at #length# they exhausted their stores of metaphor and mournful speeches elaborate variations on the stanzas of malherbe to du périer
$m_de_monte_cristo$ heard and saw #nothing# or rather he only saw $m_maximilian_morrel$ whose calmness had a frightful #effect# on those who knew what was passing in his #heart#
#everything# was conducted in the usual #manner# see said $m_beauchamp$ pointing out $m_maximilian_morrel$ to $m_lucien_debray$ what is he doing up there
and they called $baron_de_château_renaud$ #attention# to him how pale he is said $baron_de_château_renaud$ shuddering he is cold said $m_lucien_debray$
not at all said $baron_de_château_renaud$ slowly i think he is violently agitated he is very susceptible bah said $m_lucien_debray$
he scarcely knew $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ you said so yourself true still i remember he danced three #time# with her at #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$
no i do not replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ without even knowing of what or to whom he was speaking so much was he occupied in watching $m_maximilian_morrel$ who was holding his breath with #emotion#
do you recollect that ball #count# where you produced such an #effect# the discourse is over farewell #gentleman# said the #count# unceremoniously
$baron_de_château_renaud$ looked for a #moment# for $m_maximilian_morrel$ but while they were watching the departure of the #count# $m_maximilian_morrel$ had quitted his post and $baron_de_château_renaud$ failing in his search joined $m_lucien_debray$ and $m_beauchamp$
$m_de_monte_cristo$ concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival of $m_maximilian_morrel$ who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators and workmen
$m_maximilian_morrel$ threw a #glance# around but before it reached the #spot# occupied by $m_de_monte_cristo$ the latter had advanced yet nearer still unperceived
and he disappeared without #anyone# seeing whither he went the funeral being over the #guest# returned to paris the young #man# knelt down
the #count# with outstretched neck and glaring #eye# stood in an attitude ready to pounce upon $m_maximilian_morrel$ upon the first occasion
$m_maximilian_morrel$ bent his #head# till it touched the #stone# then clutching the grating with both #hand# he murmured oh $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
the #count# #heart# was pierced by the utterance of these two #word# he stepped forward and touching the young #man# #shoulder# said i was looking for you my #friend#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ expected a burst of passion but he was deceived for $m_maximilian_morrel$ turning round said calmly you see i was praying
the scrutinizing #glance# of the #count# searched the young #man# from #head# to #foot# he then seemed more easy
shall i drive you back to paris he asked no #thank# you do you #wish# #anything# leave me to pray
the #count# withdrew without opposition but it was only to #place# himself in a situation where he could watch every movement of $m_maximilian_morrel$ who at #length# arose brushed the dust from his knees and turned towards paris without once looking back
he walked slowly down the rue de la roquette the #count# dismissing his #carriage# followed him about a hundred paces behind
$m_maximilian_morrel$ crossed the canal and entered the rue meslay by the boulevards five #minute# after the #door# had been closed on $m_maximilian_morrel$ entrance it was again opened for the #count#
$mademoiselle_julie$ was at the entrance of the #garden# where she was attentively watching $penelon$ who entering with zeal into his profession of gardener was very busy grafting some bengal roses
ah #count# she exclaimed with the delight manifested by every member of the #family# whenever he visited the rue meslay
$m_maximilian_morrel$ has just returned has he not #madame# asked the #count# yes i think i saw him pass but pray call $m_emmanuel$
excuse me #madame# but i must go up to $m_maximilian_morrel$ #room# this #instant# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ i have #something# of the greatest importance to tell him
$m_de_monte_cristo$ soon ran up the #staircase# conducting from the #ground# #floor# to $m_maximilian_morrel$ #room# when he reached the landing he listened attentively but all was still
like many old #house# occupied by a single #family# the #room# #door# was panelled with #glass# but it was locked $m_maximilian_morrel$ was shut in and it was impossible to see what was passing in the #room# because a red curtain was drawn before the #glass#
go then she said with a charming #smile# which accompanied him until he had disappeared the #count# anxiety was manifested by a bright color which seldom appeared on the #face# of that imperturbable #man#
no the #sound# of a bell announcing a visitor #will# but accelerate the resolution of #one# in $m_maximilian_morrel$ situation and then the bell would be followed by a louder #noise#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ trembled from #head# to #foot# and as if his determination had been taken with the rapidity of lightning he struck #one# of the panes of #glass# with his elbow the #glass# was shivered to atoms then withdrawing the curtain he saw $m_maximilian_morrel$ who had been writing at his desk bound from his #seat# at the #noise# of the broken #window#
i beg a thousand pardons said the #count# there is #nothing# the #matter# but i slipped down and broke #one# of your panes of #glass# with my elbow
what shall i do he uttered and reflected for a #moment# shall i ring since it is opened i #will# take advantage of it to enter your #room# do not disturb yourself
do not disturb yourself and passing his #hand# through the broken #glass# the #count# opened the #door# $m_maximilian_morrel$ evidently discomposed came to meet $m_de_monte_cristo$ less with the intention of receiving him than to exclude his entry
ma foi said $m_de_monte_cristo$ rubbing his elbow it all your #servant# fault your stairs are so polished it is like walking on #glass#
are you hurt #sir# coldly asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ i believe not but what are you about there you were writing
i your #finger# are stained with ink ah true i was writing i do sometimes #soldier# though i am
$m_de_monte_cristo$ advanced into the #room# $m_maximilian_morrel$ was obliged to let him pass but he followed him you were writing said $m_de_monte_cristo$ with a searching #look#
i have already had the #honor# of telling you i was said $m_maximilian_morrel$ the #count# looked around him your #pistol# are beside your desk said $m_de_monte_cristo$ pointing with his #finger# to the #pistol# on the #table#
i am on the #point# of starting on a journey replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ disdainfully my #friend# exclaimed $m_de_monte_cristo$ in a #tone# of exquisite sweetness
#sir# my #friend# my dear $m_maximilian_morrel$ do not make a hasty resolution i entreat you i make a hasty resolution said $m_maximilian_morrel$ shrugging his #shoulder# is there #anything# extraordinary in a journey
$m_maximilian_morrel$ said the #count# let us both lay aside the mask we have assumed you no more deceive me with that false calmness than i impose upon you with my frivolous solicitude
you can understand can you not that to have acted as i have done to have broken that #glass# to have intruded on the solitude of a #friend#
you can understand that to have done all this i must have been actuated by real uneasiness or rather by a terrible conviction
$m_maximilian_morrel$ you are going to destroy yourself indeed #count# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ shuddering what has put this into your #head#
i tell you that you are about to destroy yourself continued the #count# and here is #proof# of what i say and approaching the desk he removed the sheet of #paper# which $m_maximilian_morrel$ had placed over the #letter# he had begun and took the latter in his #hand#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ rushed forward to #tear# it from him but $m_de_monte_cristo$ perceiving his intention seized his wrist with his #iron# grasp
well said $m_maximilian_morrel$ changing his #expression# of calmness for #one# of violence well and if i do intend to #turn# this #pistol# against myself who shall prevent me who #will# dare prevent me
all my #hope# are blighted my #heart# is broken my #life# a burden #everything# around me is sad and mournful #earth# has become distasteful to me and human #voice# distract me
you #wish# to destroy yourself said the #count# you have written it it is a mercy to let me die for if i live i shall lose my #reason# and become mad
when #sir# i tell you all this with #tear# of heartfelt anguish can you reply that i am wrong can you prevent my putting an #end# to my miserable existence
tell me #sir# could you have the courage to do so yes $m_maximilian_morrel$ said $m_de_monte_cristo$ with a calmness which contrasted strangely with the young #man#
exclaimed $m_maximilian_morrel$ with increasing anger and reproach you who have deceived me with false #hope# who have cheered and soothed me with vain #promise#
excitement yes i would do so you when i might if not have saved her at least have seen her die in my #arm#
you who pretend to understand #everything# even the hidden sources of knowledge and who enact the #part# of a guardian angel upon #earth# and could not even find an antidote to a #poison# administered to a young #girl#
ah #sir# indeed you would inspire me with #pity# were you not hateful in my #eye# $m_maximilian_morrel$
when you spoke to me at the cemetery i answered you my #heart# was softened when you arrived here i allowed you to enter
but since you abuse my confidence since you have devised a new torture after i #thought# i had exhausted them all then #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ my pretended benefactor then #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ the universal guardian be satisfied you shall witness the #death# of your #friend# and $m_maximilian_morrel$ with a maniacal laugh again rushed towards the #pistol#
yes you tell me to lay aside the mask and i #will# do so be satisfied and i again repeat you shall not commit suicide
prevent me then replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ with another struggle which like the first failed in releasing him from the #count# #iron# grasp
i #will# prevent you and who are you then that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical #right# over free and rational beings
who am i repeated $m_de_monte_cristo$ listen i am the only #man# in the #world# having the #right# to say to you $m_maximilian_morrel$ your #father#
#son# shall not die #today# and $m_de_monte_cristo$ with an #expression# of majesty and sublimity advanced with #arm# folded toward the young #man# who involuntarily overcome by the commanding #manner# of this #man# recoiled a #step#
why do you mention my #father# stammered he why do you mingle a recollection of him with the #affair# of #today#
as you do #today# because i am the #man# who sent the purse to your young sister and the $pharaon$ to old $m_maximilian_morrel$ because i am the $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ who nursed you a #child# on my knees
$m_maximilian_morrel$ made another #step# back staggering breathless crushed then all his #strength# give #way# and he fell prostrate at the #foot# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
then his admirable #nature# underwent a complete and sudden revulsion he arose rushed out of the #room# and to the stairs exclaiming energetically $mademoiselle_julie$ julie $m_emmanuel$ emmanuel
$m_de_monte_cristo$ endeavored also to leave but $m_maximilian_morrel$ would have died rather than relax his hold of the handle of the #door# which he closed upon the #count#
because i am he who saved your #father# #life# when he wished to destroy himself $mademoiselle_julie$ $m_emmanuel$ and some of the #servant# ran up in alarm on hearing the #cry# of $m_maximilian_morrel$
$m_maximilian_morrel$ seized their #hand# and #opening# the #door# exclaimed in a #voice# choked with sobs on your knees on your knees
he is our benefactor the saviour of our #father# he is he would have added $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ but the #count# seized his #arm# and prevented him
$mademoiselle_julie$ threw herself into the #arm# of the #count# $m_emmanuel$ embraced him as a guardian angel $m_maximilian_morrel$ again fell on his knees and struck the #ground# with his #forehead#
then the #iron# hearted #man# felt his #heart# swell in his breast a flame seemed to rush from his throat to his #eye# he bent his #head# and wept
for a while #nothing# was heard in the #room# but a succession of sobs while the incense from their grateful #heart# mounted to heaven
$mademoiselle_julie$ had scarcely recovered from her deep #emotion# when she rushed out of the #room# descended to the next #floor# ran into the #drawing# #room# with childlike #joy# and raised the crystal globe which covered the purse given by the unknown of the allées de meilhan
oh #count# how could you hearing us so often speak of our unknown benefactor seeing us pay such homage of gratitude and adoration to his memory how could you continue so long without discovering yourself to us
meanwhile $m_emmanuel$ in a broken #voice# said to the #count# oh it was cruel to us and dare i say it to
since we have really been #friend# for the last eleven #year# the discovery of this #secret# has been occasioned by a great #event# which you must never know
i wished to bury it during my whole #life# in my own bosom but your #brother# $m_maximilian_morrel$ wrested it from me by a violence he repents of now i am sure
then turning around and seeing that $m_maximilian_morrel$ still on his knees had thrown himself into an armchair he added in a low #voice# pressing $m_emmanuel$ #hand# significantly
you also listen my #friend# said the #count# i may call you so watch over him why so
$m_emmanuel$ looked around the #room# and caught #sight# of the #pistol# his #eye# rested on the weapons and he pointed to them
asked the young #man# surprised i cannot explain myself but watch over him $m_de_monte_cristo$ bent his #head# $m_emmanuel$ went towards the #pistol#
then walking towards $m_maximilian_morrel$ he took his #hand# the tumultuous agitation of the young #man# was succeeded by a profound stupor
$mademoiselle_julie$ returned holding the silken purse in her #hand# while #tear# of #joy# rolled down her cheeks like dewdrops on the rose
leave them said $m_de_monte_cristo$ here is the relic she said do not think it #will# be less dear to us
now we are acquainted with our benefactor my #child# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ coloring allow me to take back that purse
since you now know my #face# i #wish# to be remembered alone through the affection i #hope# you #will# grant me
oh said $mademoiselle_julie$ pressing the purse to her #heart# no no i beseech you do not take it for some unhappy #day# you #will# leave us #will# you not
in a week i shall have left this #country# where so many #person# who merit the vengeance of heaven lived happily while my #father# perished of hunger and #grief#
while announcing his departure the #count# fixed his #eye# on $m_maximilian_morrel$ and remarked that the #word# i shall have left this #country# had failed to rouse him from his lethargy
he then saw that he must make another struggle against the #grief# of his #friend# and taking the #hand# of $m_emmanuel$ and $mademoiselle_julie$ which he pressed within his own he said with the mild authority of a #father#
you have guessed rightly #madame# replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ smiling my kind #friend# leave me alone with $m_maximilian_morrel$
$mademoiselle_julie$ saw the #mean# offered of carrying off her precious relic which $m_de_monte_cristo$ had forgotten she drew her #husband# to the #door#
let us leave them she said the #count# was alone with $m_maximilian_morrel$ who remained motionless as a statue come said $m_de_monte_cristo$ touching his #shoulder# with his #finger# are you a #man# again $m_maximilian_morrel$
yes for i begin to suffer again the #count# frowned apparently in gloomy hesitation $m_maximilian_morrel$ maximilian he said
the #idea# you yield to are unworthy of a christian oh do not #fear# my #friend# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ raising his #head# and smiling with a sweet #expression# on the #count#
i shall no longer attempt my #life# then we are to have no more #pistol# no more #despair#
no i have found a better remedy for my #grief# than either a bullet or a knife poor #fellow# what is it
my #grief# #will# kill me of itself my #friend# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ with an #expression# of melancholy equal to his own listen to me
#one# #day# in a #moment# of #despair# like yours since it led to a similar resolution i also wished to kill myself #one# #day# your #father# equally desperate wished to kill himself too
if #anyone# had told me when in my #prison# i pushed back the food i had not tasted for three #day# if #anyone# had said to either of us then
the #day# #will# come when you #will# be happy and #will# bless #life# no #matter# whose #voice# had spoken we should have heard him with the #smile# of #doubt# or the anguish of incredulity and yet how many #time# has your #father# blessed #life# while embracing you
if #anyone# had said to your #father# at the #moment# he raised the #pistol# to his #head# live
ah exclaimed $m_maximilian_morrel$ interrupting the #count# you had only lost your #liberty# my #father# had only lost his #fortune# but i have lost $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
how often have i myself #look# at me said $m_de_monte_cristo$ with that #expression# which sometimes made him so eloquent and persuasive #look# at me
there are no #tear# in my #eye# nor is there fever in my veins yet i see you suffer you $m_maximilian_morrel$ whom i #love# as my own #son#
well does not this tell you that in #grief# as in #life# there is always #something# to #look# forward to beyond
now if i entreat if i #order# you to live $m_maximilian_morrel$ it is in the conviction that #one# #day# you #will# #thank# me for having preserved your #life#
oh heavens said the young #man# oh heavens what are you saying #count# take #care# but perhaps you have never loved
#child# replied the #count# i #mean# as i #love# you see i have been a #soldier# ever since i attained manhood
i reached the #age# of twenty nine without loving for none of the #feeling# i before then experienced merit the appellation of #love#
well at twenty nine i saw $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ for two #year# i have loved her for two #year# i have seen written in her #heart# as in a book all the virtues of a #daughter# and #wife#
#count# to possess $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ would have been a #happiness# too infinite too ecstatic too complete too divine for this #world# since it has been denied me but without $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ the #earth# is desolate
then have a #care# i repeat for you seek to persuade me and if you succeed i should lose my #reason# for i should #hope# that i could again behold $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
my #friend# my #father# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ with excitement have a #care# i again repeat for the #power# you wield over me alarms me
weigh your #word# before you speak for my #eye# have already become brighter and my #heart# beats strongly be cautious or you #will# make me believe in supernatural agencies
i have told you to #hope# said the #count# the #count# smiled i must obey you though you bade me call forth the dead or walk upon the #water#
ah said $m_maximilian_morrel$ falling from the height of excitement to the abyss of #despair# ah you are playing with me like those good or rather selfish #mother# who soothe their #child# with honeyed #word# because their screams annoy them
no my #friend# i was wrong to caution you do not #fear# i #will# bury my #grief# so deep in my #heart# i #will# disguise it so that you shall not even #care# to sympathize with me
#hope# my #friend# repeated the #count# adieu my #friend# adieu on the #contrary# said the #count# after this #time# you must live with me
you must not leave me and in a week we shall have left france behind us and you still bid me #hope#
i tell you to #hope# because i have a method of curing you #count# you render me sadder than before if it be possible
you think the result of this blow has been to produce an ordinary #grief# and you would cure it by an ordinary remedy change of #scene#
i have confidence in the remedy i propose and only ask you to permit me to assure you of its efficacy
and $m_maximilian_morrel$ dropped his #head# with disdainful incredulity what can i say more asked $m_de_monte_cristo$
#count# you prolong my agony then said the #count# your feeble spirit #will# not even grant me the trial i request
come do you know of what the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ is capable do you know that he holds terrestrial beings under his control
nay that he can almost #work# a miracle well wait for the miracle i #hope# to accomplish or or repeated $m_maximilian_morrel$
or take #care# $m_maximilian_morrel$ lest i call you ungrateful have #pity# on me #count# i feel so much #pity# towards you $m_maximilian_morrel$ that listen to me
attentively if i do not cure you in a #month# to the #day# to the very #hour# mark my #word# $m_maximilian_morrel$ i #will# #place# loaded #pistol# before you and a cup of the deadliest italian #poison# a #poison# more sure and prompt than that which has killed $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
yes for i am a #man# and have suffered like yourself and also contemplated suicide indeed often since #misfortune# has left me i have longed for the delights of an eternal sleep
#will# you #promise# me but you are sure you #will# #promise# me this said $m_maximilian_morrel$ intoxicated
in a #month# then on your #honor# if i am not consoled you #will# let me take my #life# into my own #hand# and whatever may happen you #will# not call me ungrateful
i not only #promise# but swear it said $m_de_monte_cristo$ extending his #hand# in a #month# to the #day# the very #hour# and the date is a sacred #one# $m_maximilian_morrel$
i do not know whether you remember that this is the th of september it is ten #year# #today# since i saved your #father#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ seized the #count# #hand# and kissed it the #count# allowed him to pay the homage he felt due to him
in a #month# you #will# find on the #table# at which we shall be then sitting good #pistol# and a delicious draught but on the #other# #hand# you must #promise# me not to attempt your #life# before that #time#
#life# who wished to die oh i also swear it $m_de_monte_cristo$ drew the young #man# towards him and pressed him for some #time# to his #heart#
and now he said after #today# you #will# come and live with me you can occupy $haydée$ #apartment# and my #daughter# #will# at least be replaced by my #son#
$haydée$ said $m_maximilian_morrel$ what has become of her she departed last #night# to leave you to wait for me
hold yourself ready then to join me at the champs élysées and lead me out of this $house_of_peers$ without #anyone# seeing my departure
the #apartment# on the first #floor# of the $house_of_peers$ in the rue saint germain des prés where $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had selected a home for his #mother# was let to a very mysterious #person#
this was a #man# whose #face# the concierge himself had never seen for in the winter his chin was buried in #one# of the large red handkerchiefs worn by #gentleman# coachmen on a cold #night# and in the summer he made a #point# of always blowing his nose just as he approached the #door#
#contrary# to custom this #gentleman# had not been watched for as the report ran that he was a #person# of high rank and #one# who would allow no impertinent interference his incognito was strictly respected
his #visit# were tolerably regular though occasionally he appeared a little before or after his #time# but generally both in summer and winter he took #possession# of his #apartment# about four clock though he never spent the #night# there
at #half# past three in the winter the #fire# was lighted by the discreet #servant# who had the superintendence of the little #apartment# and in the summer ices were placed on the #table# at the same #hour#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ hung his #head# and obeyed with childlike reverence #chapter# dividing the proceeds at four clock as we have already stated the mysterious personage arrived
twenty #minute# afterwards a #carriage# stopped at the $house_of_peers$ a #lady# alighted in a black or dark blue dress and always thickly veiled she passed like a #shadow# through the lodge and ran upstairs without a #sound# escaping under the touch of her #light# #foot#
her #face# therefore like that of the #gentleman# was perfectly unknown to the two concierges who were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for discretion
then she tapped in a peculiar #manner# at a #door# which after being opened to admit her was again fastened and curiosity penetrated no farther
no #one# ever asked her where she was going we need not say she stopped at the first #floor# they used the same precautions in leaving as in entering the $house_of_peers$
the #lady# always left first and as soon as she had stepped into her #carriage# it drove away sometimes towards the #right# #hand# sometimes to the left then about twenty #minute# afterwards the #gentleman# would also leave buried in his cravat or concealed by his handkerchief
the #day# after $m_de_monte_cristo$ had called upon $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ the mysterious lodger entered at ten clock in the #morning# instead of four in the afternoon
almost directly afterwards without the usual interval of #time# a cab arrived and the veiled #lady# ran hastily upstairs the #door# opened but before it could be closed the #lady# exclaimed
the concierge therefore heard for the first #time# that the lodger #name# was $m_lucien_debray$ still as he was the very perfection of a #door# keeper he made up his #mind# not to tell his #wife#
well what is the #matter# my dear asked the #gentleman# whose #name# the #lady# agitation revealed tell me what is the #matter#
oh $m_lucien_debray$ oh my #friend# oh $m_lucien_debray$ can i confide in you of #course# you know you can do so
but what can be the #matter# your #note# of this #morning# has completely bewildered me this precipitation this unusual appointment come ease me of my anxiety or else frighten me at once
$m_lucien_debray$ a great #event# has happened said the #lady# glancing inquiringly at $m_lucien_debray$ $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ left last #night# left $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ left
where has he gone i do not know what do you #mean# has he gone intending not to #return#
undoubtedly at ten clock at #night# his #horse# took him to the barrier of charenton there a post chaise was waiting for him
he entered it with his #valet# de chambre saying that he was going to fontainebleau then what did you #mean#
stay he left a #letter# for me a #letter# yes read it and the #baroness# took from her #pocket# a #letter# which she gave to $m_lucien_debray$
$m_lucien_debray$ paused a #moment# before reading as if trying to guess its contents or perhaps while making up his #mind# how to act whatever it might contain
no #doubt# his #idea# were arranged in a few #minute# for he began reading the #letter# which caused so much uneasiness in the #heart# of the #baroness# and which ran as follows
#madame# and most faithful #wife# $m_lucien_debray$ mechanically stopped and looked at the #baroness# whose #face# became covered with blushes
oh you need not be alarmed you #will# only have lost him as you have lost your #daughter# i #mean# that i shall be travelling on #one# of the thirty or forty #road# leading out of france
i owe you some explanations for my conduct and as you are a #woman# that can perfectly understand me i #will# give them
read she said $m_lucien_debray$ continued when you receive this you #will# no longer have a #husband# listen then
i received this #morning# five #million# which i paid away almost directly afterwards another demand for the same #sum# was presented to me i put this creditor off till #tomorrow#
and i intend leaving #today# to escape that #tomorrow# which would be rather too unpleasant for me to endure you understand this do you not my most precious #wife#
i say you understand this because you are as conversant with my #affair# as i am indeed i think you understand them better since i am ignorant of what has become of a considerable portion of my #fortune# once very tolerable while i am sure #madame# that you know perfectly well
for #woman# have infallible instincts they can even explain the marvellous by an algebraic calculation they have invented but i who only understand my own figures know #nothing# more than that #one# #day# these figures deceived me
have you admired the rapidity of my fall have you been slightly dazzled at the sudden fusion of my ingots i confess i have seen #nothing# but the #fire# let us #hope# you have found some #gold# among the ashes
with this consoling #idea# i leave you #madame# and most prudent #wife# without any conscientious reproach for abandoning you you have #friend# left and the ashes i have already mentioned and above all the #liberty# i hasten to restore to you
so long as i hoped you were working for the good of our $house_of_peers$ and for the #fortune# of our #daughter# i philosophically closed my #eye# but as you have transformed that $house_of_peers$ into a vast ruin i #will# not be the foundation of another #man#
and here #madame# i must add another #word# of explanation #fortune# you were rich when i married you but little respected
excuse me for speaking so very candidly but as this is intended only for ourselves i do not see why i should weigh my #word#
i have augmented our #fortune# and it has continued to increase during the last fifteen #year# till extraordinary and unexpected catastrophes have suddenly overturned it without any fault of mine i can honestly declare
you #madame# have only sought to increase your own and i am convinced that you have succeeded i leave you therefore as i took you rich but little respected
adieu i also intend from this #time# to #work# on my own #account# accept my acknowledgments for the example you have set me and which i intend following
the #baroness# had watched $m_lucien_debray$ while he read this long and painful #letter# and saw him notwithstanding his self control change color once or twice
your very devoted #husband# #baron# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ when he had ended the perusal he folded the #letter# and resumed his pensive attitude
well asked #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with an anxiety easy to be understood well #madame# unhesitatingly repeated $m_lucien_debray$ with what #idea# does that #letter# inspire you
oh it is simple enough #madame# it inspires me with the #idea# that $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ has left suspiciously
certainly but is this all you have to say to me i do not understand you said $m_lucien_debray$ with freezing coldness
he is gone gone never to #return# oh #madame# do not think that i tell you he #will# never #return#
if he could have made any #use# of me he would have taken me with him he leaves me in paris as our separation #will# conduce to his benefit therefore he has gone and i am free forever added #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ in the same supplicating #tone#
i know his character he is inflexible in any resolutions formed for his own #interest# $m_lucien_debray$ instead of answering allowed her to remain in an attitude of nervous inquiry
well she said at #length# do you not #answer# me i have but #one# #question# to ask you what
do you intend to do i was going to ask you replied the #baroness# with a beating #heart#
ah then you #wish# to ask advice of me yes i do #wish# to ask your advice said #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with anxious expectation
then if you #wish# to take my advice said the young #man# coldly i would recommend you to travel
in my #opinion# a withdrawal from paris is absolutely necessary after the double catastrophe of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ broken contract and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ disappearance
the #world# #will# think you abandoned and poor for the #wife# of a bankrupt would never be forgiven were she to keep up an #appearance# of opulence
you have only to remain in paris for about a fortnight telling the #world# you are abandoned and relating the details of this desertion to your best #friend# who #will# soon spread the report
then you can quit your $house_of_peers$ leaving your jewels and giving up your jointure and #everyone# mouth #will# be filled with praises of your disinterestedness
they #will# know you are deserted and think you also poor for i alone know your real financial #position# and am quite ready to give up my #account# as an honest partner
the dread with which the pale and motionless #baroness# listened to this was equalled by the calm indifference with which $m_lucien_debray$ had spoken
to travel she murmured certainly as $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ says you are rich and perfectly free deserted she repeated
ah yes i am indeed deserted you are #right# #sir# and no #one# can #doubt# my #position# these were the only #word# that this proud and violently enamoured #woman# could utter in response to $m_lucien_debray$
but then you are rich very rich indeed continued $m_lucien_debray$ taking out some #paper# from his #pocket# book which he spread upon the #table#
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ did not see them she was engaged in stilling the beatings of her #heart# and restraining the #tear# which were ready to gush forth
at #length# a sense of dignity prevailed and if she did not entirely #master# her agitation she at least succeeded in preventing the fall of a single #tear#
#madame# said $m_lucien_debray$ it is nearly six #month# since we have been associated you furnished a principal of #franc#
our partnership began in the #month# of april in may we commenced operations and in the #course# of the #month# gained #franc#
in june the profit amounted to in july we added #franc# it was you know the #month# of the spanish bonds
in august we lost #franc# at the beginning of the #month# but on the th we made up for it and we now find that our #account# reckoning from the first #day# of partnership up to #yesterday# when i closed them showed a capital of #franc# that is for each of us
now #madame# said $m_lucien_debray$ delivering up his #account# in the methodical #manner# of a stockbroker there are still #franc# the #interest# of this #money# in my #hand#
but said the #baroness# i #thought# you never put the #money# out to #interest# excuse me #madame# said $m_lucien_debray$ coldly
there are then #franc# for your share besides the you furnished me to begin with making in all #franc# for your portion
now #madame# i took the precaution of #drawing# out your #money# the #day# before #yesterday# it is not long ago you see and i was in continual expectation of being called on to deliver up my #account#
i had your permission to do so and i have made #use# of it there is your #money# #half# in bank #note# the #other# #half# in checks payable to bearer
i say there for as i did not consider my $house_of_peers$ safe enough or lawyers sufficiently discreet and as landed property carries evidence with it and moreover since you have no #right# to possess #anything# independent of your #husband# i have kept this #sum# now your whole #fortune# in a chest concealed under that closet and for greater security i myself concealed it there
now #madame# continued $m_lucien_debray$ first #opening# the closet then the chest now #madame# here are #note# of #franc# each resembling as you see a large book bound in #iron#
to this i add a certificate in the funds of #franc# then for the odd cash making i think about #franc# here is a check upon my #banker# who not being $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #will# pay you the amount you may #rest# assured
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ mechanically took the check the bond and the heap of bank #note# this enormous #fortune# made no great #appearance# on the #table#
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with tearless #eye# but with her breast heaving with concealed #emotion# placed the bank #note# in her bag put the certificate and check into her #pocket# book and then standing pale and mute awaited #one# kind #word# of consolation
you have a splendid #fortune# an income of about livres a #year# which is enormous for a #woman# who cannot keep an establishment here for a #year# at least
you #will# be able to indulge all your fancies besides should you find your income insufficient you can for the sake of the past #madame# make #use# of mine and i am ready to offer you all i possess on loan
you forget that what you have just paid me is much more than a poor #woman# requires who intends for some #time# at least to retire from the #world#
but she waited in vain now #madame# said $m_lucien_debray$ #thank# you #sir# #thank# you replied the #baroness#
$m_lucien_debray$ was for a #moment# surprised but immediately recovering himself he bowed with an #air# which seemed to say as you please #madame#
#madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had until then perhaps hoped for #something# but when she saw the careless bow of $m_lucien_debray$ and the #glance# by which it was accompanied together with his significant #silence# she raised her #head# and without passion or violence or even hesitation ran downstairs disdaining to address a last farewell to #one# who could thus #part# from her
she #will# remain at home read novels and speculate at cards since she can no longer do so on the bourse
then taking up his #account# book he cancelled with the greatest #care# all the entries of the amounts he had just paid away
bah said $m_lucien_debray$ when she had left these are fine projects i have #franc# remaining he said
what a #pity# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ is dead she suited me in every respect and i would have married her
and he calmly waited until the twenty #minute# had elapsed after #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ departure before he left the $house_of_peers$ during this #time# he occupied himself in making figures with his watch by his #side#
asmodeus that diabolical personage who would have been created by every fertile imagination if le sage had not acquired the priority in his great masterpiece would have enjoyed a singular spectacle if he had lifted up the roof of the little $house_of_peers$ in the rue saint germain des prés while $m_lucien_debray$ was casting up his figures
above the #room# in which $m_lucien_debray$ had been dividing two #million# and a #half# with #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was another inhabited by #person# who have played too prominent a #part# in the incidents we have related for their #appearance# not to create some #interest#
$mercédès$ was much changed within the last few #day# not that even in her #day# of #fortune# she had ever dressed with the magnificent display which makes us no longer able to recognize a #woman# when she appears in a plain and simple attire nor indeed had she fallen into that state of depression where it is impossible to conceal the garb of misery no the change in $mercédès$ was that her #eye# no longer sparkled her #lip# no longer smiled and there was now a hesitation in uttering the #word# which formerly sprang so fluently from her ready wit
it was not poverty which had broken her spirit it was not a want of courage which rendered her poverty burdensome
$mercédès$ although deposed from the exalted #position# she had occupied lost in the sphere she had now chosen like a #person# passing from a #room# splendidly lighted into utter #darkness# appeared like a queen fallen from her palace to a hovel and who reduced to strict necessity could neither become reconciled to the earthen #vessel# she was herself forced to #place# upon the #table# nor to the humble pallet which had become her #bed#
the beautiful catalane and noble #countess# had lost both her proud #glance# and charming #smile# because she saw #nothing# but misery around her the #wall# were hung with #one# of the gray #paper# which economical landlords choose as not likely to show the dirt the #floor# was uncarpeted the furniture attracted the #attention# to the poor attempt at luxury indeed #everything# offended #eye# accustomed to refinement and elegance
#madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had lived there since leaving her $house_of_peers$ the continual #silence# of the #spot# oppressed her still seeing that $m_albert_de_morcerf$ continually watched her #countenance# to judge the state of her #feeling# she constrained herself to assume a monotonous #smile# of the #lip# alone which contrasted with the sweet and beaming #expression# that usually shone from her #eye# seemed like moonlight on a statue yielding #light# without warmth
$mercédès$ and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ were in that #room# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ too was ill at ease the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking into his actual #position#
if he wished to go out without gloves his #hand# appeared too white if he wished to walk through the town his boots seemed too highly polished
yet these two noble and intelligent creatures united by the indissoluble ties of maternal and filial #love# had succeeded in tacitly understanding #one# another and economizing their stores and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had been able to tell his #mother# without extorting a change of #countenance#
$mercédès$ had never known misery she had often in her youth spoken of poverty but between want and necessity those synonymous #word# there is a wide difference
#mother# we have no more #money# amongst the catalans $mercédès$ wished for a thousand #thing# but still she never really wanted any
so long as the nets were good they caught fish and so long as they sold their fish they were able to buy twine for new nets
and then shut out from friendship having but #one# affection which could not be mixed up with her ordinary pursuits she #thought# of herself of no #one# but herself
upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could now there were two to be supported and #nothing# to live upon
she who was accustomed to stoves which heated the $house_of_peers$ from the hall to the boudoir she had not even #one# little flower
winter approached $mercédès$ had no #fire# in that cold and naked #room# she whose #apartment# had been a conservatory of costly exotics
but she had her #son# hitherto the excitement of fulfilling a #duty# had sustained them excitement like enthusiasm sometimes renders us unconscious to the #thing# of #earth#
but the excitement had calmed down and they felt themselves obliged to descend from #dream# to reality after having exhausted the ideal they found they must talk of the actual
#mother# exclaimed $m_albert_de_morcerf$ just as #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was descending the stairs let us reckon our riches if you please i want capital to build my #plan# upon
capital #nothing# replied $mercédès$ with a mournful #smile# no #mother# capital #franc# and i have an #idea# of our leading a delightful #life# upon this #franc#
alas dear #mother# said the young #man# i have unhappily spent too much of your #money# not to know the value of it
#child# sighed $mercédès$ these #franc# are enormous and i intend building upon this foundation a miraculous certainty for the future
you say this my dear #boy# but do you think we ought to accept these #franc# said $mercédès$ coloring
we #will# accept them the more readily since we have them not here you know they are buried in the #garden# of the little $house_of_peers$ in the allées de meilhan at marseilles
i think so answered $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in a firm #tone# with #franc# we can reach marseilles with #franc# are
you sure $m_albert_de_morcerf$ oh as for that i have made inquiries respecting the diligences and steamboats and my calculations are made
you #will# take your #place# in the coupé to châlons you see #mother# i treat you handsomely for thirty five #franc#
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ then took a pen and wrote frs coupé thirty five #franc# from châlons to lyons you #will# go on by the steamboat
from lyons to avignon still by steamboat from avignon to marseilles seven #franc# expenses on the #road# about fifty #franc#
total frs let us put down added $m_albert_de_morcerf$ smiling you see i am generous am i not #mother#
but you my poor #child# i do you not see that i reserve eighty #franc# for myself a young #man# does not require luxuries besides i know what travelling is
with a post chaise and #valet# de chambre any #way# #mother# well be it so but these #franc#
here they are and more besides see i have sold my watch for #franc# and the guard and seals for
now i think we are rich since instead of the #franc# we require for the journey we find ourselves in #possession# of
how fortunate that the ornaments were worth more than the watch still the same #story# of superfluities but we owe #something# in this $house_of_peers$
thirty #franc# but i pay that out of my #franc# that is understood and as i require only eighty #franc# for my journey
and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ took out of a little #pocket# book with golden clasps a remnant of his old fancies or perhaps a tender souvenir from #one# of the mysterious and veiled #lady# who used to knock at his little #door# $m_albert_de_morcerf$ took out of this #pocket# book a #note# of #franc#
you see i am overwhelmed with luxury but that is not all what do you say to this #mother#
what is this asked $mercédès$ a thousand #franc# but whence have you obtained them listen to me #mother# and do not yield too much to agitation
you cannot imagine #mother# how beautiful i think you said the young #man# impressed with a profound #feeling# of filial #love#
and $m_albert_de_morcerf$ rising kissed his #mother# on both cheeks then stood looking at her you are indeed the most beautiful and most noble #woman# i ever saw
dear #child# said $mercédès$ endeavoring in vain to restrain a #tear# which glistened in the #corner# of her #eye#
indeed you only wanted #misfortune# to change my #love# for you to admiration i am not unhappy while i possess my #son#
ah just so said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ here begins the trial do you know the decision we have come to #mother#
yes it is decided that you are to live at marseilles and that i am to leave for africa where i #will# earn for myself the #right# to #use# the #name# i now bear instead of the #one# i have thrown aside
well #mother# i #yesterday# engaged myself as substitute in the spahis added the young #man# lowering his #eye# with a certain #feeling# of shame for even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his self abasement
have we come to any $mercédès$ sighed i #thought# my #body# was my own and that i might sell it
i #yesterday# took the #place# of another i sold myself for more than i #thought# i was worth he added attempting to #smile# i fetched #franc#
then these #franc# said $mercédès$ shuddering are the #half# of the #sum# #mother# the #other# #will# be paid in a #year#
$mercédès$ raised her #eye# to heaven with an #expression# it would be impossible to describe and #tear# which had hitherto been restrained now yielded to her #emotion# and ran down her cheeks
but i assure you #mother# i have a strong intention of defending my #person# and i never felt #half# so strong an inclination to live as i do now
the price of his #blood# she murmured yes if i am killed said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ laughing merciful heavens
besides #mother# why should you make up your #mind# that i am to be killed has lamoricière that ney of the south been killed
has changarnier been killed has bedeau been killed has $m_maximilian_morrel$ whom we know been killed think of your #joy# #mother# when you see me #return# with an embroidered uniform
$mercédès$ sighed while endeavoring to #smile# the devoted #mother# felt that she ought not to allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall upon her #son#
i declare i expect to #look# magnificent in it and chose that regiment only from vanity well now you understand #mother#
continued $m_albert_de_morcerf$ here are more than #franc# settled on you upon these you can live at least two #year#
these #word# were uttered in so mournful a #tone# that their real meaning did not escape $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he felt his #heart# beat and taking his #mother# #hand# within his own he said tenderly
do you think so said $mercédès$ yes you #will# live i shall live then you #will# not leave me $m_albert_de_morcerf$
#mother# i must go said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ in a firm calm #voice# you #love# me too well to #wish# me to remain useless and idle with you besides i have signed
you #will# obey your own #wish# and the #will# of heaven not my own #wish# #mother# but #reason# necessity
what is #life# to me very little without you #mother# for believe me but for you i should have ceased to live on the #day# i doubted my #father# and renounced his #name#
well i #will# live if you #promise# me still to #hope# and if you grant me the #care# of your future prospects you #will# redouble my #strength#
then i #will# go to the #governor# of algeria he has a royal #heart# and is essentially a #soldier# i #will# tell him my gloomy #story#
i #will# beg him to #turn# his #eye# now and then towards me and if he keep his #word# and #interest# himself for me in six #month# i shall be an #officer# or dead
if i am an #officer# your #fortune# is certain for i shall have #money# enough for both and moreover a #name# we shall both be proud of since it #will# be our own
are we not two despairing creatures what is #life# to you #nothing# if i am killed well then #mother# you can also die and there #will# be an #end# of our #misfortune#
it is well replied $mercédès$ with her eloquent #glance# you are #right# my #love# let us prove to those who are watching our actions that we are worthy of compassion
but let us not yield to gloomy apprehensions said the young #man# i assure you we are or rather we shall be very happy
you are a #woman# at once full of spirit and resignation i have become simple in my tastes and am without passion i #hope#
once in #service# i shall be rich once in $m_dantès$ $house_of_peers$ you #will# be at #rest# let us strive i beseech you let us strive to be cheerful
yes let us strive for you ought to live and to be happy $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and so our division is made #mother# said the young #man# affecting ease of #mind#
we can now #part# come i shall engage your passage and you my dear #boy# i shall stay here for a few #day# longer we must accustom ourselves to parting
i want recommendations and some information relative to africa i #will# join you again at marseilles well be it so
let us #part# said $mercédès$ folding around her #shoulder# the only shawl she had taken away and which accidentally happened to be a valuable black cashmere
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ gathered up his #paper# hastily rang the bell to pay the thirty #franc# he owed to the landlord and offering his #arm# to his #mother# they descended the stairs
someone was walking down before them and this #person# hearing the rustling of a silk dress turned around $m_lucien_debray$
muttered $m_albert_de_morcerf$ you $m_albert_de_morcerf$ replied the secretary resting on the stairs curiosity had vanquished the #desire# of preserving his incognito and he was recognized
it was indeed strange in this unknown #spot# to find the young #man# whose #misfortune# had made so much #noise# in paris
$m_albert_de_morcerf$ repeated $m_lucien_debray$ then noticing in the dim #light# the still youthful and veiled figure of #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$
pardon me he added with a #smile# i leave you $m_albert_de_morcerf$ albert understood his #thought# #mother# he said turning towards $mercédès$
this is $m_lucien_debray$ secretary of the #minister# for the interior once a #friend# of mine how once stammered $m_lucien_debray$
what do you #mean# i say so $m_lucien_debray$ because i have no #friend# now and i ought not to have any
i #thank# you for having recognized me #sir# $m_lucien_debray$ stepped forward and cordially pressed the #hand# of his interlocutor
believe me dear $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he said with all the #emotion# he was capable of #feeling# believe me i feel deeply for your #misfortune# and if in any #way# i can serve you i am yours
#thank# you #sir# said $m_albert_de_morcerf$ smiling in the midst of our #misfortune# we are still rich enough not to require assistance from #anyone#
the #blood# mounted to the temples of $m_lucien_debray$ who held a #million# in his #pocket# book and unimaginative as he was he could not help reflecting that the same $house_of_peers$ had contained two #woman# #one# of whom justly dishonored had left it poor with #franc# under her cloak while the #other# unjustly stricken but sublime in her #misfortune# was yet rich with a few deniers
this parallel disturbed his usual politeness the philosophy he witnessed appalled him he muttered a few #word# of general civility and ran downstairs
we are leaving paris and when our journey is paid we shall have #franc# left that #day# the #minister# clerks and the subordinates had a great deal to put up with from his ill humor
but that same #night# he found himself the possessor of a fine $house_of_peers$ situated on the boulevard de la madeleine and an income of livres
the next #day# just as $m_lucien_debray$ was signing the deed that is about five clock in the afternoon #madame# de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ after having affectionately embraced her #son# entered the coupé of the diligence which closed upon her
a #man# was hidden in lafitte banking $house_of_peers$ behind #one# of the little arched #window# which are placed above each desk he saw $mercédès$ enter the diligence and he also saw $m_albert_de_morcerf$ withdraw
then he passed his #hand# across his #forehead# which was clouded with #doubt# alas he exclaimed how can i restore the #happiness# i have taken away from these poor innocent creatures
the lions den #one# division of la force in which the most dangerous and desperate #prisoner# are confined is called the #court# of saint bernard
god help me #chapter# the #prisoner# in their expressive language have named it the lions den probably because the captives possess teeth which frequently gnaw the bars and sometimes the keepers also
the gratings are every #day# carefully examined by #jailer# whose herculean proportions and cold pitiless #expression# prove them to have been chosen to reign over their #subject# for their superior activity and intelligence
the courtyard of this #quarter# is enclosed by enormous #wall# over which the sun #glance# obliquely when it deigns to penetrate into this gulf of moral and physical deformity
on this paved yard are to be seen pacing to and fro from #morning# till #night# pale careworn and haggard like so many #shadow# the #man# whom #justice# holds beneath the steel she is sharpening
there crouched against the #side# of the #wall# which attracts and retains the most heat they may be seen sometimes talking to #one# another but more frequently alone watching the #door# which sometimes opens to call forth #one# from the gloomy assemblage or to throw in another outcast from society
the #court# of saint bernard has its own particular #apartment# for the reception of #guest# it is a long rectangle divided by two upright gratings placed at a #distance# of three #foot# from #one# another to prevent a visitor from shaking #hand# with or passing #anything# to the #prisoner#
it is a wretched damp nay even horrible #spot# more especially when we consider the agonizing conferences which have taken #place# between those #iron# bars
and yet frightful though this #spot# may be it is looked upon as a kind of paradise by the #man# whose #day# are numbered it is so rare for them to leave the lions den for any #other# #place# than the barrier saint jacques the galleys or solitary confinement
in the #court# which we have attempted to describe and from which a damp vapor was rising a young #man# with his #hand# in his #pocket# who had excited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the den might be seen walking
the cut of his clothes would have made him pass for an elegant #man# if those clothes had not been torn to shreds still they did not show #sign# of wear and the fine cloth beneath the careful #hand# of the #prisoner# soon recovered its gloss in the #part# which were still perfect for the wearer tried his best to make it assume the #appearance# of a new coat
he bestowed the same #attention# upon the cambric front of a shirt which had considerably changed in color since his entrance into the #prison# and he polished his varnished boots with the #corner# of a handkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by a coronet
it is a #prison# within a #prison# the #wall# are double the thickness of the #rest# some of the inmates of the lions den were watching the operations of the #prisoner# toilet with considerable #interest#
see the prince is pluming himself said #one# of the thieves he a fine looking #fellow# said another
if he had only a comb and #hair# grease he take the shine off the #gentleman# in white kids his coat #look# almost new and his boots shine like a nigger #face#
it pleasant to have such well dressed comrades but didnt those gendarmes behave shameful must a been jealous to #tear# such clothes
he #look# like a big bug said another dresses in fine style and then to be here so young oh what larks
meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket against which #one# of the keepers was leaning come #sir# he said lend me twenty #franc#
you #will# soon be paid you run no risks with me remember i have relations who possess more #million# than you have deniers
come i beseech you lend me twenty #franc# so that i may buy a dressing gown it is intolerable always to be in a coat and boots
the keeper turned his back and shrugged his #shoulder# he did not even laugh at what would have caused #anyone# else to do so he had heard so many utter the same #thing# indeed he heard #nothing# else
and what a coat #sir# for a prince of the $monsieur_cavalcanti$ come said $andrea_rondolo$ you are a #man# void of compassion i ll have you turned out
this made the keeper #turn# around and he burst into a loud laugh the #prisoner# then approached and formed a circle
i tell you that with that wretched #sum# continued $andrea_rondolo$ i could obtain a coat and a #room# in which to receive the illustrious visitor i am daily expecting
well then lend him the twenty #franc# said the keeper leaning on the #other# #shoulder# surely you #will# not refuse a comrade
of #course# of #course# said the #prisoner# #anyone# can see he a #gentleman# i am no comrade of these #people# said the young #man# proudly
the thieves looked at #one# another with low murmurs and a storm gathered over the #head# of the aristocratic #prisoner# raised less by his own #word# than by the #manner# of the keeper
the latter sure of quelling the tempest when the waves became too violent allowed them to rise to a certain pitch that he might be revenged on the importunate $andrea_rondolo$ and besides it would afford him some recreation during the long #day#
you have no #right# to insult me thus the thieves had already approached $andrea_rondolo$ some screaming la savate la savate
a cruel operation which consists in cuffing a comrade who may have fallen into disgrace not with an old shoe but with an #iron# heeled #one#
#other# proposed the anguille another kind of recreation in which a handkerchief is filled with sand pebbles and two sous #piece# when they have them which the wretches beat like a flail over the #head# and #shoulder# of the unhappy sufferer
but $andrea_rondolo$ turning towards them winked his #eye# rolled his tongue around his cheeks and smacked his #lip# in a #manner# equivalent to a hundred #word# among the #bandit# when forced to be silent
he was immediately recognized as #one# of them the handkerchief was thrown down and the #iron# heeled shoe replaced on the #foot# of the wretch to whom it belonged
some #voice# were heard to say that the #gentleman# was #right# that he intended to be civil in his #way# and that they would set the example of #liberty# of conscience and the mob retired
the keeper was so stupefied at this #scene# that he took $andrea_rondolo$ by the #hand# and began examining his #person# attributing the sudden submission of the inmates of the lions
let us horsewhip the fine #gentleman# said #other# it was a masonic #sign# $m_caderousse$ had taught him den to #something# more substantial than mere fascination
$andrea_rondolo$ made no resistance although he protested against it suddenly a #voice# was heard at the wicket $m_benedetto$ exclaimed an #inspector#
the keeper relaxed his hold i am called said $andrea_rondolo$ to the visitors #room# said the same #voice#
you see someone pays me a #visit# ah my dear #sir# you #will# see whether a $monsieur_cavalcanti$ is to be treated like a common #person#
and $andrea_rondolo$ gliding through the #court# like a black #shadow# rushed out through the wicket leaving his comrades and even the keeper lost in wonder
certainly a call to the visitors #room# had scarcely astonished $andrea_rondolo$ less than themselves for the wily youth instead of making #use# of his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into la force had maintained a rigid #silence#
#everything# he said proves me to be under the protection of some powerful #person# this sudden #fortune# the facility with which i have overcome all obstacles an unexpected #family# and an illustrious #name# awarded to me #gold# showered down upon me and the most splendid alliances about to be entered into
an unhappy lapse of #fortune# and the absence of my protector have cast me down certainly but not forever
the #hand# which has retreated for a while #will# be again stretched forth to save me at the very #moment# when i shall think myself sinking into the abyss
he has two #mean# of extricating me from this dilemma the #one# by a mysterious escape managed through bribery the #other# by buying off my judges with #gold#
i #will# say and do #nothing# until i am convinced that he has quite abandoned me and then $andrea_rondolo$ had formed a #plan# which was tolerably clever
why should i risk an imprudent #step# it might alienate my protector the unfortunate youth was intrepid in the attack and rude in the defence
he had borne with the public #prison# and with privations of all #sort# still by degrees #nature# or rather custom had prevailed and he suffered from being naked dirty and hungry
it was at this #moment# of discomfort that the #inspector# #voice# called him to the visiting #room# $andrea_rondolo$ felt his #heart# leap with #joy#
it was too soon for a #visit# from the examining #magistrate# and too late for #one# from the director of the #prison# or the #doctor# it must then be the visitor he hoped for
behind the grating of the #room# into which $andrea_rondolo$ had been led he saw while his #eye# dilated with surprise the dark and intelligent #face# of $m_bertuccio$ who was also gazing with sad #astonishment# upon the #iron# bars the bolted #door# and the #shadow# which moved behind the #other# grating
ah said $andrea_rondolo$ deeply affected good #morning# $m_benedetto$ said $m_bertuccio$ with his deep hollow #voice# you you said the young #man# looking fearfully around him
#silence# be silent said $andrea_rondolo$ who knew the delicate sense of hearing possessed by the #wall# for heaven sake do not speak so loud
do you not recognize me unhappy #child# you #wish# to speak with me alone do you not said $m_bertuccio$
oh yes that is well and $m_bertuccio$ #feeling# in his #pocket# signed to a keeper whom he saw through the #window# of the wicket
read he said what is that asked $andrea_rondolo$ an #order# to conduct you to a #room# and to leave you there to talk to me
oh cried $andrea_rondolo$ leaping with #joy# then he mentally added still my unknown protector i am not forgotten they #wish# for secrecy since we are to converse in a private #room#
the keeper spoke for a #moment# with an official then opened the #iron# #gate# and conducted $andrea_rondolo$ to a #room# on the first #floor#
the #room# was whitewashed as is the custom in #prison# but it looked quite brilliant to a #prisoner# though a stove a #bed# a #chair# and a #table# formed the whole of its sumptuous furniture
i understand $m_bertuccio$ has been sent by my protector $m_bertuccio$ sat down upon the #chair# $andrea_rondolo$ threw himself upon the #bed# the keeper retired
now said the steward what have you to tell me and you said $andrea_rondolo$ you speak first
oh no you must have much to tell me since you have come to seek me well be it so
if you had me taken to a private #room# only to tell me this you might have saved yourself the trouble
you have continued your #course# of villany you have robbed you have assassinated well i should say i know all these #thing#
but there are some with which on the #contrary# i am not acquainted let us talk of those if you please
who sent you come come you are going on quickly $m_benedetto$ yes and to the #point# let us dispense with useless #word#
who sends you no #one# how did you know i was in #prison# i recognized you some #time# since as the insolent dandy who so gracefully mounted his #horse# in the champs élysées
oh the champs élysées ah yes we burn as they say at the game of pincette the champs élysées come let us talk a little about my #father#
but it was not you i presume who placed at my disposal #franc# which i spent in four or five #month# it was not you who manufactured an italian #gentleman# for my #father# it was not you who introduced me into the #world# and had me invited to a certain #dinner# at $auteuil$ which i fancy i am eating at this #moment# in company with the most distinguished #people# in paris amongst the #rest# with a certain #procureur# whose acquaintance i did very wrong not to cultivate for he would have been very useful to me
just now it was not you in #fact# who bailed me for #one# or two #million# when the fatal discovery of my little #secret# took #place#
who then am i you #sir# you are my adopted #father# come speak my worthy corsican speak what do you #wish# me to say
i #will# help you you were speaking of the champs élysées just now worthy foster #father# well well in the champs élysées there resides a very rich #gentleman#
at whose $house_of_peers$ you robbed and murdered did you not i believe i did the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
tis you who have named him as racine says well am i to rush into his #arm# and strain him to my #heart# crying my #father# my #father# like
do not let us jest gravely replied $m_bertuccio$ and dare not to utter that #name# again as you have pronounced it
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ pixérécourt bah said $andrea_rondolo$ a little overcome by the solemnity of $m_bertuccio$ #manner# why not
because the #person# who bears it is too highly favored by heaven to be the #father# of such a wretch as you
oh these are fine #word# and there #will# be fine doings if you do not take #care#
do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself said $m_bertuccio$ in so calm a #tone# and with so steadfast a #look# that $andrea_rondolo$ was moved to the very soul
menaces i do not #fear# them i #will# say do you think you have to do with galley slaves or novices in the #world#
do not play with the thunderbolt they have laid aside for a #moment# but which they can take up again instantly if you attempt to intercept their movements
$m_benedetto$ you are fallen into terrible #hand# they are ready to open for you make #use# of them my #father#
i #will# know who my #father# is said the obstinate youth i #will# perish if i must but i #will# know it
what does scandal signify to me what #possession# what reputation what pull as $m_beauchamp$ says have i you great #people# always lose #something# by scandal notwithstanding your #million#
come who is my #father# i came to tell you ah cried $m_benedetto$ his #eye# sparkling with #joy#
just then the #door# opened and the #jailer# addressing himself to $m_bertuccio$ said excuse me #sir# but the examining #magistrate# is waiting for the #prisoner#
and so closes our interview said $andrea_rondolo$ to the worthy steward i #wish# the troublesome #fellow# were at the devil
ah #sir# do leave a few crowns for me at the #gate# that i may have some #thing# i am in need of
i #will# #return# #tomorrow# said $m_bertuccio$ good gendarmes i am at your #service# it shall be done replied $m_bertuccio$
$andrea_rondolo$ extended his #hand# $m_bertuccio$ kept his own in his #pocket# and merely jingled a few #piece# of #money# that what i #mean# said $andrea_rondolo$ endeavoring to #smile# quite overcome by the strange tranquillity of $m_bertuccio$
can i be deceived he murmured as he stepped into the oblong and grated vehicle which they call the salad basket
never #mind# we shall see #tomorrow# then he added turning towards $m_bertuccio$ #tomorrow# replied the steward #chapter#
the judge we remember that the $abbé_busoni$ remained alone with $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in the #chamber# of #death# and that the old #man# and the #priest# were the sole guardians of the young #girl# #body#
perhaps it was the christian exhortations of the #abbé# perhaps his kind charity perhaps his persuasive #word# which had restored the courage of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ for ever since he had conversed with the #priest# his violent #despair# had yielded to a calm resignation which surprised all who knew his excessive affection for $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
the whole establishment had been changed another #valet# was engaged for himself a new #servant# for $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ two #woman# had entered #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ s
#fact# everywhere to the concierge and coachmen new #face# were presented to the different #master# of the $house_of_peers$ thus widening the division which had always existed between the members of the same #family#
the assizes also were about to begin and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ shut up in his #room# exerted himself with feverish anxiety in #drawing# up the #case# against the murderer of $m_caderousse$
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had not seen his #father# since the #morning# of the #death# #service# in this #affair# like all those in which the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ had interfered caused a great sensation in paris
the #proof# were certainly not convincing since they rested upon a few #word# written by an escaped galley slave on his #death# #bed# and who might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his #companion#
but the #mind# of the #procureur# was made up he felt assured that $m_benedetto$ was guilty and he hoped by his skill in conducting this aggravated #case# to flatter his self #love# which was about the only vulnerable #point# left in his frozen #heart#
the #case# was therefore prepared owing to the incessant labor of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who wished it to be the first on the list in the coming assizes
he had been obliged to seclude himself more than ever to evade the enormous number of applications presented to him for the #purpose# of obtaining tickets of admission to the #court# on the #day# of trial
and then so short a #time# had elapsed since the #death# of poor $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and the gloom which overshadowed the $house_of_peers$ was so recent that no #one# wondered to see the #father# so absorbed in his professional #duty# which were the only #mean# he had of dissipating his #grief#
once only had $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ seen his #father# it was the #day# after that upon which $m_bertuccio$ had paid his second #visit# to $m_benedetto$ when the latter was to learn his #father# #name#
the #magistrate# harassed and fatigued had descended to the #garden# of his $house_of_peers$ and in a gloomy mood similar to that in which tarquin lopped off the tallest poppies he began knocking off with his cane the long and dying branches of the rose #tree# which placed along the avenue seemed like the spectres of the brilliant flowers which had bloomed in the past season
more than once he had reached that #part# of the #garden# where the famous boarded #gate# stood overlooking the deserted enclosure always returning by the same path to begin his walk again at the same pace and with the same gesture when he accidentally turned his #eye# towards the $house_of_peers$ whence he heard the noisy play of his #son# who had returned from school to spend the sunday and monday with his #mother#
while doing so he observed $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ at #one# of the open #window# where the old #man# had been placed that he might enjoy the last rays of the sun which yet yielded some heat and was now shining upon the dying flowers and red leaves of the creeper which twined around the balcony
his #glance# was so full of hate of ferocity and savage impatience that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ turned out of the path he had been pursuing to see upon what #person# this dark #look# was directed
then he saw beneath a thick clump of linden #tree# which were nearly divested of foliage #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ sitting with a book in her #hand# the perusal of which she frequently interrupted to #smile# upon her #son# or to throw back his elastic ball which he obstinately threw from the #drawing# #room# into the #garden#
the #eye# of the old #man# was riveted upon a #spot# which $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ could scarcely distinguish $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ became pale he understood the old #man#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ continued to #look# at the same object but suddenly his #glance# was transferred from the #wife# to the #husband# and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ himself had to submit to the searching investigation of #eye# which while changing their direction and even their language had lost none of their menacing #expression#
meaning #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ unconscious of the passions that exhausted their #fire# over her #head# at that #moment# held her #son#
$edward$ begged for a long while the maternal kiss probably not offering sufficient recompense for the trouble he must take to obtain it however at #length# he decided leaped out of the #window# into a cluster of heliotropes and daisies and ran to his #mother# his #forehead# streaming with perspiration
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ wiped his #forehead# pressed her #lip# upon it and sent him back with the ball in #one# #hand# and some bonbons in the #other#
ball and was making #sign# to him to reclaim it with a kiss $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ drawn by an irresistible attraction like that of the bird to the serpent walked towards the $house_of_peers$
as he approached it $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ gaze followed him and his #eye# appeared of such a fiery brightness that $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ felt them pierce to the depths of his #heart#
in that earnest #look# might be read a deep reproach as well as a terrible menace then $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ raised his #eye# to heaven as though to remind his #son# of a forgotten oath
it is well #sir# replied $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ from below it is well have patience but #one# #day# longer what i have said i #will# do
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ violently unbuttoned his greatcoat which seemed to strangle him and passing his livid #hand# across his #forehead# entered his #study#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ seemed to be calmed by these #word# and turned his #eye# with indifference to the #other# #side# the #night# was cold and still the #family# had all retired to #rest#
but $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who alone remained up and worked till five clock in the #morning# reviewing the last interrogatories made the #night# before by the examining #magistrate# compiling the depositions of the witnesses and putting the finishing stroke to the deed of accusation which was #one# of the most energetic and best conceived of any he had yet delivered
the #morning# dawned dull and gloomy and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ saw the dim gray #light# shine upon the #line# he had traced in red ink
the #magistrate# had slept for a short #time# while the lamp sent forth its final struggles its flickerings awoke him and he found his #finger# as damp and purple as though they had been dipped in #blood#
he opened the #window# a bright yellow streak crossed the sky and seemed to divide in #half# the poplars which stood out in black relief on the horizon
the next #day# monday was the first sitting of the assizes in the clover fields beyond the chestnut #tree# a lark was mounting up to heaven while pouring out her clear #morning# song
the damps of the dew bathed the #head# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and refreshed his memory #today# he said with an #effort# #today# the #man# who holds the blade of #justice# must strike wherever there is guilt
the curtain was drawn and yet the image of his #father# was so vivid to his #mind# that he addressed the closed #window# as though it had been open and as if through the #opening# he had beheld the menacing old #man#
involuntarily his #eye# wandered towards the #window# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #room# where he had seen him the preceding #night# yes he murmured yes be satisfied
his #head# dropped upon his chest and in this #position# he paced his #study# then he threw himself dressed as he was upon a sofa less to sleep than to #rest# his limbs cramped with cold and #study#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ from his #study# heard the successive #noise# which accompany the #life# of a $house_of_peers$ the #opening# and shutting of #door# the ringing of #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ bell to summon the waiting maid mingled with the first shouts of the #child# who rose full of the enjoyment of his #age#
by degrees #everyone# awoke $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ also rang his new #valet# brought him the #paper# and with them a cup of chocolate
what are you bringing me said he a cup of chocolate i did not ask for it
she said you would have to speak a great deal in the murder #case# and that you should take #something# to keep up your #strength# and the #valet# placed the cup on the #table# nearest to the sofa which was like all the #rest# covered with #paper#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ looked for an #instant# with a gloomy #expression# then suddenly taking it up with a nervous motion he swallowed its contents at #one# draught
it might have been #thought# that he hoped the beverage would be mortal and that he sought for #death# to deliver him from a #duty# which he would rather die than fulfil
who has paid me this #attention# my mistress #sir# the #valet# then left the #room# he then rose and paced his #room# with a #smile# it would have been terrible to witness
the chocolate was inoffensive for $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ felt no #effect# the breakfast #hour# arrived but $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was not at #table#
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #wish# to remind you #sir# he said that eleven clock has just struck and that the trial commences at twelve
the #valet# re entered well said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ what then #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ is dressed she is quite ready and #wish# to know if she is to accompany you #sir#
where to to the palais what to do my mistress #wish# much to be present at the trial
ah said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with a startling accent does she #wish# that the #servant# drew back and said if you #wish# to go alone #sir# i #will# go and tell my mistress
tell your mistress he at #length# answered that i #wish# to speak to her and i beg she #will# wait for me in her own #room#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ remained silent for a #moment# and dented his pale cheeks with his nails yes #sir#
then come to dress and shave me directly #sir# the #valet# re appeared almost instantly and having shaved his #master# assisted him to dress entirely in black
when he had finished he said my mistress said she should expect you #sir# as soon as you had finished dressing
and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with his #paper# under his #arm# and hat in #hand# directed his #step# toward the #apartment# of his #wife#
i am going to her at the #door# he paused for a #moment# to wipe his damp pale #brow#
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was sitting on an ottoman and impatiently turning over the leaves of some newspapers and pamphlets which young $edward$ by #way# of amusing himself was tearing to #piece# before his #mother# could finish reading them
she was dressed to go out her bonnet was placed beside her on a #chair# and her gloves were on her #hand#
he then entered the #room# ah here you are $monsieur_cavalcanti$ she said in her naturally calm #voice# but how pale you are
have you been working all #night# why did you not come down to breakfast well #will# you take me or shall i take $edward$
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had multiplied her #question# in #order# to gain #one# #answer# but to all her inquiries $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ remained mute and cold as a statue
$edward$ said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ fixing an imperious #glance# on the #child# go and play in the #drawing# #room# my dear i #wish# to speak to your mamma
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ shuddered at the #sight# of that cold #countenance# that resolute #tone# and the awfully strange preliminaries
$edward$ raised his #head# looked at his #mother# and then finding that she did not confirm the #order# began cutting off the #head# of his leaden #soldier#
$edward$ cried $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ so harshly that the #child# started up from the #floor# do you hear me go
the #child# unaccustomed to such treatment arose pale and trembling it would be difficult to say whether his #emotion# were caused by #fear# or passion
his #father# went up to him took him in his #arm# and kissed his #forehead# go he said go my #child#
dear me said the young #woman# endeavoring to read her #husband# inmost #thought# while a #smile# passed over her #countenance# which froze the impassibility of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
$edward$ ran out $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ went to the #door# which he closed behind the #child# and bolted what is the #matter#
#madame# where do you keep the #poison# you generally #use# said the #magistrate# without any introduction placing himself between his #wife# and the #door#
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ must have experienced #something# of the sensation of a bird which looking up sees the murderous trap closing over its #head#
a hoarse broken #tone# which was neither a #cry# nor a sigh escaped from her while she became deadly pale
and in her first paroxysm of #terror# she had raised herself from the sofa in the next stronger very likely than the #other# she fell down again on the cushions
i asked you continued $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in a perfectly calm #tone# where you conceal the #poison# by the aid of which you have killed my #father# in #law# de $madame_de_saint_méran$ my #mother# in #law# $madame_de_saint_méran$ $barrois$ and my #daughter# $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
$monsieur_cavalcanti$ she said i i do not understand you ah #sir# exclaimed #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ clasping her #hand#
what do you say it is not for you to interrogate but to #answer# is it to the judge or to the #husband#
it was terrible to behold the frightful pallor of that #woman# the anguish of her #look# the trembling of her whole frame
stammered #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ to the judge to the judge #madame# ah #sir# she muttered ah #sir# and this was all
you do not #answer# #madame# exclaimed the terrible interrogator then he added with a #smile# yet more terrible than his anger
it is true then you do not deny it she moved forward and you cannot deny it added $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ extending his #hand# toward her as though to seize her in the #name# of #justice#
you have accomplished these different #crime# with impudent address but which could only deceive those whose affections for you blinded them
since the #death# of $madame_de_saint_méran$ i have known that a poisoner lived in my $house_of_peers$ $m_d_avrigny$ warned me of it
after the #death# of $barrois$ my suspicions were directed towards an angel those suspicions which even when there is no #crime# are always alive in my #heart# but after the #death# of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ there has been no #doubt# in my #mind# #madame# and not only in mine but in those of #other# thus your #crime# known by two #person# suspected by many #will# soon become public and as i told you just now you no longer speak to the #husband# but to the judge
the young #woman# hid her #face# in her #hand# oh #sir# she stammered i beseech you do not believe #appearance#
are you then a coward cried $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in a contemptuous #voice# but i have always observed that poisoners were cowards
can you be a coward you who have had the courage to witness the #death# of two old #man# and a young #girl# murdered by you
#sir# sir can you be a coward continued $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ with increasing excitement you who could #count# #one# by #one# the #minute# of four #death# agonies
you who have arranged your infernal #plan# and removed the beverages with a talent and precision almost miraculous have you then who have calculated #everything# with such nicety have you forgotten to calculate #one# #thing#
you must have saved some surer more subtle and deadly #poison# than any #other# that you might escape the punishment that you deserve
i #mean# where the revelation of your #crime# #will# lead you to oh it is impossible you have done this
i understand he said you confess but a confession made to the judges a confession made at the last #moment# extorted when the #crime# cannot be denied diminishes not the punishment inflicted on the guilty
i #hope# so at least #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ stretched out her #hand# and fell on her knees the punishment
exclaimed #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the punishment $monsieur_cavalcanti$ twice you have pronounced that #word# certainly did you #hope# to escape it because you were four #time# guilty
the scaffold awaits the poisoner whoever she may be unless as i just said the poisoner has taken the precaution of keeping for herself a few drops of her deadliest #poison#
did you think the punishment would be withheld because you are the #wife# of him who pronounces it no #madame# no #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ uttered a wild #cry# and a hideous and uncontrollable #terror# spread over her distorted #feature#
i #will# not dishonor you since that would be dishonor to myself no if you have heard me distinctly you #will# understand that you are not to die on the scaffold
oh do not #fear# the scaffold #madame# said the #magistrate# no i do not understand what do you #mean#
i #mean# that the #wife# of the first #magistrate# in the capital shall not by her infamy soil an unblemished #name# that she shall not with #one# blow dishonor her #husband# and her #child#
stammered the unhappy #woman# completely overwhelmed no no oh no well #madame# it #will# be a laudable action on your #part# and i #will# #thank# you for it
you #will# #thank# me for what for what you have just said what did i say oh my brain whirls
i no longer understand #anything# oh my god my god and she rose with her #hair# dishevelled and her #lip# foaming
have you answered the #question# i put to you on entering the #room# where do you keep the #poison# you generally #use# #madame#
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ raised her #arm# to heaven and convulsively struck #one# #hand# against the #other# no no she vociferated
no you cannot #wish# that what i do not #wish# #madame# is that you should perish on the scaffold
i am on the #earth# to punish #madame# he added with a flaming #glance# any #other# #woman# were it the queen herself i would send to the executioner but to you i shall be merciful
do you understand asked $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ oh mercy mercy $monsieur_cavalcanti$ what i require is that #justice# be done to you i #will# say have you not #madame# put aside some of the surest deadliest most speedy #poison#
oh pardon me #sir# let me live she is cowardly said $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ reflect that i am your #wife#
you are a poisoner in the #name# of heaven no in the #name# of the #love# you once bore me
no no in the #name# of our #child# ah for the sake of our #child# let me live m
no no no i tell you #one# #day# if i allow you to live you #will# perhaps kill him as you have the #other#
i i kill my #boy# cried the distracted #mother# rushing toward $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ i kill my #son# ha ha ha and a frightful demoniac laugh finished the sentence which was lost in a hoarse rattle
if on my #return# #justice# has not been satisfied i #will# denounce you with my own mouth and arrest you with my own #hand#
#madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ fell at her #husband# #foot# he approached her think of it #madame# he said she listened panting overwhelmed crushed her #eye# alone lived and glared horribly
do you understand me he said i am going down there to pronounce the sentence of #death# against a murderer
if i find you alive on my #return# you shall sleep tonight in the conciergerie #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ sighed her nerves gave #way# and she sunk on the carpet
the #king# attorney seemed to experience a sensation of #pity# he looked upon her less severely and bowing to her said slowly farewell #madame# farewell
that farewell struck #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ like the executioner knife she fainted the #procureur# went out after having double locked the #door#
the assizes the $m_benedetto$ #affair# as it was called at the palais and by #people# in general had produced a tremendous sensation
frequenting the café de paris the boulevard de gand and the bois de boulogne during his brief career of splendor the false $monsieur_cavalcanti$ had formed a host of acquaintances
the #paper# had related his various adventures both as the #man# of fashion and the galley slave and as #everyone# who had been personally acquainted with prince $andrea_rondolo$ $monsieur_cavalcanti$ experienced a lively curiosity in his fate they all determined to spare no trouble in endeavoring to witness the trial of $m_benedetto$ for the murder of his comrade in chains
in the #eye# of many $m_benedetto$ appeared if not a victim to at least an instance of the fallibility of the #law#
m $monsieur_cavalcanti$ his #father# had been seen in paris and it was expected that he would re appear to claim the illustrious outcast
many also who were not aware of the #circumstance# attending his withdrawal from paris were struck with the worthy #appearance# the gentlemanly bearing and the knowledge of the #world# displayed by the old patrician who certainly played the nobleman very well so long as he said #nothing# and made no arithmetical calculations
as for the accused himself many remembered him as being so amiable so handsome and so liberal that they chose to think him the victim of some conspiracy since in this #world# large #fortune# frequently excite the malevolence and jealousy of some unknown #enemy#
from seven clock in the #morning# a crowd was stationed at the #iron# #gate# and an #hour# before the trial commenced the hall was full of the privileged
before the entrance of the #magistrate# and indeed frequently afterwards a #court# of #justice# on #day# when some especial trial is to take #place# resembles a #drawing# #room# where many #person# recognize each #other# and converse if they can do so without losing their #seat# or if they are separated by too great a number of lawyers communicate by #sign#
it was #one# of the magnificent autumn #day# which make amends for a short summer the clouds which $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had perceived at sunrise had all disappeared as if by magic and #one# of the softest and most brilliant #day# of september shone forth in all its splendor
$m_beauchamp$ #one# of the #king# of the press and therefore claiming the #right# of a throne everywhere was eying everybody through his monocle
he perceived $baron_de_château_renaud$ and $m_lucien_debray$ who had just gained the good graces of a sergeant at #arm# and who had persuaded the latter to let them stand before instead of behind him as they ought to have done
the worthy sergeant had recognized the #minister# secretary and the millionnaire and by #way# of paying extra #attention# to his noble neighbors promised to keep their #place# while they paid a #visit# to $m_beauchamp$
#chapter# #everyone# therefore ran to the #court# some to witness the #sight# #other# to comment upon it well said $m_beauchamp$ we shall see our #friend#
yes indeed replied $m_lucien_debray$ that worthy prince deuce take those italian princes a #man# too who could boast of dante for a genealogist and could reckon back to the divina comedia
a nobility of the rope said $baron_de_château_renaud$ phlegmatically he #will# be condemned #will# he not asked $m_lucien_debray$ of $m_beauchamp$
my dear #fellow# i think we should ask you that #question# you know such news much better than we do
did you see the #president# at the #minister# last #night# yes what did he say #something# which #will# surprise you
oh make haste and tell me then it is a long #time# since that has happened
well he told me that $m_benedetto$ who is considered a serpent of subtlety and a giant of cunning is really but a very commonplace silly rascal and altogether unworthy of the experiments that #will# be made on his phrenological organs after his #death#
yes for you who detest those unhappy princes $m_beauchamp$ and are always delighted to find fault with them but not for me who discover a #gentleman# by instinct and who scent out an aristocratic #family# like a very bloodhound of heraldry
bah said $m_beauchamp$ he played the prince very well then you never believed in the principality
yes in the principality but not in the prince not so bad said $m_beauchamp$ still i assure you he passed very well with many #people# i saw him at the #minister# #house#
ah yes said $baron_de_château_renaud$ the #idea# of thinking #minister# understand #anything# about princes there is #something# in what you have just said said $m_beauchamp$ laughing
but said $m_lucien_debray$ to $m_beauchamp$ if i spoke to the #president# you must have been with the #procureur#
it is natural enough this strange chain of domestic afflictions followed by the no less strange #death# of his #daughter# strange
oh yes do you pretend that all this has been unobserved at the #minister# said $m_beauchamp$ placing his #eye# #glass# in his #eye# where he tried to make it remain
it was an impossibility for the last week $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ has secluded himself what do you #mean# $m_beauchamp$
my dear #sir# said $baron_de_château_renaud$ allow me to tell you that you do not understand that manœuvre with the #eye# #glass# #half# so well as $m_lucien_debray$
give him a lesson $m_lucien_debray$ stay said $m_beauchamp$ surely i am not deceived what is it
it is she whom do you #mean# they said she had left $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ said $baron_de_château_renaud$ has she returned
said $baron_de_château_renaud$ only ten #day# after the flight of her #daughter# and three #day# from the bankruptcy of her #husband#
no but her #mother# #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ nonsense impossible $m_lucien_debray$ colored slightly and followed with his #eye# the direction of $m_beauchamp$ #glance#
come he said it is only a veiled #lady# some foreign princess perhaps the #mother# of $monsieur_cavalcanti$ but you were just speaking on a very interesting topic $m_beauchamp$
i yes you were telling us about the extraordinary #death# of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ ah yes so i was
but how is it that #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ is not here poor dear #woman# said $m_lucien_debray$ she is no #doubt# occupied in distilling balm for the hospitals or in making cosmetics for herself or #friend#
do you know she spends two or three thousand crowns a #year# in this amusement but i wonder she is not here
i should have been pleased to see her for i like her very much and i hate her said $baron_de_château_renaud$
why i do not know why do we #love# why do we hate i detest her from antipathy
or rather by instinct perhaps so but to #return# to what you were saying $m_beauchamp$ well do you know why they die so multitudinously at $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
multitudinously is good said $baron_de_château_renaud$ my good #fellow# you ll find the #word# in saint simon but the #thing# itself is at $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ but let get back to the #subject#
talking of that said $m_lucien_debray$ #madame# was making inquiries about that $house_of_peers$ which for the last three #month# has been hung with black
who is #madame# asked $baron_de_château_renaud$ the #minister# #wife# $pardieu$ oh your pardon i never #visit# #minister# i leave that to the princes
really you were only before sparkling but now you are brilliant take compassion on us or like jupiter you #will# wither us up
i #will# not speak again said $baron_de_château_renaud$ pray have compassion upon me and do not take up every #word# i say
come let us endeavor to get to the #end# of our #story# $m_beauchamp$ i told you that #yesterday# #madame# made inquiries of me upon the #subject# enlighten me and i #will# then communicate my information to her
well #gentleman# the #reason# #people# die so multitudinously i like the #word# at $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ is that there is an assassin in the $house_of_peers$
the two young #man# shuddered for the same #idea# had more than once occurred to them
a burst of laughter from the auditors did not in the least disconcert the speaker who continued yes #gentleman# $edward$ the infant phenomenon who is quite an adept in the art of killing
and who is the assassin they asked together young $edward$ you are jesting not at all
i intend sending him away #tomorrow# for he eats so enormously to make up for the fast imposed upon him by his #terror# in that $house_of_peers$
i #yesterday# engaged a #servant# who had just left $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ well now listen we are listening
it appears the dear #child# has obtained #possession# of a bottle containing some drug which he every now and then uses against those who have displeased him
first and $madame_de_saint_méran$ incurred his displeasure so he poured out three drops of his elixir three drops were sufficient then followed $barrois$ the old #servant# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who sometimes rebuffed this little wretch
he therefore received the same quantity of the elixir the same happened to $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ of whom he was jealous he gave her the same dose as the #other# and all was over for her as well as the #rest#
why what nonsense are you telling us said $baron_de_château_renaud$ yes it is an extraordinary #story# said $m_beauchamp$ is it not
it is absurd said $m_lucien_debray$ ah said $m_beauchamp$ you #doubt# me well you can ask my #servant# or rather him who #will# no longer be my #servant# #tomorrow#
it was the talk of the $house_of_peers$ and this elixir where is it what is it the #child# conceals it
but where did he find it in his #mother# laboratory does his #mother# then keep #poison# in her laboratory
how can i tell you are questioning me like a #king# attorney i only repeat what i have been told and like my informant i can do no more
the poor devil would eat #nothing# from #fear# it is incredible no my dear #fellow# it is not at all incredible
you saw the #child# pass through the rue richelieu last #year# who amused himself with killing his #brother# and sisters by sticking pins in their ears while they slept
come $m_beauchamp$ said $baron_de_château_renaud$ i #will# bet #anything# you do not believe a #word# of all you have been telling us
the generation who follow us are very precocious but i do not see the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ here
he is worn out said $m_lucien_debray$ besides he could not well appear in public since he has been the dupe of the $monsieur_cavalcanti$ who it appears presented themselves to him with false #letter# of credit and cheated him out of #franc# upon the hypothesis of this principality
by the #way# de $baron_de_château_renaud$ asked $m_beauchamp$ how is $m_maximilian_morrel$ ma foi i have called three #time# without once seeing him
still his sister did not seem uneasy and told me that though she had not seen him for two or three #day# she was sure he was well
ah now i think of it the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ cannot appear in the hall said $m_beauchamp$
why not because he is an actor in the drama has he assassinated #anyone# then no on the #contrary# they wished to assassinate him
you know that the famous waistcoat was found in his $house_of_peers$ containing the #letter# which stopped the signature of the #marriage# contract
you know that it was in leaving his $house_of_peers$ that de $m_caderousse$ was murdered by his #friend# $m_benedetto$ do you see the waistcoat
there it is all #blood# stained on the desk as a testimony of the #crime# ah very good hush #gentleman# here is the #court# let us go back to our #place#
a #noise# was heard in the hall the sergeant called his two patrons with an energetic hem and the #door# keeper appearing called out with that shrill #voice# peculiar to his #order# ever since the #day# of beaumarchais
the judges took their #place# in the midst of the most profound #silence# the jury took their #seat# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the object of unusual #attention# and we had almost said of general admiration sat in the armchair and cast a tranquil #glance# around him
#everyone# looked with #astonishment# on that grave and severe #face# whose calm #expression# personal #grief# had been unable to disturb and the aspect of a #man# who was a #stranger# to all human #emotion# excited #something# very like #terror#
at these #word# the public #attention# became more intense and all #eye# were turned towards the #door# through which $m_benedetto$ was to enter
the #court# #gentleman# #chapter# the indictment gendarmes said the #president# lead in the accused the #door# soon opened and the accused appeared
the same impression was experienced by all present and no #one# was deceived by the #expression# of his #countenance# his #feature# bore no #sign# of that deep #emotion# which stops the beating of the #heart# and blanches the cheek
his #hand# gracefully placed #one# upon his hat the #other# in the #opening# of his white waistcoat were not at all tremulous his #eye# was calm and even brilliant
scarcely had he entered the hall when he glanced at the whole #body# of #magistrate# and assistants his #eye# rested longer on the #president# and still more so on the #king# attorney
by the #side# of $andrea_rondolo$ was stationed the lawyer who was to conduct his defence and who had been appointed by the #court# for $andrea_rondolo$ disdained to pay any #attention# to those details to which he appeared to attach no importance
the lawyer was a young #man# with #light# #hair# whose #face# expressed a hundred #time# more #emotion# than that which characterized the #prisoner#
during the reading of this which was long the public #attention# was continually drawn towards $andrea_rondolo$ who bore the inspection with spartan unconcern
the #president# called for the indictment revised as we know by the clever and implacable pen of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ villefort had never been so concise and eloquent
the #crime# was depicted in the most vivid colors the former #life# of the #prisoner# his transformation a review of his #life# from the earliest period were set forth with all the talent that a knowledge of human #life# could furnish to a #mind# like that of the #procureur#
$m_benedetto$ was thus forever condemned in public #opinion# before the sentence of the #law# could be pronounced $andrea_rondolo$ paid no #attention# to the successive charges which were brought against him
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who examined him attentively and who no #doubt# practiced upon him all the psychological #study# he was accustomed to #use# in vain endeavored to make him lower his #eye# notwithstanding the depth and profundity of his gaze
at #length# the reading of the indictment was ended accused said the #president# your #name# and surname $andrea_rondolo$ arose
excuse me mr #president# he said in a clear #voice# but i see you are going to adopt a #course# of #question# through which i cannot follow you
i have an #idea# which i #will# explain by and by of making an exception to the usual form of accusation
allow me then if you please to #answer# in different #order# or i #will# not do so at all the astonished #president# looked at the jury who in #turn# looked at $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
the whole assembly manifested great surprise but $andrea_rondolo$ appeared quite unmoved your #age# said the #president# #will# you #answer# that #question#
i #will# #answer# that #question# as well as the #rest# mr #president# but in its #turn# your #age# repeated the #president#
i am twenty #one# #year# old or rather i shall be in a few #day# as i was born the #night# of the th of september
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who was busy taking down some #note# raised his #head# at the mention of this date
a second #time# raised his #head# looked at $m_benedetto$ as if he had been gazing at the #head# of medusa and became livid
where were you born continued the #president# at $auteuil$ near paris $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ as for $m_benedetto$ he gracefully wiped his #lip# with a fine cambric #pocket# handkerchief
your profession first i was a forger answered $andrea_rondolo$ as calmly as possible then i became a thief and lately have become an assassin
the judges themselves appeared to be stupefied and the jury manifested tokens of disgust for a cynicism so unexpected in a #man# of fashion
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ pressed his #hand# upon his #brow# which at first pale had become red and burning then he suddenly arose and looked around as though he had lost his senses
a murmur or rather storm of indignation burst from all #part# of the assembly he wanted #air#
are you looking for #anything# mr #procureur# asked $m_benedetto$ with his most ingratiating #smile# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ answered #nothing# but sat or rather threw himself down again upon his #chair#
the brutal affectation with which you have enumerated and classified your #crime# calls for a severe reprimand on the #part# of the #court# both in the #name# of morality and for the respect due to humanity
you appear to consider this a #point# of #honor# and it may be for this #reason# that you have delayed acknowledging your #name#
and now #prisoner# #will# you consent to tell your #name# said the #president# you wished it to be preceded by all these titles
it is quite wonderful mr #president# how entirely you have read my #thought# said $m_benedetto$ in his softest #voice# and most polite #manner#
this is indeed the #reason# why i begged you to alter the #order# of the #question# the public #astonishment# had reached its height
there was no longer any deceit or bravado in the #manner# of the accused the audience felt that a startling revelation was to follow this ominous prelude
i cannot tell you my #name# since i do not know it but i know my #father# and can tell it to you
a painful giddiness overwhelmed $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ great drops of acrid sweat fell from his #face# upon the #paper# which he held in his convulsed #hand#
well said the #president# your #name# repeat your #father# #name# said the #president# not a whisper not a breath was heard in that vast assembly #everyone# waited anxiously
my #father# is #king# attorney replied $andrea_rondolo$ calmly #king# attorney said the #president# stupefied and without noticing the agitation which spread over the #face# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
the explosion which had been so long restrained from a #feeling# of respect to the #court# of #justice# now burst forth like thunder from the breasts of all present the #court# itself did not seek to restrain the #feeling# of the audience
the exclamations the insults addressed to $m_benedetto$ who remained perfectly unconcerned the energetic gestures the movement of the gendarmes the sneers of the scum of the crowd always sure to rise to the surface in #case# of any disturbance all this lasted five #minute# before the #door# keepers and #magistrate# were able to restore #silence#
#king# attorney yes and if you #wish# to know his #name# i #will# tell it he is named $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in the midst of this tumult the #voice# of thepresident was heard to exclaim
are you playing with #justice# accused and do you dare set your #fellow# citizens an example of disorder which even in these #time# has never been equalled
several #person# hurried up to $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ who sat #half# bowed over in his #chair# offering him consolation encouragement and protestations of zeal and sympathy
#order# was re established in the hall except that a few #people# still moved about and whispered to #one# another a #lady# it was said had just fainted they had supplied her with a smelling bottle and she had recovered
during the #scene# of tumult $andrea_rondolo$ had turned his smiling #face# towards the assembly then leaning with #one# #hand# on the oaken rail of the dock in the most graceful attitude possible he said
#gentleman# i assure you i had no #idea# of insulting the #court# or of making a useless disturbance in the #presence# of this honorable assembly
they ask my #age# i tell it they ask where i was born i #answer# they ask my #name# i cannot give it since my parents abandoned me
but though i cannot give my own #name# not possessing #one# i can tell them my #father# now i repeat my #father# is named $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and i am ready to prove it
there was an energy a conviction and a sincerity in the #manner# of the young #man# which silenced the tumult
all #eye# were turned for a #moment# towards the #procureur# who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt had changed him into a corpse
#gentleman# said $andrea_rondolo$ commanding #silence# by his #voice# and #manner# i owe you the #proof# and explanations of what i have said
but said the irritated #president# you called yourself $m_benedetto$ declared yourself an orphan and claimed corsica as your #country#
i said #anything# i pleased in #order# that the solemn declaration i have just made should not be withheld which otherwise would certainly have been the #case#
i now repeat that i was born at $auteuil$ on the #night# of the th of september and that i am the #son# of the #procureur# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
i was born in no rue de la fontaine in a #room# hung with red damask my #father# took me in his #arm# telling my #mother# i was dead wrapped me in a napkin marked with an and an and carried me into a #garden# where he buried me alive
a shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of the #prisoner# increased in proportion to the #terror# of $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
do you #wish# for any further details i #will# give them but how have you become acquainted with all these details asked the #president#
a #man# who had sworn vengeance against my #father# and had long watched his opportunity to kill him had introduced himself that #night# into the #garden# in which my #father# buried me
he was concealed in a thicket he saw my #father# bury #something# in the #ground# and stabbed him then thinking the deposit might contain some #treasure# he turned up the #ground# and found me still living
i #will# tell you mr #president# the #man# carried me to the foundling asylum where i was registered under the number
three #month# afterwards a #woman# travelled from rogliano to paris to fetch me and having claimed me as her #son# carried me away
thus you see though born in paris i was brought up in corsica there was a #moment# #silence# during which #one# could have fancied the hall empty so profound was the stillness
certainly i might have lived happily amongst those good #people# who adored me but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues which my adopted #mother# endeavored to instil into my #heart#
#one# #day# when i cursed providence for making me so wicked and ordaining me to such a fate my adopted #father# said to me do not blaspheme unhappy #child# the #crime# is that of your #father# not yours of your #father# who consigned you to hell if you died and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive
proceed said the #president# i increased in wickedness till i committed #crime# after that i ceased to blaspheme but i cursed my #father#
that is why i have uttered the #word# for which you blame me that is why i have filled this whole assembly with horror
if i have committed an additional #crime# punish me but if you #will# allow that ever since the #day# of my birth my fate has been sad bitter and lamentable then #pity# me
but your #mother# asked the #president# my #mother# #thought# me dead she is not guilty i did not even #wish# to know her #name# nor do i know it
just then a piercing #cry# ending in a sob burst from the centre of the crowd who encircled the #lady# who had before fainted and who now fell into a violent fit of hysterics
she was carried out of the hall the thick veil which concealed her #face# dropped off and #madame# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was recognized
notwithstanding his shattered nerves the ringing sensation in his ears and the madness which turned his brain $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ rose as he perceived her
the #proof# the #proof# said the #president# remember this tissue of horrors must be supported by the clearest #proof#
the #proof# said $m_benedetto$ laughing do you want #proof# yes well then #look# at $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ and then ask me for #proof#
#everyone# turned towards the #procureur# who unable to bear the universal gaze now riveted on him alone advanced staggering into the midst of the tribunal with his #hair# dishevelled and his #face# indented with the mark of his nails
the whole assembly uttered a long murmur of #astonishment# #father# said $m_benedetto$ i am asked for #proof# do you #wish# me to give them
no no it is useless stammered $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ in a hoarse #voice# no it is useless how useless
cried the #president# what do you #mean# i #mean# that i feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly weight which crushes me
#gentleman# i know i am in the #hand# of an avenging god we need no #proof# #everything# relating to this young #man# is true
a dull gloomy #silence# like that which precedes some awful phenomenon of #nature# pervaded the assembly who shuddered in dismay
what $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ cried the #president# do you yield to an hallucination what are you no longer in #possession# of your senses
the #procureur# dropped his #head# his teeth chattered like those of a #man# under a violent attack of fever and yet he was deadly pale
this strange unexpected terrible accusation has disordered your #reason# come recover i am in #possession# of all my senses #sir# he said
i acknowledge myself guilty of all the young #man# has brought against me and from this #hour# hold myself under the authority of the #procureur# who #will# succeed me
and as he spoke these #word# with a hoarse choking #voice# he staggered towards the #door# which was mechanically opened by a #door# keeper
the whole assembly were dumb with #astonishment# at the revelation and confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which had been expected during the last fortnight by the parisian #world#
my #body# alone suffers as you may suppose well said $m_beauchamp$ let them now say that drama is unnatural
ma foi said $baron_de_château_renaud$ i would rather #end# my career like de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ a #pistol# shot seems quite delightful compared with this catastrophe
and moreover it kills said $m_beauchamp$ and to think that i had an #idea# of marrying his #daughter# said $m_lucien_debray$
the sitting is adjourned #gentleman# said the #president# fresh inquiries #will# be made and the #case# #will# be tried next session by another #magistrate#
as for $andrea_rondolo$ who was calm and more interesting than ever he left the hall escorted by gendarmes who involuntarily paid him some #attention#
she did well to die poor #girl# well what do you think of this my fine #fellow#
asked $m_lucien_debray$ of the sergeant at #arm# slipping a $louis_xviii$ into his #hand# there #will# be extenuating #circumstance# he replied #chapter#
there is #something# so awe inspiring in great afflictions that even in the worst #time# the first #emotion# of a crowd has generally been to sympathize with the sufferer in a great catastrophe
expiation notwithstanding the density of the crowd $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ saw it open before him many #people# have been assassinated in a tumult but even criminals have rarely been insulted during trial
thus $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ passed through the mass of spectators and #officer# of the palais and withdrew though he had acknowledged his guilt he was protected by his #grief#
there are some situations which #man# understand by instinct but which #reason# is powerless to explain in such #case# the greatest poet is he who gives utterance to the most natural and vehement outburst of sorrow
those who hear the bitter #cry# are as much impressed as if they listened to an entire poem and when the sufferer is sincere they are #right# in regarding his outburst as sublime
every pulse beat with feverish excitement every nerve was strained every vein swollen and every #part# of his #body# seemed to suffer distinctly from the #rest# thus multiplying his agony a thousand fold
he made his #way# along the corridors through force of habit he threw aside his magisterial robe not out of deference to etiquette but because it was an unbearable burden a veritable garb of nessus insatiate in torture
having staggered as far as the rue dauphine he perceived his #carriage# awoke his sleeping coachman by #opening# the #door# himself threw himself on the cushions and pointed towards the $faubourg_saint_honoré$ the #carriage# drove on
all the weight of his fallen #fortune# seemed suddenly to crush him he could not foresee the consequences he could not contemplate the future with the indifference of the hardened criminal who merely #face# a contingency already familiar
it would be difficult to describe the state of stupor in which $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ left the palais god was still in his #heart#
god he murmured not knowing what he said god god behind the #event# that had overwhelmed him he saw the #hand# of god
he put out his #hand# to remove the object it was a fan which #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ had left in the #carriage# this fan awakened a recollection which darted through his #mind# like lightning
the #carriage# rolled rapidly onward $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ while turning restlessly on the cushions felt #something# press against him he #thought# of his #wife#
during the last #hour# his own #crime# had alone been presented to his #mind# now another object not less terrible suddenly presented itself
he had just acted the inexorable judge with her he had condemned her to #death# and she crushed by remorse struck with #terror# covered with the shame inspired by the eloquence of his irreproachable virtue she a poor weak #woman# without help or the #power# of defending herself against his absolute and supreme #will# she might at that very #moment# perhaps be preparing to die
an #hour# had elapsed since her condemnation at that #moment# doubtless she was recalling all her #crime# to her memory she was asking pardon for her sins perhaps she was even writing a #letter# imploring forgiveness from her virtuous #husband#
oh he exclaimed as though a red hot #iron# were piercing his #heart# his #wife# a forgiveness she was purchasing with her #death#
i carried the infection of #crime# with me and she has caught it as she would the typhus fever the cholera the plague
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ again groaned with anguish and #despair# ah he exclaimed that #woman# became criminal only from associating with me and yet i have punished her
i have dared to tell her i have repent and die but no she must not die she shall live and with me
we #will# flee from paris and go as far as the #earth# reaches i told her of the scaffold oh heavens i forgot that it awaits me also
yes we #will# fly i #will# confess all to her i #will# tell her daily that i also have committed a #crime# oh what an alliance the tiger and the serpent worthy #wife# of such as i am
how could i pronounce that #word# she must live that my infamy may diminish hers and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ dashed open the #window# in front of the #carriage#
faster faster he cried in a #tone# which electrified the coachman the #horse# impelled by #fear# flew towards the $house_of_peers$
yes yes repeated $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ as he approached his home yes that #woman# must live she must repent and educate my #son# the sole survivor with the exception of the indestructible old #man# of the wreck of my $house_of_peers$
she loves him it was for his sake she has committed these #crime# we ought never to #despair# of softening the #heart# of a #mother# who loves her #child#
the #event# which have taken #place# in my $house_of_peers$ though they now occupy the public #mind# #will# be forgotten in #time# or if indeed a few #enemy# should persist in remembering them why then i #will# add them to my list of #crime#
she #will# repent and no #one# #will# know that she has been guilty what #will# it signify if #one# two or three more are added
my #wife# and #child# shall escape from this gulf carrying #treasure# with them she #will# live and may yet be happy since her #child# in whom all her #love# is centred #will# be with her
i shall have performed a good action and my #heart# #will# be lighter and the #procureur# breathed more freely than he had done for some #time#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ leaped out of the #carriage# and saw that his #servant# were surprised at his early #return# he could read no #other# #expression# on their #feature#
the #carriage# stopped at the #door# of the $house_of_peers$ neither of them spoke to him they merely stood aside to let him pass by as usual #nothing# more
as he passed by $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #room# he perceived two figures through the #half# open #door# but he experienced no curiosity to know who was visiting his #father# anxiety carried him on further
come he said as he ascended the stairs leading to his #wife# #room# #nothing# is changed here he then closed the #door# of the landing
i must speak freely to her accuse myself and say he approached the #door# touched the crystal handle which yielded to his #hand#
no #one# must disturb us he said not locked he cried that is well and he entered the little #room# in which $edward$ slept for
though the #child# went to school during the #day# his #mother# could not allow him to be separated from her at #night#
with a single #glance# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #eye# ran through the #room# not here he said doubtless she is in her bedroom
he rushed towards the #door# found it bolted and stopped shuddering héloïse he cried he fancied he heard the #sound# of a #piece# of furniture being removed
héloïse he repeated who is there answered the #voice# of her he sought he #thought# that #voice# more feeble than usual
open the #door# cried $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ open it is i but notwithstanding this request notwithstanding the #tone# of anguish in which it was uttered the #door# remained closed
at the entrance of the #room# which led to her boudoir #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was standing erect pale her #feature# contracted and her #eye# glaring horribly
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ burst it open with a violent blow héloïse héloïse he said what is the #matter# speak the young #woman# extended her stiff white #hand# towards him
it is done $monsieur_cavalcanti$ she said with a rattling #noise# which seemed to #tear# her throat what more do you want and she fell full #length# on the #floor#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ ran to her and seized her #hand# which convulsively clasped a crystal bottle with a golden stopper #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was dead
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ maddened with horror stepped back to the threshhold of the #door# fixing his #eye# on the corpse my #son#
he exclaimed suddenly where is my #son# $edward$ edward and he rushed out of the #room# still crying $edward$ edward the #name# was pronounced in such a #tone# of anguish that the #servant# ran up
where is my #son# asked $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ let him be removed from the $house_of_peers$ that he may not see #master# $edward$ is not downstairs #sir# replied the #valet#
no #sir# #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ sent for him #half# an #hour# ago he went into her #room# and has not been downstairs since
a cold perspiration burst out on $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #brow# his legs trembled and his #thought# flew about madly in his brain like the wheels of a disordered watch
in #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #room# he murmured and slowly returned with #one# #hand# wiping his #forehead# and with the #other# supporting himself against the #wall#
then he must be playing in the #garden# go and see to enter the #room# he must again see the #body# of his unfortunate #wife#
to call $edward$ he must reawaken the echo of that #room# which now appeared like a sepulchre to speak seemed like violating the #silence# of the tomb
his tongue was paralyzed in his mouth $edward$ he stammered $edward$ the #child# did not #answer# where then could he be if he had entered his #mother# #room# and not since returned
the corpse of #madame# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was stretched across the doorway leading to the #room# in which $edward$ must be those glaring #eye# seemed to watch over the threshold and the #lip# bore the stamp of a terrible and mysterious irony
he stepped forward through the open #door# was visible a portion of the boudoir containing an upright piano and a blue satin couch
the unhappy #man# uttered an exclamation of #joy# a ray of #light# seemed to penetrate the abyss of #despair# and #darkness#
he had only to #step# over the corpse enter the boudoir take the #child# in his #arm# and flee far far away
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ stepped forward two or three paces and beheld his #child# lying no #doubt# asleep on the sofa $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was no longer the civilized #man# he was a tiger hurt unto #death# gnashing his teeth in his wound
he no longer feared realities but phantoms he leaped over the corpse as if it had been a burning brazier he took the #child# in his #arm# embraced him shook him called him but the #child# made no response
he pressed his burning #lip# to the cheeks but they were icy cold and pale he felt the stiffened limbs he pressed his #hand# upon the #heart# but it no longer beat the #child# was dead
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ thunderstruck fell upon his knees the #child# dropped from his #arm# and rolled on the #floor# by the #side# of its #mother#
a folded #paper# fell from $edward$ breast he picked up the #paper# and recognizing his #wife# writing ran his #eye# rapidly over its contents it ran as follows
you know that i was a good #mother# since it was for my #son# sake i became criminal a good #mother# cannot depart without her #son#
$m_noirtier_de_villefort$ could not believe his #eye# he could not believe his #reason# he dragged himself towards the #child# #body# and examined it as a lioness contemplates its dead cub
then a piercing #cry# escaped from his breast and he cried still the #hand# of god the #presence# of the two victims alarmed him he could not bear solitude shared only by two corpses
until then he had been sustained by rage by his #strength# of #mind# by #despair# by the supreme agony which led the titans to scale the heavens and ajax to defy the gods
he now arose his #head# bowed beneath the weight of #grief# and shaking his damp dishevelled #hair# he who had never felt compassion for #anyone# determined to seek his #father# that he might have someone to whom he could relate his #misfortune# someone by whose #side# he might weep
the old #man# appeared to be listening attentively and as affectionately as his infirmities would allow to the $abbé_busoni$ who looked cold and calm as usual
he descended the little #staircase# with which we are acquainted and entered $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #room# $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ perceiving the #abbé# passed his #hand# across his #brow#
he recollected the call he had made upon him after the #dinner# at $auteuil$ and then the #visit# the #abbé# had himself paid to his $house_of_peers$ on the #day# of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #death#
the past came to him like #one# of those waves whose wrath foams fiercer than the #other# you here #sir#
he exclaimed do you then never appear but to act as an escort to #death# $abbé_busoni$ turned around and perceiving the excitement depicted on
the #magistrate# #face# the savage lustre of his #eye# he understood that the revelation had been made at the assizes but beyond this he was ignorant
i came to pray over the #body# of your #daughter# and now why are you here
i come to tell you that you have sufficiently repaid your debt and that from this #moment# i #will# pray to god to forgive you as i do
the #abbé# threw off his wig shook his #head# and his #hair# no longer confined fell in black masses around his manly #face#
good heavens exclaimed $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ stepping back fearfully surely that is not the #voice# of the $abbé_busoni$ no
it is the #face# of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ exclaimed the #procureur# with a haggard #expression# you are not exactly #right# #procureur# you must go farther back
you heard it for the first #time# at marseilles twenty three #year# ago the #day# of your #marriage# with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ de $madame_de_saint_méran$
that #voice# that #voice# where did i first hear it refer to your #paper# you are not $abbé_busoni$ you are not $m_de_monte_cristo$
oh heavens you are then some #secret# implacable and mortal #enemy# i must have wronged you in some #way# at marseilles
oh woe to me yes you are now on the #right# path said the #count# crossing his #arm# over his broad chest search search
exclaimed $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ whose #mind# was balancing between #reason# and insanity in that cloud which is neither a #dream# nor reality
you condemned me to a horrible tedious #death# you killed my #father# you deprived me of #liberty# of #love# and #happiness#
but what have i done to you what have i done to you tell me then speak
who are you then who are you i am the spectre of a wretch you buried in the dungeons of the château if
god gave that spectre the form of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ when he at #length# issued from his tomb enriched him with #gold# and #diamond# and led him to you
ah i recognize you i recognize you exclaimed the #king# attorney you are i am $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$
and up the stairs he dragged $m_de_monte_cristo$ who ignorant of what had happened followed him in #astonishment# foreseeing some new catastrophe
you are $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ cried $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ seizing the #count# by the wrist then come here there $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$
$m_de_monte_cristo$ became pale at this horrible #sight# he felt that he had passed beyond the bounds of vengeance and that he could no longer say god is for and with me
with an #expression# of indescribable anguish he threw himself upon the #body# of the #child# reopened its #eye# felt its pulse and then rushed with him into $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #room# of which he double locked the #door#
he said pointing to the #body# of his #wife# and #child# see are you well avenged my #child# cried $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
he tried to follow $m_de_monte_cristo$ but as though in a #dream# he was transfixed to the #spot# his #eye# glared as though they were starting through the sockets he griped the flesh on his chest until his nails were stained with #blood# the veins of his temples swelled and boiled as though they would burst their narrow boundary and deluge his brain with living #fire#
this lasted several #minute# until the frightful overturn of #reason# was accomplished then uttering a loud #cry# followed by a burst of laughter he rushed down the stairs
he carries away the #body# of my #child# oh curses woe #death# to you a #quarter# of an #hour# afterwards the #door# of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #room# opened and $m_de_monte_cristo$ reappeared
pale with a dull #eye# and heavy #heart# all the noble #feature# of that #face# usually so calm and serene were overcast by #grief#
in his #arm# he held the #child# whom no skill had been able to recall to #life# bending on #one# knee he placed it reverently by the #side# of its #mother# with its #head# upon her breast
then rising he went out and meeting a #servant# on the stairs he asked where is $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ the #servant# instead of answering pointed to the #garden#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ ran down the #step# and advancing towards the #spot# designated beheld $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ encircled by his #servant# with a spade in his #hand# and digging the #earth# with fury
it is not here he cried it is not here and then he moved farther on and began again to dig
$m_de_monte_cristo$ approached him and said in a low #voice# with an #expression# almost humble #sir# you have indeed lost a #son# but $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ interrupted him he had neither listened nor heard
oh i #will# find it he cried you may pretend he is not here but i #will# find him though i dig forever
and as though he feared that the #wall# of the accursed $house_of_peers$ would crumble around him he rushed into the #street# for the first #time# doubting whether he had the #right# to do as he had done
$m_de_monte_cristo$ drew back in horror oh he said he is mad oh enough of this enough of this he cried let me save the last
on entering his $house_of_peers$ he met $m_maximilian_morrel$ who wandered about like a ghost awaiting the heavenly mandate for #return# to the tomb
prepare yourself $m_maximilian_morrel$ he said with a #smile# we leave paris #tomorrow# have you #nothing# more to do there asked $m_maximilian_morrel$
no replied $m_de_monte_cristo$ god grant i may not have done too much already the next #day# they indeed left accompanied only by $monsieur_baptistin$
$haydée$ had taken away $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ and $m_bertuccio$ remained with $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #chapter# the departure the recent #event# formed the theme of #conversation# throughout all paris
$m_emmanuel$ and his #wife# conversed with natural #astonishment# in their little #apartment# in the rue meslay upon the three successive sudden and most unexpected catastrophes of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and $m_noirtier_de_villefort$
$m_maximilian_morrel$ who was paying them a #visit# listened to their #conversation# or rather was present at it plunged in his accustomed state of apathy
indeed said $mademoiselle_julie$ might we not almost fancy $m_emmanuel$ that those #people# so rich so happy but #yesterday# had forgotten in their prosperity that an evil genius like the wicked fairies in perrault #story# who present themselves unbidden at a wedding or baptism
hovered over them and appeared all at once to revenge himself for their fatal neglect what a dire #misfortune# said $m_emmanuel$ thinking of $m_albert_de_morcerf$ and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
what dreadful sufferings said $mademoiselle_julie$ remembering $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ but whom with a delicacy natural to #woman# she did not #name# before her #brother#
if the supreme being has directed the fatal blow said $m_emmanuel$ it must be that he in his great goodness has perceived #nothing# in the past #life# of these #people# to merit mitigation of their awful punishment
when my #father# with a #pistol# in his #hand# was once on the #point# of committing suicide had #anyone# then said
do you not form a very rash judgment $m_emmanuel$ said $mademoiselle_julie$ this #man# deserves his misery would not that #person# have been deceived
yes but your #father# was not allowed to fall a being was commissioned to arrest the fatal #hand# of #death# about to descend on him
$m_emmanuel$ had scarcely uttered these #word# when the #sound# of the bell was heard the well known signal given by the porter that a visitor had arrived
nearly at the same #instant# the #door# was opened and the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ appeared on the threshold the young #people# uttered a #cry# of #joy# while $m_maximilian_morrel$ raised his #head# but let it fall again immediately
$m_maximilian_morrel$ said the #count# without appearing to notice the different impressions which his #presence# produced on the little circle
yes said $m_de_monte_cristo$ has it not been agreed that i should take you with me and did i not tell you #yesterday# to prepare for departure
i come to seek you to seek me repeated $m_maximilian_morrel$ as if awakening from a #dream# i am ready said $m_maximilian_morrel$
i came expressly to #wish# them farewell whither are you going #count# asked $mademoiselle_julie$ in the first instance to marseilles #madame#
to marseilles exclaimed the young couple yes and i take your #brother# with me oh #count# said $mademoiselle_julie$ #will# you restore him to us cured of his melancholy
$m_maximilian_morrel$ turned away to conceal the confusion of his #countenance# you perceive then that he is not happy said the #count#
yes replied the young #woman# and #fear# much that he finds our home but a dull #one# i #will# undertake to divert him replied the #count#
i am ready to accompany you #sir# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ adieu my kind #friend# $m_emmanuel$ $mademoiselle_julie$ farewell how farewell exclaimed $mademoiselle_julie$ do you leave us thus so suddenly without any preparations for your journey without even a passport
needless delays but increase the #grief# of parting said $m_de_monte_cristo$ and $m_maximilian_morrel$ has doubtless provided himself with #everything# requisite at least i advised him to do so
i have a passport and my clothes are ready packed said $m_maximilian_morrel$ in his tranquil but mournful #manner#
good said $m_de_monte_cristo$ smiling in these prompt arrangements we recognize the #order# of a well disciplined #soldier# and you leave us said $mademoiselle_julie$
at a #moment# warning you do not give us a #day# no not even an #hour# before your departure
my #carriage# is at the #door# #madame# and i must be in rome in five #day# but does $m_maximilian_morrel$ go to rome
exclaimed $m_emmanuel$ i am going wherever it may please the #count# to take me said $m_maximilian_morrel$ with a #smile# full of #grief#
i am under his #order# for the next #month# oh heavens how strangely he expresses himself #count# said $mademoiselle_julie$
$m_maximilian_morrel$ goes with me said the #count# in his kindest and most persuasive #manner# therefore do not make yourself uneasy on your #brother# #account#
once more farewell my dear sister $m_emmanuel$ adieu $m_maximilian_morrel$ repeated his carelessness and indifference touch me to the #heart# said $mademoiselle_julie$
oh $m_maximilian_morrel$ maximilian you are certainly concealing #something# from us pshaw said $m_de_monte_cristo$ you #will# see him #return# to you gay smiling and joyful
$m_maximilian_morrel$ cast a #look# of disdain almost of anger on the #count# we must leave you said $m_de_monte_cristo$
before you quit us #count# said $mademoiselle_julie$ #will# you permit us to express to you all that the #other# #day# #madame# interrupted the #count# taking her two #hand# in his
all that you could say in #word# would never express what i read in your #eye# the #thought# of your #heart# are fully understood by mine
like benefactors in romances i should have left you without seeing you again but that would have been a virtue beyond my #strength# because i am a weak and vain #man# fond of the tender kind and thankful #glance# of my #fellow# creatures
on the eve of departure i carry my egotism so far as to say do not forget me my kind #friend# for probably you #will# never see me again
never see you again exclaimed $m_emmanuel$ while two large #tear# rolled down $mademoiselle_julie$ cheeks never behold you again
it is not a #man# then but some angel that leaves us and this angel is on the #point# of returning to heaven after having appeared on #earth# to do good
say not so quickly returned $m_de_monte_cristo$ say not so my #friend# angels never err celestial beings remain where they #wish# to be
fate is not more powerful than they it is they who on the #contrary# overcome fate no $m_emmanuel$ i am but a #man# and your admiration is as unmerited as your #word# are sacrilegious
and pressing his #lip# on the #hand# of $mademoiselle_julie$ who rushed into his #arm# he extended his #other# #hand# to $m_emmanuel$ then tearing himself from this abode of peace and #happiness# he made a #sign# to $m_maximilian_morrel$ who followed him passively with the indifference which had been perceptible in him ever since the #death# of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ had so stunned him
and the #count# pressed her #hand# in reply as he had done eleven #year# before on the #staircase# leading to $m_maximilian_morrel$ #study#
restore my #brother# to peace and #happiness# whispered $mademoiselle_julie$ to $m_de_monte_cristo$ you still confide then in sinbad the #sailor# asked he smiling
oh yes was the ready #answer# well then sleep in peace and put your trust in the lord
as we have before said the post chaise was waiting four powerful #horse# were already pawing the #ground# with impatience while $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ apparently just arrived from a long walk was standing at the #foot# of the #step# his #face# bathed in perspiration
well asked the #count# in arabic have you been to see the old #man# $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ made a #sign# in the affirmative
and have you placed the #letter# before him as i ordered you to do the slave respectfully signalized that he had
$ali_pasha_of_yanina$ placed himself in the #light# so that his #master# might see him distinctly and then imitating in his intelligent #manner# the #countenance# of the old #man# he closed his #eye# as $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ was in the custom of doing when saying
and what did he say or rather do yes good he accepts said $m_de_monte_cristo$ now let us go
these #word# had scarcely escaped him when the #carriage# was on its #way# and the #foot# of the #horse# struck a shower of sparks from the pavement
#half# an #hour# had passed when the #carriage# stopped suddenly the #count# had just pulled the silken check string which was fastened to $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ #finger#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ settled himself in his #corner# without uttering a #word# the nubian immediately descended and opened the #carriage# #door# it was a lovely starlight #night#
they had just reached the top of the hill villejuif from whence paris appears like a sombre #sea# tossing its #million# of phosphoric waves into #light# waves indeed more noisy more passionate more changeable more furious more greedy than those of the tempestuous ocean waves which never #rest# as those of the #sea# sometimes
do waves ever dashing ever foaming ever ingulfing what falls within their grasp the #count# stood alone and at a #sign# from his #hand# the #carriage# went on for a short #distance#
when he had fixed his piercing #look# on this modern babylon which equally engages the contemplation of the religious enthusiast the materialist and the scoffer great city murmured he inclining his #head# and joining his #hand# as if in prayer
with folded #arm# he gazed for some #time# upon the great city less than six #month# have elapsed since first i entered thy #gate#
i believe that the spirit of god led my #step# to thee and that he also enables me to quit thee in triumph the #secret# cause of my #presence# within thy #wall# i have confided alone to him who only has had the #power# to read my #heart#
god only knows that i retire from thee without pride or hatred but not without many regrets he only knows that the #power# confided to me has never been made subservient to my personal good or to any useless cause
oh great city it is in thy palpitating bosom that i have found that which i sought like a patient miner i have dug deep into thy very entrails to root out evil thence
now my #work# is accomplished my mission is terminated now thou canst neither afford me pain nor #pleasure# adieu paris adieu
his #look# wandered over the vast plain like that of some genius of the #night# he passed his #hand# over his #brow# got into the #carriage# the #door# was closed on him and the vehicle quickly disappeared down the #other# #side# of the hill in a whirlwind of dust and #noise#
ten leagues were passed and not a single #word# was uttered $m_maximilian_morrel$ was dreaming and $m_de_monte_cristo$ was looking at the dreamer
$m_maximilian_morrel$ said the #count# to him at #length# do you repent having followed me no #count# but to leave paris
if i #thought# #happiness# might await you in paris $m_maximilian_morrel$ i would have left you there $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ reposes within the #wall# of paris and to leave paris is like losing her a second #time#
the #friend# that we have lost do not repose in the bosom of the #earth# but are buried deep in our #heart# and it has been thus ordained that we may always be accompanied by them
i have two #friend# who in this #way# never depart from me the #one# who gave me being and the #other# who conferred knowledge and intelligence on me
$m_maximilian_morrel$ said the #count# their spirits live in me i consult them when doubtful and if i ever do any good it is due to their beneficent counsels
listen to the #voice# of your #heart# $m_maximilian_morrel$ and ask it whether you ought to preserve this melancholy exterior towards me
my #friend# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ the #voice# of my #heart# is very sorrowful and #promise# me #nothing# but #misfortune#
the soul forms its own horizons your soul is darkened and consequently the sky of the future appears stormy and unpromising
it is the #way# of weakened #mind# to see #everything# through a black cloud that may possibly be true said $m_maximilian_morrel$ and he again subsided into his thoughtful mood
towns fled from them like #shadow# on their path and #tree# shaken by the first winds of autumn seemed like giants madly rushing on to meet them and retreating as rapidly when once reached
the journey was performed with that marvellous rapidity which the unlimited #power# of the #count# ever commanded the following #morning# they arrived at châlons where the #count# steamboat waited for them
the #boat# was built for speed her two paddle wheels were like two wings with which she skimmed the #water# like a bird
$m_maximilian_morrel$ was not insensible to that sensation of delight which is generally experienced in passing rapidly through the #air# and the wind which occasionally raised the #hair# from his #forehead# seemed on the #point# of dispelling momentarily the clouds collected there
as the #distance# increased between the #traveller# and paris almost superhuman serenity appeared to surround the #count# he might have been taken for an exile about to revisit his native land
ere long marseilles presented herself to view marseilles white fervid full of #life# and energy marseilles the younger sister of tyre and carthage the successor to them in the empire of the mediterranean marseilles old yet always young
powerful memories were stirred within them by the #sight# of the round tower fort saint nicolas the city hall designed by puget the port with its brick quays where they had both played in childhood and it was with #one# accord that they stopped on the canebière
without the loss of an #instant# the #carriage# was placed on #board# and the two #traveller# embarked without delay a #vessel# was setting sail for algiers on #board# of which the bustle usually attending departure prevailed
the passengers and their relations crowded on the deck #friend# taking a tender but sorrowful leave of each #other# some weeping #other# noisy in their #grief#
the whole forming a spectacle that might be exciting even to those who witnessed similar #sight# daily but which had no #power# to disturb the current of #thought# that had taken #possession# of the #mind# of $m_maximilian_morrel$ from the #moment# he had set #foot# on the broad pavement of the quay
here said he leaning heavily on the #arm# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ here is the #spot# where my #father# stopped when the $pharaon$ entered the port it was here that the good old #man# whom you saved from #death# and dishonor threw himself into my #arm#
i yet feel his warm #tear# on my #face# and his were not the only #tear# shed for many who witnessed our meeting wept also
$m_de_monte_cristo$ gently smiled and said i was there at the same #time# pointing to the #corner# of a #street#
as he spoke and in the very direction he indicated a groan expressive of bitter #grief# was heard and a #woman# was seen waving her #hand# to a passenger on #board# the #vessel# about to sail
$m_de_monte_cristo$ looked at her with an #emotion# that must have been remarked by $m_maximilian_morrel$ had not his #eye# been fixed on the #vessel#
oh heavens exclaimed $m_maximilian_morrel$ i do not deceive myself that young #man# who is waving his hat that youth in the uniform of a lieutenant is $m_albert_de_morcerf$
the #count# smiled as he was in the habit of doing when he did not want to make any reply and he again turned towards the veiled #woman# who soon disappeared at the #corner# of the #street#
yes said $m_de_monte_cristo$ i recognized him how so you were looking the #other# #way# turning to his #friend#
dear $m_maximilian_morrel$ said the #count# have you #nothing# to do in this land i have to weep over the grave of my #father# replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ in a broken #voice#
well then go wait for me there and i #will# soon join you you leave me then yes i also have a pious #visit# to pay
$m_maximilian_morrel$ allowed his #hand# to fall into that which the #count# extended to him then with an inexpressibly sorrowful inclination of the #head# he quitted the #count# and bent his #step# to the east of the city
$m_de_monte_cristo$ remained on the same #spot# until $m_maximilian_morrel$ was out of #sight# he then walked slowly towards the allées de meilhan to seek out a small $house_of_peers$ with which our readers were made familiar at the beginning of this #story#
it yet stood under the shade of the fine avenue of lime #tree# which forms #one# of the most frequent walks of the idlers of marseilles covered by an immense vine which spreads its aged and blackened branches over the #stone# front burnt yellow by the ardent sun of the south
two #stone# #step# worn away by the friction of many #foot# led to the #door# which was made of three planks the #door# had never been painted or varnished so great cracks yawned in it during the dry season to close again when the rains came on
the $house_of_peers$ with all its crumbling antiquity and apparent misery was yet cheerful and picturesque and was the same that old $m_dantès$ formerly inhabited
the only difference being that the old #man# occupied merely the garret while the whole $house_of_peers$ was now placed at the command of $mercédès$ by the #count#
the #woman# whom the #count# had seen leave the ship with so much regret entered this $house_of_peers$ she had scarcely closed the #door# after her when $m_de_monte_cristo$ appeared at the #corner# of a #street# so that he found and lost her again almost at the same #instant#
the worn out #step# were old acquaintances of his he knew better than #anyone# else how to open that weather beaten #door# with the large headed nail which served to raise the latch within
he entered without knocking or giving any #other# intimation of his #presence# as if he had been a #friend# or the #master# of the #place#
at the #end# of a passage paved with bricks was a little #garden# bathed in sunshine and rich in warmth and #light#
in this #garden# $mercédès$ had found at the #place# indicated by the #count# the #sum# of #money# which he through a sense of delicacy had described as having been placed there twenty four #year# previously
$m_de_monte_cristo$ on stepping into the $house_of_peers$ heard a sigh that was almost a deep sob he looked in the direction whence it came and there under an arbor of virginia jessamine with its thick foliage and beautiful long purple flowers he saw $mercédès$ seated with her #head# bowed and weeping bitterly
she had raised her veil and with her #face# hidden by her #hand# was giving free scope to the sighs and #tear# which had been so long restrained by the #presence# of her #son#
the #tree# of the #garden# were easily seen from the #step# of the #street# #door# $m_de_monte_cristo$ advanced a few #step# which were heard on the gravel
$mercédès$ raised her #head# and uttered a #cry# of #terror# on beholding a #man# before her #madame# said the #count#
it is no longer in my #power# to restore you to #happiness# but i offer you consolation #will# you deign to accept it as coming from a #friend#
i am indeed most wretched replied $mercédès$ alone in the #world# i had but my #son# and he has left me
he feels that every #man# owes a tribute to his #country# some contribute their talents #other# their industry these devote their #blood# those their nightly labors to the same cause
had he remained with you his #life# must have become a hateful burden nor would he have participated in your #grief#
he possesses a noble #heart# #madame# replied the #count# and he has acted rightly he #will# increase in #strength# and #honor# by struggling with adversity which he #will# convert into prosperity
leave him to build up the future for you and i venture to say you #will# confide it to safe #hand#
oh replied the wretched #woman# mournfully shaking her #head# the prosperity of which you speak and which from the bottom of my #heart# i pray god in his mercy to grant him i can never enjoy
the bitter cup of adversity has been drained by me to the very dregs and i feel that the grave is not far distant
you have acted kindly #count# in bringing me back to the #place# where i have enjoyed so much bliss
alas said $m_de_monte_cristo$ your #word# sear and embitter my #heart# the more so as you have every #reason# to hate me
i ought to meet #death# on the same #spot# where #happiness# was once all my own i have been the cause of all your #misfortune# but why do you #pity# instead of blaming me
you render me still more unhappy hate you blame you you $edmond_dantès$ hate reproach the #man# that has spared my #son# #life#
for was it not your fatal and sanguinary intention to destroy that #son# of whom de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ was so proud
the #count# looked up and fixed his #eye# on $mercédès$ who arose partly from her #seat# and extended both her #hand# towards him
oh #look# at me closely and discover if you can even the semblance of a reproach in me oh #look# at me continued she with a #feeling# of profound melancholy
my #eye# no longer dazzle by their brilliancy for the #time# has long fled since i used to #smile# on $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ who anxiously looked out for me from the #window# of yonder garret then inhabited by his old #father#
#year# of #grief# have created an abyss between those #day# and the present i neither reproach you nor hate you my #friend#
oh no $edmond_dantès$ it is myself that i blame myself that i hate oh miserable creature that i am cried she clasping her #hand# and raising her #eye# to heaven
i once possessed piety innocence and #love# the three ingredients of the #happiness# of angels and now what am i
$m_de_monte_cristo$ approached her and silently took her #hand# no said she withdrawing it gently no my #friend# touch me not
they were influenced by hatred by avarice and by self #love# but i was base and for want of courage acted against my judgment
nay do not press my #hand# $edmond_dantès$ you are thinking i am sure of some kind speech to console me but do not utter it to me reserve it for #other# more worthy of your kindness
see and she exposed her #face# completely to view see #misfortune# has silvered my #hair# my #eye# have shed so many #tear# that they are encircled by a rim of purple and my #brow# is wrinkled
you $edmond_dantès$ on the #contrary# you are still young handsome dignified it is because you have had faith because you have had #strength# because you have had trust in god and god has sustained you
you have spared me yet of all those who have fallen under your vengeance i was the most guilty but as for me i have been a coward i have denied god and he has abandoned me
$m_de_monte_cristo$ took her #hand# and imprinted a kiss on it but she herself felt that it was a kiss of no greater warmth than he would have bestowed on the #hand# of some marble statue of a saint
$mercédès$ burst into #tear# her #woman# #heart# was breaking under its load of memories it often happens continued she that a first fault destroys the prospects of a whole #life#
what good has it done me to mourn for you eternally in the #secret# recesses of my #heart# only to make a #woman# of thirty nine #look# like a #woman# of fifty
i believed you dead why did i survive you why having recognized you and i the only #one# to do so
why was i able to save my #son# alone ought i not also to have rescued the #man# that i had accepted for a #husband# guilty though he were
oh merciful heavens was i not accessory to his #death# by my supine insensibility by my contempt for him not remembering or not willing to remember that it was for my sake he had become a traitor and a perjurer
in what am i benefited by accompanying my #son# so far since i now abandon him and allow him to depart alone to the baneful climate of africa
oh i have been base cowardly i tell you i have abjured my affections and like all renegades i am of evil omen to those who surround me
yet i let him die what do i say no $mercédès$ said $m_de_monte_cristo$ no you judge yourself with too much severity
still i was but an agent led on by an invisible and offended deity who chose not to withhold the fatal blow that i was destined to hurl
i take that god to witness at whose #foot# i have prostrated myself daily for the last ten #year# that i would have sacrificed my #life# to you and with my #life# the projects that were indissolubly linked with it
you are a noble minded #woman# and it was your #grief# that disarmed me but and i say it with some pride $mercédès$
examine the past and the present and endeavor to dive into futurity and then say whether i am not a divine instrument
the most dreadful #misfortune# the most frightful sufferings the abandonment of all those who loved me the persecution of those who did not know me formed the trials of my youth when suddenly from captivity solitude misery i was restored to #light# and #liberty# and became the possessor of a #fortune# so brilliant so unbounded so unheard of that i must have been blind not to be conscious that god had endowed me with it to #work# out his own great designs
god needed me and i lived from that #time# i looked upon this #fortune# as #something# confided to me for a particular #purpose#
not a #thought# was given to a #life# which you once $mercédès$ had the #power# to render blissful not #one# #hour# of peaceful calm was mine but i felt myself driven on like an exterminating angel
like adventurous #captain# about to embark on some enterprise full of danger i laid in my provisions i loaded my weapons i collected every #mean# of attack and defence i inured my #body# to the most violent exercises my soul to the bitterest trials i taught my #arm# to slay my #eye# to behold excruciating sufferings and my mouth to #smile# at the most horrid spectacles
good natured confiding and forgiving as i had been i became revengeful cunning and wicked or rather immovable as fate then i launched out into the path that was opened to me
i overcame every obstacle and reached the goal but woe to those who stood in my pathway enough said $mercédès$ enough $edmond_dantès$
believe me that she who alone recognized you has been the only #one# to comprehend you and had she crossed your path and you had crushed her like #glass# still $edmond_dantès$ still she must have admired you
like the gulf between me and the past there is an abyss between you $edmond_dantès$ and the #rest# of mankind and i tell you freely that the comparison i draw between you and #other# #man# #will# ever be #one# of my greatest tortures
no there is #nothing# in the #world# to resemble you in worth and goodness but we must say farewell $edmond_dantès$ and let us #part#
before i leave you $mercédès$ have you no request to make said the #count# i #desire# but #one# #thing# in this #world# $edmond_dantès$ the #happiness# of my #son#
pray to the almighty to spare his #life# and i #will# take upon myself to promote his #happiness#
#thank# you $edmond_dantès$ but have you no request to make for yourself $mercédès$ for myself i want #nothing#
i live as it were between two graves #one# is that of $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ lost to me long long since he had my #love#
that #word# ill becomes my faded #lip# now but it is a memory dear to my #heart# and #one# that i would not lose for all that the #world# contains
the #other# grave is that of the #man# who met his #death# from the #hand# of $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ i approve of the deed but i must pray for the dead
your #son# shall be happy $mercédès$ repeated the #count# then i shall enjoy as much #happiness# as this #world# can possibly confer
to say that i shall live here like the $mercédès$ of #other# #time# gaining my bread by labor would not be true nor would you believe me
but what are your intentions $mercédès$ smiled sadly i have no longer the #strength# to do #anything# but to spend my #day# in prayer
however i shall have no occasion to #work# for the little #sum# of #money# buried by you and which i found in the #place# you mentioned #will# be sufficient to maintain me
rumor #will# probably be busy respecting me my occupations my #manner# of living that #will# signify but little that concerns god you and myself
i do not say it to blame you but you made an unnecessary sacrifice in relinquishing the whole of the #fortune# amassed by de $m_albert_de_morcerf$ #half# of it at least by #right# belonged to you in virtue of your vigilance and economy
i perceive what you are intending to propose to me but i cannot accept it $edmond_dantès$ my #son# would not permit it
$mercédès$ said the #count# #nothing# shall be done without the full approbation of $m_albert_de_morcerf$
i #will# make myself acquainted with his intentions and #will# submit to them but if he be willing to accept my offers #will# you oppose them
you well know $edmond_dantès$ that i am no longer a reasoning creature i have no #will# unless it be the #will# never to decide
i have been so overwhelmed by the many storms that have broken over my #head# that i am become passive in the #hand# of the almighty like a sparrow in the talons of an eagle
i live because it is not ordained for me to die if succor be sent to me i #will# accept it
it is not so we should evince our resignation to the #will# of heaven on the #contrary# we are all free agents
exclaimed $mercédès$ if it were so if i possessed free #will# but without the #power# to render that #will# efficacious it would drive me to #despair#
ah #madame# said $m_de_monte_cristo$ you should not talk thus alas $m_de_monte_cristo$ dropped his #head# and shrank from the vehemence of her #grief#
#will# you not even say you #will# see me again he asked on the #contrary# we shall meet again said $mercédès$ pointing to heaven with solemnity
i tell you so to prove to you that i still #hope# and after pressing her own trembling #hand# upon that of the #count# $mercédès$ rushed up the stairs and disappeared
but $mercédès$ did not witness his departure although she was seated at the little #window# of the #room# which had been occupied by old $m_dantès$
her #eye# were straining to see the ship which was carrying her #son# over the vast #sea# but still her #voice# involuntarily murmured softly $edmond_dantès$ edmond $edmond_dantès$
the #count# departed with a sad #heart# from the $house_of_peers$ in which he had left $mercédès$ probably never to behold her again
$m_de_monte_cristo$ slowly left the $house_of_peers$ and turned towards the quay #chapter# the past since the #death# of little $edward$ a great change had taken #place# in $m_de_monte_cristo$
having reached the summit of his vengeance by a long and tortuous path he saw an abyss of #doubt# yawning before him
more than this the #conversation# which had just taken #place# between $mercédès$ and himself had awakened so many recollections in his #heart# that he felt it necessary to combat with them
a #man# of the #count# temperament could not long indulge in that melancholy which can exist in common #mind# but which destroys superior #one#
he #thought# he must have made an error in his calculations if he now found cause to blame himself i cannot have deceived myself he said
i must #look# upon the past in a false #light# what he continued can i have been following a false path can
the #end# which i proposed be a mistaken #end# can #one# #hour# have sufficed to prove to an architect that the #work# upon which he founded all his #hope# was an impossible if not a sacrilegious undertaking
i cannot reconcile myself to this #idea# it would madden me the #reason# why i am now dissatisfied is that i have not a clear appreciation of the past
my #position# is like that of a #person# wounded in a #dream# he feels the wound though he cannot recollect when he received it
come then thou regenerate #man# thou extravagant prodigal thou awakened sleeper thou all powerful visionary thou invincible millionaire once again review thy past #life# of starvation and wretchedness revisit the #scene# where fate and #misfortune# conducted and where #despair# received thee
too many #diamond# too much #gold# and splendor are now reflected by the mirror in which $m_de_monte_cristo$ seeks to behold $m_dantès$
hide thy #diamond# bury thy #gold# shroud thy splendor exchange riches for poverty #liberty# for a #prison# a living #body# for a corpse
the past like the #country# through which we walk becomes indistinct as we advance as he thus reasoned $m_de_monte_cristo$ walked down the rue de la caisserie
it was the same through which twenty four #year# ago he had been conducted by a silent and nocturnal guard the #house# #today# so smiling and animated were on that #night# dark mute and closed
only now it is broad daylight instead of #night# it is the sun which brightens the #place# and makes it appear so cheerful
he proceeded towards the quay by the rue saint laurent and advanced to the consigne it was the #point# where he had embarked
$m_de_monte_cristo$ called the owner who immediately rowed up to him with the eagerness of a boatman hoping for a good fare
and yet they were the same murmured $m_de_monte_cristo$ a #pleasure# #boat# with striped awning was going by the weather was magnificent and the excursion a treat
the #sea# smooth as crystal was now and then disturbed by the leaping of fish which were pursued by some unseen #enemy# and sought for safety in another element while on the extreme verge of the horizon might be seen the fishermen #boat# white and graceful as the #sea# gull or the merchant #vessel# bound for corsica or spain
but notwithstanding the serene sky the gracefully formed #boat# and the golden #light# in which the whole #scene# was bathed the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ wrapped in his cloak could think only of this terrible voyage the details of which were #one# by #one# recalled to his memory
the solitary #light# burning at the catalans that first #sight# of the château if which told him whither they were leading him the struggle with the gendarmes when he wished to throw himself overboard his #despair# when he found himself vanquished and the sensation when the muzzle of the carbine touched his #forehead# all these were brought before him in vivid and frightful reality
like the streams which the heat of the summer has dried up and which after the autumnal storms gradually begin oozing drop by drop so did the #count# feel his #heart# gradually fill with the bitterness which formerly nearly overwhelmed $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$
clear sky swift flitting #boat# and brilliant sunshine disappeared the heavens were hung with black and the gigantic structure of the château if seemed like the phantom of a mortal #enemy#
as they reached the shore the #count# instinctively shrunk to the extreme #end# of the #boat# and the owner was obliged to call out in his sweetest #tone# of #voice#
the sun red and flaming was sinking into the embrace of the welcoming ocean #sir# we are at the landing
$m_de_monte_cristo$ remembered that on that very #spot# on the same #rock# he had been violently dragged by the guards who forced him to ascend the slope at the #point# of their bayonets
each stroke of the oar seemed to awaken a new throng of #idea# which sprang up with the flying spray of the #sea#
there had been no #prisoner# confined in the château if since the revolution of july it was only inhabited by a guard kept there for the prevention of smuggling
the journey had seemed very long to $m_dantès$ but $m_de_monte_cristo$ found it equally short a concierge waited at the #door# to exhibit to visitors this monument of curiosity once a #scene# of #terror#
the #count# inquired whether any of the ancient #jailer# were still there but they had all been pensioned or had passed on to some #other# employment
the concierge who attended him had only been there since he visited his own dungeon he again beheld the dull #light# vainly endeavoring to penetrate the narrow #opening#
his #eye# rested upon the #spot# where had stood his #bed# since then removed and behind the #bed# the new #stone# indicated where the breach made by the $abbé_faria$ had been
$m_de_monte_cristo$ felt his limbs tremble he seated himself upon a log of wood are there any #story# connected with this #prison# besides the #one# relating to the poisoning of mirabeau
asked the #count# are there any traditions respecting these dismal abodes in which it is difficult to believe #man# can ever have imprisoned their #fellow# creatures
yes #sir# indeed the #jailer# antoine told me #one# connected with this very dungeon $m_de_monte_cristo$ shuddered antoine had been his #jailer#
he had almost forgotten his #name# and #face# but at the mention of the #name# he recalled his #person# as he used to see it the #face# encircled by a beard wearing the brown jacket the bunch of keys the jingling of which he still seemed to hear
the #count# turned around and fancied he saw him in the corridor rendered still darker by the torch carried by the concierge
yes relate it said $m_de_monte_cristo$ pressing his #hand# to his #heart# to still its violent beatings he felt afraid of hearing his own history
this dungeon said the concierge was it appears some #time# ago occupied by a very dangerous #prisoner# the more so since he was full of industry
another #person# was confined in the château at the same #time# but he was not wicked he was only a poor mad #priest#
would you like to hear the #story# #sir# ah indeed mad repeated $m_de_monte_cristo$ and what was his mania
$m_de_monte_cristo$ raised his #eye# but he could not see the heavens there was a #stone# veil between him and the firmament
he #thought# that there had been no less thick a veil before the #eye# of those to whom $abbé_faria$ offered the #treasure#
he offered #million# to #anyone# who would set him at #liberty# could the #prisoner# see each #other# he asked
oh no #sir# it was expressly forbidden but they eluded the vigilance of the guards and made a passage from #one# dungeon to the #other#
oh it must have been the young #man# certainly for he was strong and industrious while the #abbé# was aged and weak besides his #mind# was too vacillating to allow him to carry out an #idea#
however be that as it may the young #man# made a tunnel how or by what #mean# no #one# knows but he made it and there is the evidence yet remaining of his #work#
and which of them made this passage blind fools murmured the #count# do you see it and the #man# held the torch to the #wall#
ah yes i see said the #count# in a #voice# hoarse from #emotion# the result was that the two #man# communicated with #one# another how long they did so nobody knows
he carried off the corpse which he placed in his own #bed# with its #face# to the #wall# then he entered the empty dungeon closed the entrance and slipped into the sack which had contained the dead #body#
#one# #day# the old #man# fell ill and died now guess what the young #one# did tell me did you ever hear of such an #idea#
$m_de_monte_cristo$ closed his #eye# and seemed again to experience all the sensations he had felt when the coarse canvas yet moist with the cold dews of #death# had touched his #face#
he fancied that they buried the dead at the château if and imagining they would not expend much labor on the grave of a #prisoner# he calculated on raising the #earth# with his #shoulder# but unfortunately their arrangements at the château frustrated his projects
they never buried the dead they merely attached a heavy cannon ball to the #foot# and then threw them into the #sea#
the young #man# was thrown from the top of the #rock# the corpse was found on the #bed# next #day# and the whole #truth# was guessed for the #man# who performed the office then mentioned what they had not dared to speak of before that at the #moment# the corpse was thrown into the deep they heard a shriek which was almost immediately stifled by the #water# in which it disappeared
the #jailer# continued now this was his project this is what was done the #count# breathed with difficulty the cold drops ran down his #forehead# and his #heart# was full of anguish
the #doubt# i felt was but the commencement of forgetfulness but here the wound reopens and the #heart# again thirsts for vengeance
no he muttered and the #prisoner# he continued aloud was he ever heard of afterwards oh no of #course# not
you can understand that #one# of two #thing# must have happened he must either have fallen flat in which #case# the blow from a height of ninety #foot# must have killed him instantly or he must have fallen upright and then the weight would have dragged him to the bottom where he remained poor #fellow#
then you #pity# him said the #count# ma foi yes though he was in his own element
what do you #mean# the report was that he had been a naval #officer# who had been confined for plotting with the bonapartists
thus the poor #sailor# #life# in the recollection of those who narrate his history his terrible #story# is recited in the chimney #corner# and a shudder is felt at the description of his transit through the #air# to be swallowed by the deep
great is #truth# muttered the #count# #fire# cannot burn nor #water# drown it then the #count# added aloud was his #name# ever known
oh yes but only as no oh $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ villefort murmured the #count# this #scene# must often have haunted thy sleepless #hour#
do you #wish# to see #anything# more #sir# said the concierge yes especially if you #will# show me the poor #abbé# #room#
repeated the #count# who seemed to hear the #voice# of the #abbé# answering him in those very #word# through the #wall# when asked his #name#
ah no yes no come #sir# wait said $m_de_monte_cristo$ i #wish# to take #one# final #glance# around this #room#
this is fortunate said the guide i have forgotten the #other# key go and fetch it
i #will# leave you the torch #sir# no take it away i can see in the dark
they said he was so accustomed to #darkness# that he could see a pin in the darkest #corner# of his dungeon
why you are like no he spent fourteen #year# to arrive at that muttered the #count# the guide carried away the torch
the #count# had spoken correctly scarcely had a few seconds elapsed ere he saw #everything# as distinctly as by daylight then he looked around him and really recognized his dungeon
yes he said there is the #stone# upon which i used to sit there is the impression made by my #shoulder# on the #wall# there is the mark of my #blood# made when #one# #day# i dashed my #head# against the #wall#
i made them #one# #day# to calculate the #age# of my #father# that i might know whether i should find him still living and that of $mercédès$ to know if i should find her still free
oh those figures how well i remember them after finishing that calculation i had a #minute# #hope# i did not reckon upon hunger and infidelity and a bitter laugh escaped the #count#
on the #other# #side# of the dungeon he perceived an inscription the white #letter# of which were still visible on the green #wall#
he saw in fancy the burial of his #father# and the #marriage# of $mercédès$ oh god he read
that was my only prayer at last i no longer begged for #liberty# but memory i dreaded to become mad and forgetful
preserve my memory oh yes he cried oh god thou hast preserved my memory i #thank# thee i #thank# thee
at this #moment# the #light# of the torch was reflected on the #wall# the guide was coming $m_de_monte_cristo$ went to meet him
follow me #sir# and without ascending the stairs the guide conducted him by a subterraneous passage to another entrance there again $m_de_monte_cristo$ was assailed by a multitude of #thought#
the first #thing# that met his #eye# was the meridian drawn by the #abbé# on the #wall# by which he calculated the #time# then he saw the remains of the #bed# on which the poor #prisoner# had died
the #sight# of this instead of exciting the anguish experienced by the #count# in the dungeon filled his #heart# with a soft and grateful sentiment and #tear# fell from his #eye#
this is where the mad #abbé# was kept #sir# and that is where the young #man# entered and the guide pointed to the #opening# which had remained unclosed
from the #appearance# of the #stone# he continued a learned #gentleman# discovered that the #prisoner# might have communicated together for ten #year#
poor #thing# those must have been ten weary #year# $m_dantès$ took some $louis_xviii$ from his #pocket# and gave them to the #man# who had twice unconsciously pitied him
the guide took them thinking them merely a few #piece# of little value but the #light# of the torch revealed their true worth
#sir# he said you have made a mistake you have given me #gold# i know it the concierge looked upon the #count# with surprise
oh it is very simple my good #fellow# i have been a #sailor# and your #story# touched me more than it would #other#
#sir# he cried scarcely able to believe his good #fortune# #sir# i cannot understand your generosity
then #sir# since you are so liberal i ought to offer you #something# what have you to offer to me my #friend#
shells straw #work# #thank# you no #sir# neither of those #something# connected with this #story# really what is it
#something# is always left in a cell inhabited by #one# #prisoner# for fifteen #year# so i began to #sound# the #wall#
listen said the guide i said to myself ah cried $m_de_monte_cristo$ remembering the #abbé# two hiding #place#
after some search i found that the #floor# gave a hollow #sound# near the #head# of the #bed# and at the hearth
yes said the #count# yes i raised the #stone# and found a rope ladder and some tools
how do you know that asked the guide in #astonishment# i do not know i only guess it because that #sort# of #thing# is generally found in #prisoner# cells
yes #sir# a rope ladder and tools and have you them yet no #sir# i sold them to visitors who considered them great curiosities but i have still #something# left
what is it asked the #count# impatiently a #sort# of book written upon strips of cloth go and fetch it my good #fellow# and if it be what i #hope# you #will# do well
i #will# run for it #sir# and the guide went out then the #count# knelt down by the #side# of the #bed# which #death# had converted into an altar
oh second #father# he exclaimed thou who hast given me #liberty# knowledge riches thou who like beings of a superior #order# to ourselves couldst understand the science of good and evil if in the depths of the tomb there still remain #something# within us which can respond to the #voice# of those who are left on #earth# if after #death# the soul ever revisit the #place# where we have lived and suffered then noble #heart# sublime soul then i conjure thee by the paternal #love# thou didst bear me by the filial obedience i vowed to thee grant me some #sign# some revelation
remove from me the remains of #doubt# which if it change not to conviction must become remorse the #count# bowed his #head# and clasped his #hand# together
here #sir# said a #voice# behind him $m_de_monte_cristo$ shuddered and arose the concierge held out the strips of cloth upon which the $abbé_faria$ had spread the riches of his #mind#
the manuscript was the great #work# by the $abbé_faria$ upon the kingdoms of italy the #count# seized it hastily his #eye# immediately fell upon the epigraph and he read
thou shalt #tear# out the dragons teeth and shall trample the lions under #foot# saith the lord ah he exclaimed here is my #answer#
#thank# #father# #thank# and #feeling# in his #pocket# he took thence a small #pocket# book which contained ten bank #note# each of #franc#
yes but only on condition that you #will# not open it till i am gone and placing in his breast the #treasure# he had just found which was more valuable to him than the richest jewel he rushed out of the corridor and reaching his #boat# cried to marseilles
here he said take this #pocket# book do you give it to me then as he departed he fixed his #eye# upon the gloomy #prison#
woe he cried to those who confined me in that wretched #prison# and woe to those who forgot that i was there
as he repassed the catalans the #count# turned around and burying his #head# in his cloak murmured the #name# of a #woman#
the victory was complete twice he had overcome his #doubt# the #name# he pronounced in a #voice# of tenderness amounting almost to #love# was that of $haydée$
on landing the #count# turned towards the cemetery where he felt sure of finding $m_maximilian_morrel$ he too ten #year# ago had piously sought out a tomb and sought it vainly
he who returned to france with #million# had been unable to find the grave of his #father# who had perished from hunger
$m_maximilian_morrel$ had indeed placed a cross over the #spot# but it had fallen down and the grave digger had burnt it as he did all the old wood in the churchyard
dying in the #arm# of his #child# he had been by them laid by the #side# of his #wife# who had preceded him in eternity by two #year#
two large slabs of marble on which were inscribed their #name# were placed on either #side# of a little enclosure railed in and shaded by four cypress #tree#
the worthy merchant had been more fortunate $m_maximilian_morrel$ was leaning against #one# of these mechanically fixing his #eye# on the graves
his #grief# was so profound that he was nearly unconscious $m_maximilian_morrel$ said the #count# you should not #look# on the graves but there and he pointed upwards
the dead are everywhere said $m_maximilian_morrel$ did you not yourself tell me so as we left paris $m_maximilian_morrel$ said the #count# you asked me during the journey to allow you to remain some #day# at marseilles
do you still #wish# to do so i have no #wish# #count# only i fancy i could pass the #time# less painfully here than anywhere else
so much the better for i must leave you but i carry your #word# with me do i not
no you #will# not forget it because you are a #man# of #honor# $m_maximilian_morrel$ because you have taken an oath and are about to do so again
ah #count# i shall forget it oh #count# have #pity# upon me i am so unhappy
i have known a #man# much more unfortunate than you $m_maximilian_morrel$ impossible alas said $m_de_monte_cristo$
it is the infirmity of our #nature# always to believe ourselves much more unhappy than those who groan by our #side#
what can be more wretched than the #man# who has lost all he loved and desired in the #world#
listen $m_maximilian_morrel$ and pay #attention# to what i am about to tell you i knew a #man# who like you had fixed all his #hope# of #happiness# upon a #woman#
he was about to marry her when #one# of the caprices of fate which would almost make us #doubt# the goodness of providence if that providence did not afterwards reveal itself by proving that all is but a #mean# of conducting to an #end# #one# of those caprices deprived him of his mistress of the future of which he had dreamed for in his blindness he forgot he could only read the present and cast him into a dungeon
he was young he had an old #father# whom he loved a betrothed bride whom he adored ah said $m_maximilian_morrel$ #one# quits a dungeon in a week a #month# or a #year#
he remained there fourteen #year# $m_maximilian_morrel$ said the #count# placing his #hand# on the young #man# #shoulder# $m_maximilian_morrel$ shuddered
fourteen #year# he muttered fourteen #year# repeated the #count# during that #time# he had many #moment# of #despair#
he also $m_maximilian_morrel$ like you considered himself the unhappiest of #man# well asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ well at the height of his #despair# god assisted him through human #mean#
at first perhaps he did not recognize the infinite mercy of the lord but at last he took patience and waited
#one# #day# he miraculously left the #prison# transformed rich powerful his first #cry# was for his #father# but that #father# was dead
yes but your #father# died in your #arm# happy respected rich and full of #year# his #father# died poor despairing almost doubtful of providence and when his #son# sought his grave ten #year# afterwards his tomb had disappeared and no #one# could say there sleeps the #father# you so well loved
my #father# too is dead said $m_maximilian_morrel$ oh exclaimed $m_maximilian_morrel$ he was then a more unhappy #son# than you $m_maximilian_morrel$ for he could not even find his #father# grave
but then he had the #woman# he loved still remaining you are deceived $m_maximilian_morrel$ that #woman#
she was dead worse than that she was faithless and had married #one# of the persecutors of her betrothed you see then $m_maximilian_morrel$ that he was a more unhappy lover than you
and has he found consolation he has at least found peace and does he ever expect to be happy
he #hope# so $m_maximilian_morrel$ the young #man# #head# fell on his breast you have my #promise# he said after a #minute# pause extending his #hand# to $m_de_monte_cristo$
on the th a yacht #will# wait for you in the port of bastia it #will# be called the eurus
only remember on the th of october $m_maximilian_morrel$ i shall expect you at the #island# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ you #will# give your #name# to the #captain# who #will# bring you to me
but #count# do you remember that the th of october #child# replied the #count# not to know the value of a #man# #word#
it is understood is it not i have told you twenty #time# that if you #wish# to die on that #day# i #will# assist you
$m_maximilian_morrel$ farewell do you leave me yes i have #business# in italy i leave you alone in your struggle with #misfortune#
alone with that strong winged eagle which god sends to bear aloft the elect to his #foot# the #story# of ganymede $m_maximilian_morrel$ is not a fable but an allegory
when do you leave immediately the steamer waits and in an #hour# i shall be far from you
#will# you accompany me to the harbor $m_maximilian_morrel$ i am entirely yours #count# $m_maximilian_morrel$ accompanied the #count# to the harbor
the steamer soon disappeared and in an #hour# afterwards as the #count# had said was scarcely distinguishable in the horizon amidst the fogs of the #night#
at the same #time# that the steamer disappeared behind cape morgiou a #man# travelling post on the #road# from florence to rome had just passed the little town of aquapendente
the white steam was ascending like a plume of feathers from the black chimney #chapter# $peppino$ he was travelling fast enough to cover a great deal of #ground# without exciting suspicion
this #man# was dressed in a greatcoat or rather a surtout a little worse for the journey but which exhibited the ribbon of the legion of #honor# still fresh and brilliant a decoration which also ornamented the under coat
he might be recognized not only by these #sign# but also from the accent with which he spoke to the postilion as a frenchman
another #proof# that he was a native of the universal #country# was apparent in the #fact# of his knowing no #other# italian #word# than the terms used in music and which like the goddam of figaro served all possible linguistic requirements
allegro he called out to the postilions at every ascent moderato he cried as they descended and heaven knows there are hills enough between rome and florence by the #way# of aquapendente
on reaching la storta the #point# from whence rome is first visible the #traveller# evinced none of the enthusiastic curiosity which usually leads #stranger# to stand up and endeavor to catch #sight# of the dome of saint peter which may be seen long before any #other# object is distinguishable
no he merely drew a pocketbook from his #pocket# and took from it a #paper# folded in four and after having examined it in a #manner# almost reverential he said good
these two #word# greatly amused the #man# to whom they were addressed i have it still the #carriage# entered by the porta del popolo turned to the left and stopped at the hôtel espagne
the #traveller# alighted ordered a good #dinner# and inquired the address of the $house_of_peers$ of $thomson_french_of_rome$ which was immediately given to him as it was #one# of the most celebrated in rome
old $signor_pastrini$ our former acquaintance received the #traveller# at the #door# hat in #hand# it was situated in the via dei banchi near st peter
ten young descendants of marius and the gracchi barefooted and out at elbows with #one# #hand# resting on the hip and the #other# gracefully curved above the #head# stared at the #traveller# the post chaise and the #horse# to these were added about fifty little vagabonds from the papal states who earned a pittance by diving into the tiber at high #water# from the bridge of st angelo
now as these #street# arabs of rome more fortunate than those of paris understand every language more especially the french they heard the #traveller# #order# an #apartment# a #dinner# and finally inquire the #way# to the $house_of_peers$ of $thomson_french_of_rome$
the result was that when the new comer left the hotel with the cicerone a #man# detached himself from the #rest# of the idlers and without having been seen by the #traveller# and appearing to excite no #attention# from the guide followed the #stranger# with as much skill as a parisian #police# agent would have used
the frenchman had been so impatient to reach the $house_of_peers$ of $thomson_french_of_rome$ that he would not wait for the #horse# to be harnessed but left #word# for the #carriage# to overtake him on the #road# or to wait for him at the #banker# #door#
the frenchman entered leaving in the anteroom his guide who immediately entered into #conversation# with two or three of the industrious idlers who are always to be found in rome at the #door# of banking #house# churches museums or theatres
with the frenchman the #man# who had followed him entered too the frenchman knocked at the inner #door# and entered the first #room# his #shadow# did the same
in rome as everywhere else the arrival of a post chaise is an #event# he reached it before the #carriage# arrived
messrs $thomson_french_of_rome$ inquired the #stranger# an attendant arose at a #sign# from a confidential clerk at the first desk
whom shall i announce said the attendant #baron# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ follow me said the #man# a #door# opened through which the attendant and the #baron# disappeared
the #man# who had followed $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ sat down on a bench the clerk continued to write for the next five #minute# the #man# preserved profound #silence# and remained perfectly motionless
then the pen of the clerk ceased to move over the #paper# he raised his #head# and appearing to be perfectly sure of privacy
ah ha he said here you are $peppino$ yes was the laconic reply you have found out that there is #something# worth having about this large #gentleman#
there is no great merit due to me for we were informed of it you know his #business# here then
$pardieu$ he has come to draw but i dont know how much you #will# know presently my #friend#
very well only do not give me false information as you did the #other# #day# what do you #mean# of whom do you speak
was it the englishman who carried off crowns from here the #other# #day# no he really had crowns and we found them
i #mean# the russian prince who you said had livres and we only found you must have searched badly
$luigi_vampa$ himself searched in that #case# he must either have paid his debts a russian do that
or spent the #money# possibly after all certainly but you must let me make my observations or the frenchman #will# transact his #business# without my knowing the #sum#
$peppino$ nodded and taking a rosary from his #pocket# began to mutter a few prayers while the clerk disappeared through the same #door# by which $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and the attendant had gone out
at the expiration of ten #minute# the clerk returned with a beaming #countenance# well asked $peppino$ of his #friend#
#joy# #joy# the #sum# is large five or six #million# is it not yes you know the amount
on the receipt of the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ why how came you to be so well acquainted with all this
i told you we were informed beforehand then why do you apply to me that i may be sure i have the #right# #man#
yes it is indeed he five #million# a pretty #sum# eh $peppino$ hush here is our #man# the clerk seized his pen and $peppino$ his beads #one# was writing and the #other# praying when the #door# opened
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ looked radiant with #joy# the #banker# accompanied him to the #door# $peppino$ followed $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ according to the arrangements the #carriage# was waiting at the #door#
the guide held the #door# open guides are useful #people# who #will# #turn# their #hand# to #anything# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ leaped into the #carriage# like a young #man# of twenty
the cicerone reclosed the #door# and sprang up by the #side# of the coachman $peppino$ mounted the #seat# behind #will# your #excellency# #visit# saint peter asked the cicerone
i did not come to rome to see said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ aloud then he added softly with an avaricious #smile#
i came to touch and he rapped his #pocket# book in which he had just placed a #letter# then your #excellency# is going
ten #minute# afterwards the #baron# entered his #apartment# and $peppino$ stationed himself on the bench outside the #door# of the hotel after having whispered #something# in the ear of #one# of the descendants of marius and the gracchi whom we noticed at the beginning of the #chapter# who immediately ran down the #road# leading to the capitol at his fullest speed
to the hotel casa $signor_pastrini$ said the cicerone to the coachman and the #carriage# drove rapidly on $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was tired and sleepy he therefore went to #bed# placing his pocketbook under his pillow
$peppino$ had a little spare #time# so he had a game of morra with the facchini lost three crowns and then to console himself drank a bottle of orvieto
the next #morning# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ awoke late though he went to #bed# so early he had not slept well for five or six #night# even if he had slept at all
he breakfasted heartily and caring little as he said for the beauties of the eternal city ordered post #horse# at noon but $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had not reckoned upon the formalities of the #police# and the idleness of the posting #master#
all these preparations had collected a number of idlers round the #door# of $signor_pastrini$ the descendants of marius and the gracchi were also not wanting
the #horse# only arrived at two clock and the cicerone did not bring the passport till three the #baron# walked triumphantly through the crowd who for the sake of gain styled him your #excellency#
as $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had hitherto contented himself with being called a #baron# he felt rather flattered at the title of #excellency# and distributed a dozen silver coins among the beggars who were ready for twelve more to call him your highness
which #road# asked the postilion in italian the ancona #road# replied the #baron# $signor_pastrini$ interpreted the #question# and #answer# and the #horse# galloped off
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ intended travelling to venice where he would receive #one# #part# of his #fortune# and then proceeding to vienna where he would find the #rest# he meant to take up his residence in the latter town which he had been told was a city of #pleasure#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had not intended starting so late or he would have remained he put his #head# out and asked the postilion how long it would be before they reached the next town
he had scarcely advanced three leagues out of rome when daylight began to disappear non capisco do not understand was the reply
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ bent his #head# which he meant to imply very well the #carriage# again moved on i #will# stop at the first posting $house_of_peers$ said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ to himself
he still felt the same self satisfaction which he had experienced the previous #evening# and which had procured him so good a #night# #rest#
he was luxuriously stretched in a good english calash with double springs he was drawn by four good #horse# at full gallop he knew the relay to be at a #distance# of seven leagues
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #thought# for ten #minute# about his #wife# in paris another ten #minute# about his #daughter# travelling with $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ armilly the same period was given to his creditors and the #manner# in which he intended spending their #money# and then having no #subject# left for contemplation he shut his #eye# and fell asleep
now and then a jolt more violent than the #rest# caused him to open his #eye# then he felt that he was still being carried with great rapidity over the same #country# thickly strewn with broken aqueducts which looked like granite giants petrified while running a race
but the #night# was cold dull and rainy and it was much more pleasant for a #traveller# to remain in the warm #carriage# than to put his #head# out of the #window# to make inquiries of a postilion whose only #answer# was non capisco
what #subject# of meditation could present itself to the #banker# so fortunately become bankrupt $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ therefore continued to sleep saying to himself that he would be sure to awake at the posting $house_of_peers$
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ fancied that they had reached the long desired #point# he opened his #eye# and looked through the #window# expecting to find himself in the midst of some town or at least village but he saw #nothing# except what seemed like a ruin where three or four #man# went and came like #shadow#
the #carriage# stopped $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ waited a #moment# expecting the postilion to come and demand payment with the termination of his stage
he intended taking advantage of the opportunity to make fresh inquiries of the new conductor but the #horse# were unharnessed and #other# put in their #place# without #anyone# claiming #money# from the #traveller#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ astonished opened the #door# but a strong #hand# pushed him back and the #carriage# rolled on the #baron# was completely roused
eh he said to the postilion eh mio caro this was another little #piece# of italian the #baron# had learned from hearing his #daughter# sing italian duets with $monsieur_cavalcanti$
but mio caro did not reply $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ then opened the #window# come my #friend# he said thrusting his #hand# through the #opening#
where are we going dentro la testa answered a solemn and imperious #voice# accompanied by a menacing gesture
he obeyed not without some uneasiness which momentarily increasing caused his #mind# instead of being as unoccupied as it was when he began his journey to fill with #idea# which were very likely to keep a #traveller# awake more especially #one# in such a situation as $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
his #eye# acquired that quality which in the first #moment# of strong #emotion# enables them to see distinctly and which afterwards fails from being too much taxed
before we are alarmed we see correctly when we are alarmed we see double and when we have been alarmed we see #nothing# but trouble
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #thought# dentro la testa meant put in your #head# he was making rapid progress in italian $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ observed a #man# in a cloak galloping at the #right# #hand# of the #carriage#
some gendarme he exclaimed can i have been intercepted by french telegrams to the pontifical authorities he resolved to #end# his anxiety
where are you taking me he asked dentro la testa replied the same #voice# with the same menacing accent
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ turned to the left another #man# on horseback was galloping on that #side# decidedly said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ with the perspiration on his #forehead#
i must be under arrest and he threw himself back in the calash not this #time# to sleep but to think
he then saw the great aqueducts those #stone# phantoms which he had before remarked only then they were on the #right# #hand# now they were on the left
directly afterwards the moon rose he understood that they had described a circle and were bringing him back to rome
oh unfortunate he cried they must have obtained my arrest the #carriage# continued to roll on with frightful speed
at #length# he saw a dark mass against which it seemed as if the #carriage# was about to dash but the vehicle turned to #one# #side# leaving the barrier behind and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ saw that it was #one# of the ramparts encircling rome
mon dieu cried $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ we are not returning to rome then it is not #justice# which is pursuing me
an #hour# of #terror# elapsed for every #spot# they passed showed that they were on the #road# back gracious heavens another #idea# presents itself
he remembered those interesting #story# so little believed in paris respecting roman #bandit# he remembered the adventures that $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had related when it was intended that he should marry $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
what if they should be his #hair# stood on #end# they are robbers perhaps he muttered just then the #carriage# rolled on #something# harder than gravel #road#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ hazarded a #look# on both #side# of the #road# and perceived monuments of a singular form and his #mind# now recalled all the details $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had related and comparing them with his own situation he felt sure that he must be on the appian #way#
on the left in a #sort# of valley he perceived a circular excavation it was caracalla circus on a #word# from the #man# who rode at the #side# of the #carriage# it stopped
at the same #time# the #door# was opened scendi exclaimed a commanding #voice# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ instantly descended although he did not yet speak italian he understood it very well
more dead than alive he looked around him four #man# surrounded him besides the postilion di quà said #one# of the #man# descending a little path leading out of the appian #way#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ followed his guide without opposition and had no occasion to #turn# around to see whether the three #other# were following him
after walking for about ten #minute# during which $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ did not exchange a single #word# with his guide he found himself between a hillock and a clump of high weeds three #man# standing silent formed a triangle of which he was the centre
still it appeared as though they were stationed at equal #distance# from #one# another like sentinels he wished to speak but his tongue refused to move
this #time# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ had double #reason# to understand for if the #word# and gesture had not explained the speaker meaning it was clearly expressed by the #man# walking behind him who pushed him so rudely that he struck against the guide
this guide was our #friend# $peppino$ who dashed into the thicket of high weeds through a path which none but lizards or polecats could have imagined to be an open #road#
$peppino$ stopped before a #rock# overhung by thick hedges the #rock# #half# open afforded a passage to the young #man# who disappeared like the evil spirits in the fairy tales
avanti said the same sharp and imperative #voice# the #voice# and gesture of the #man# who followed $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ ordered him to do the same
there was no longer any #doubt# the bankrupt was in the #hand# of roman banditti $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ acquitted himself like a #man# placed between two dangerous #position# and who is rendered brave by #fear#
notwithstanding his large stomach certainly not intended to penetrate the fissures of the campagna he slid down like $peppino$ and closing his #eye# fell upon his #foot#
$peppino$ who cared little for being recognized now that he was in his own territories struck a #light# and lit a torch
two #other# #man# descended after $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ forming the rearguard and pushing $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ whenever he happened to stop they came by a gentle declivity to the intersection of two corridors
the #wall# were hollowed out in sepulchres #one# above the #other# and which seemed in contrast with the white #stone# to open their large dark #eye# like those which we see on the #face# of the dead
as he touched the #ground# he opened his #eye# the path was wide but dark a sentinel struck the rings of his carbine against his left #hand#
there said the sentinel pointing over his #shoulder# to a spacious crypt hollowed out of the #rock# the #light# from which shone into the passage through the large arched #opening#
who comes there he cried a #friend# a #friend# said $peppino$ but where is the #captain#
said $peppino$ in italian and taking $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ by the collar of his coat he dragged him to an #opening# resembling a #door# through which they entered the #apartment# which the #captain# appeared to have made his dwelling #place#
fine spoil #captain# fine spoil is this the #man# asked the #captain# who was attentively reading plutarch #life# of alexander
at this rather impertinent #order# $peppino$ raised his torch to the #face# of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who hastily withdrew that he might not have his eyelashes burnt
himself #captain# himself very well show him to me his agitated #feature# presented the #appearance# of pale and hideous #terror#
oh murmured $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ that #bed# is probably #one# of the coffins hollowed in the #wall# and the sleep i shall enjoy #will# be #death# from #one# of the poniards i see glistening in the #darkness#
from their #bed# of dried leaves or wolf skins at the back of the #chamber# now arose the #companion# of the #man# who had been found by $m_albert_de_morcerf$ reading $cæsar_borgia$ commentaries and by $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ studying the #life# of alexander
the #man# is tired said the #captain# conduct him to his #bed# the #banker# uttered a groan and followed his guide he neither supplicated nor exclaimed
at #length# he found himself at the #foot# of a #staircase# and he mechanically lifted his #foot# five or six #time#
then a low #door# was opened before him and bending his #head# to avoid striking his #forehead# he entered a small #room# cut out of the #rock#
he no longer possessed #strength# #will# #power# or #feeling# he followed where they led him the cell was clean though empty and dry though situated at an immeasurable #distance# under the #earth#
a #bed# of dried grass covered with goat skins was placed in #one# #corner# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ brightened up on beholding it fancying that it gave some #promise# of safety
oh god be praised he said it is a real #bed# this was the second #time# within the #hour# that he had invoked the #name# of god
he had not done so for ten #year# before ecco said the guide and pushing $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ into the cell he closed the #door# upon him
if there had been no bolt it would have been impossible for him to pass through the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of st sebastian encamped round a #master# whom our readers must have recognized as the famous $luigi_vampa$
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ too had recognized the #bandit# whose existence he would not believe when $m_albert_de_morcerf$ mentioned him in paris and not only did he recognize him but the cell in which $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had been confined and which was probably kept for the accommodation of #stranger#
a bolt grated and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was a #prisoner# these recollections were dwelt upon with some #pleasure# by $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ and restored him to some degree of tranquillity
they had arrested him for the #purpose# of robbery and as he had only a few $louis_xviii$ about him he doubted not he would be ransomed
he remembered that $m_albert_de_morcerf$ had been taxed at crowns and as he considered himself of much greater importance than $m_albert_de_morcerf$ he fixed his own price at crowns
since the #bandit# had not despatched him at once he felt that they would not kill him at all eight thousand crowns amounted to livres he would then have about #franc# left
therefore tolerably secure in being able to extricate himself from his #position# provided he were not rated at the unreasonable #sum# of #franc# he stretched himself on his #bed# and after turning over two or three #time# fell asleep with the tranquillity of the hero whose #life# $luigi_vampa$ was studying
with this #sum# he could manage to keep out of difficulties #chapter# $luigi_vampa$ bill of fare we awake from every sleep except the #one# dreaded by $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
to a parisian accustomed to silken curtains #wall# hung with velvet drapery and the soft perfume of burning wood the white smoke of which diffuses itself in graceful curves around the #room# the #appearance# of the whitewashed cell which greeted his #eye# on awakening seemed like the continuation of some disagreeable #dream#
he awoke but in such a situation a single #moment# suffices to change the strongest #doubt# into certainty yes yes he murmured
i am in the #hand# of the brigands of whom $m_albert_de_morcerf$ spoke his first #idea# was to breathe that he might know whether he was wounded
he borrowed this from don quixote the only book he had ever read but which he still slightly remembered
no he cried they have not wounded but perhaps they have robbed me and he thrust his #hand# into his #pocket#
they were untouched the hundred $louis_xviii$ he had reserved for his journey from rome to venice were in his trousers #pocket# and in that of his greatcoat he found the little #note# #case# containing his #letter# of credit for #franc#
singular #bandit# he exclaimed they have left me my purse and #pocket# book as i was saying last #night# they intend me to be ransomed
hello here is my watch let me see what #time# it is $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ watch #one# of breguet repeaters which he had carefully wound up on the previous #night# struck #half# past five
without this $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ would have been quite ignorant of the #time# for daylight did not reach his cell should he demand an explanation from the #bandit# or should he wait patiently for them to propose it
the last alternative seemed the most prudent so he waited until twelve clock during all this #time# a sentinel who had been relieved at eight clock had been watching his #door#
he had noticed that a few rays not of daylight but from a lamp penetrated through the ill joined planks of the #door# he approached just as the brigand was refreshing himself with a mouthful of brandy which owing to the leathern bottle containing it sent forth an odor which was extremely unpleasant to $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ suddenly felt a strong inclination to see the #person# who kept watch over him faugh he exclaimed retreating to the farther #corner# of his cell
at twelve this #man# was replaced by another functionary and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ wishing to catch #sight# of his new guardian approached the #door# again
he was an athletic gigantic #bandit# with large #eye# thick #lip# and a flat nose his red #hair# fell in dishevelled masses like snakes around his #shoulder#
this #fellow# is more like an ogre than #anything# else however i am rather too old and tough to be very good eating
we see that $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was collected enough to jest at the same #time# as though to disprove the ogreish propensities the #man# took some black bread cheese and onions from his wallet which he began devouring voraciously
may i be hanged said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ glancing at the #bandit# #dinner# through the crevices of the #door# may i be hanged if i can understand how #people# can eat such filth and he withdrew to #seat# himself upon his goat skin which reminded him of the smell of the brandy
but the mysteries of #nature# are incomprehensible and there are certain invitations contained in even the coarsest food which appeal very irresistibly to a fasting stomach
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ felt his own not to be very well supplied just then and gradually the #man# appeared less ugly the bread less black and the cheese more fresh while those dreadful vulgar onions recalled to his #mind# certain sauces and #side# dishes which his cook prepared in a very superior #manner# whenever he said $monsieur_cavalcanti$ deniseau let me have a nice little fricassee #today#
ah ha cried $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ he got up and knocked on the #door# the #bandit# raised his #head#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ knew that he was heard so he redoubled his blows che cosa asked the #bandit# come come said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ tapping his #finger# against the #door#
but whether he did not understand him or whether he had received no #order# respecting the nourishment of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ the giant without answering went on with his #dinner#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #feeling# were hurt and not wishing to put himself under obligations to the brute the #banker# threw himself down again on his goat skin and did not breathe another #word#
i think it is quite #time# to think of giving me #something# to eat four #hour# passed by and the giant was replaced by another #bandit#
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who really began to experience sundry gnawings at the stomach arose softly again applied his #eye# to the crack of the #door# and recognized the intelligent #countenance# of his guide
it was indeed $peppino$ who was preparing to mount guard as comfortably as possible by seating himself opposite to the #door# and placing between his legs an earthen pan containing chick peas stewed with bacon
near the pan he also placed a pretty little basket of villetri grapes and a flask of orvieto $peppino$ was decidedly an epicure
come he said to himself let me try if he #will# be more tractable than the #other# and he tapped gently at the #door#
on va coming exclaimed $peppino$ who from frequenting the $house_of_peers$ of $signor_pastrini$ understood french perfectly in all its idioms
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ watched these preparations and his mouth watered $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ immediately recognized him as the #man# who had called out in such a furious #manner#
but this was not the #time# for recrimination so he assumed his most agreeable #manner# and said with a gracious #smile#
put in your #head# excuse me #sir# but are they not going to give me any #dinner# does your #excellency# happen to be hungry
happen to be hungry that pretty good when i havent eaten for twenty four #hour# muttered $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ then he added aloud
yes #sir# i am hungry very hungry and your #excellency# wants #something# to eat at once if possible
#nothing# easier said $peppino$ here you can get #anything# you want by paying for it of #course# as among honest folk
of #course# cried $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ although in #justice# the #people# who arrest and imprison you ought at least to feed you
that is not the custom #excellency# said $peppino$ a bad #reason# replied $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ who reckoned on conciliating his keeper
but i am content let me have some #dinner# at once what would your #excellency# like and $peppino$ placed his pan on the #ground# so that the steam rose directly under the nostrils of $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
give your #order# have you kitchens here kitchens of #course# complete #one# and cooks excellent well a fowl fish
game it signifies little so that i eat as your #excellency# pleases you mentioned a fowl i think
his #voice# yet echoed in the archway when a handsome graceful and #half# naked young #man# appeared bearing a fowl in a silver dish on his #head# without the assistance of his #hand#
yes a fowl $peppino$ turning around shouted a fowl for his #excellency# i could almost believe myself at the café de paris murmured $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
here your #excellency# said $peppino$ taking the fowl from the young #bandit# and placing it on the worm eaten #table# which with the stool and the goat skin #bed# formed the entire furniture of the cell
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ asked for a knife and fork here #excellency# said $peppino$ offering him a little blunt knife and a boxwood fork
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ took the knife in #one# #hand# and the fork in the #other# and was about to cut up the fowl
pardon me #excellency# said $peppino$ placing his #hand# on the #banker# #shoulder# #people# pay here before they eat they might not be satisfied and
ah ha #thought# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ this is not so much like paris except that i shall probably be skinned never #mind# i ll fix that all #right#
i have always heard how cheap poultry is in italy i should think a fowl is worth about twelve sous at rome there he said throwing a $louis_xviii$ down
$peppino$ picked up the $louis_xviii$ and $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ again prepared to carve the fowl stay a #moment# your #excellency# said $peppino$ rising you still owe me #something#
i said they would skin me #thought# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ but resolving to resist the extortion he said come how much do i owe you for this fowl
your #excellency# has given me a $louis_xviii$ on #account# a $louis_xviii$ on #account# for a fowl
certainly and your #excellency# now owes me $louis_xviii$ $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ opened his enormous #eye# on hearing this gigantic joke
very droll he muttered very droll indeed and he again began to carve the fowl when $peppino$ stopped the #baron# #right# #hand# with his left and held out his #other# #hand#
come now he said is it not a joke said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ we never joke replied $peppino$ solemn as a quaker
what a hundred thousand #franc# for a fowl ah #excellency# you cannot imagine how hard it is to rear fowls in these horrible caves
come come this is very droll very amusing i allow but as i am very hungry pray allow me to eat
stay here is another $louis_xviii$ for you then that #will# make only $louis_xviii$ more said $peppino$ with the same indifference
oh as for that said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ angry at this prolongation of the jest as for that you wont get them at all
i shall get them all in #time# go to the devil you do not know with whom you have to deal
$peppino$ made a #sign# and the youth hastily removed the fowl $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ threw himself upon his goat skin and $peppino$ reclosing the #door# again began eating his peas and bacon
though $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ could not see $peppino$ the #noise# of his teeth allowed no #doubt# as to his occupation he was certainly eating and noisily too like an ill bred #man#
brute said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $peppino$ pretended not to hear him and without even turning his #head# continued to eat slowly
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ stomach felt so empty that it seemed as if it would be impossible ever to fill it again still he had patience for another #half# #hour# which appeared to him like a century
he again arose and went to the #door# come #sir# do not keep me starving here any longer but tell me what they want
nay your #excellency# it is you who should tell us what you want give your #order# and we #will# execute them
then open the #door# directly $peppino$ obeyed now #look# here i want #something# to eat to eat do you hear
are you hungry come you understand me what would your #excellency# like to eat a #piece# of dry bread since the fowls are beyond all price in this accursed #place#
bread very well holloa there some bread he called the youth brought a small loaf how much asked $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
four thousand nine hundred and ninety eight $louis_xviii$ said $peppino$ you have paid two $louis_xviii$ in advance
what #one# hundred thousand #franc# for a loaf #one# hundred thousand #franc# repeated $peppino$ but you only asked #franc# for a fowl
we have a fixed price for all our provisions it signifies #nothing# whether you eat much or little whether you have ten dishes or #one#
it is always the same price what still keeping up this silly jest my dear #fellow# it is perfectly ridiculous stupid
you had better tell me at once that you intend starving me to #death# oh dear no your #excellency# unless you intend to commit suicide
pay and eat and what am i to pay with brute said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ enraged do you suppose i carry #franc# in my #pocket#
your #excellency# has #franc# in your #pocket# that #will# be fifty fowls at #franc# apiece and #half# a fowl for the
the bandage fell from his #eye# and he understood the joke which he did not think quite so stupid as he had done just before
come he said if i pay you the #franc# #will# you be satisfied and allow me to eat at my ease
oh #nothing# easier you have an #account# open with messrs $thomson_french_of_rome$ via dei banchi rome give me a draft for $louis_xviii$ on these #gentleman# and our #banker# shall take it
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ shuddered certainly said $peppino$ but how can i pay them $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #thought# it as well to comply with a good grace so he took the pen ink and
#paper# $peppino$ offered him wrote the draft and signed it here he said here is a draft at #sight#
and here is your fowl $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ sighed while he carved the fowl it appeared very thin for the price it had cost
as for $peppino$ he examined the #paper# attentively put it into his #pocket# and continued eating his peas #chapter# the pardon
the #prisoner# expected that he would be at no expense that #day# for like an economical #man# he had concealed #half# of his fowl and a #piece# of the bread in the #corner# of his cell
the next #day# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was again hungry certainly the #air# of that dungeon was very provocative of appetite but he had no sooner eaten than he felt thirsty he had forgotten that
he struggled against his thirst till his tongue clave to the roof of his mouth then no longer able to resist he called out
the sentinel opened the #door# it was a new #face# he #thought# it would be better to transact #business# with his old acquaintance so he sent for $peppino$
here i am your #excellency# said $peppino$ with an eagerness which $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #thought# favorable to him what do you want
#something# to drink your #excellency# knows that wine is beyond all price near rome then give me #water# cried $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ endeavoring to parry the blow
oh #water# is even more scarce than wine your #excellency# there has been such a drought come #thought# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
and while he smiled as he attempted to regard the #affair# as a joke he felt his temples get moist with perspiration
come my #friend# said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ seeing that he made no impression on $peppino$ you #will# not refuse me a #glass# of wine
it is the same old #story# i have already told you that we do not sell at retail
well then let me have a bottle of the least expensive they are all the same price
tell me cried $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ in a #tone# whose bitterness harpagon alone has been capable of revealing tell me that you #wish# to despoil me of all it #will# be sooner over than devouring me piecemeal
and what is that twenty five thousand #franc# a bottle it is possible such may be
the #master# intention the #master# who is he the #person# to whom you were conducted #yesterday# where is he
here let me see him certainly and the next #moment# $luigi_vampa$ appeared before $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
you sent for me he said to the #prisoner# are you #sir# the chief of the #people# who brought me here
yes your #excellency# what then how much do you require for my ransom merely the you have about you
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ felt a dreadful spasm dart through his #heart# but this is all i have left in the #world# he said out of an immense #fortune#
if you deprive me of that take away my #life# also we are forbidden to shed your #blood#
and by whom are you forbidden by him we obey you do then obey someone
yes a chief i #thought# you said you were the chief so i am of these #man# but there is another over me
and did your superior #order# you to treat me in this #way# yes but my purse #will# be exhausted
probably come said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #will# you take a #million# no two #million# three four come four i #will# give them to you on condition that you let me go
why do you offer me for what is worth this is a kind of usury #banker# that i do not understand
take all then take all i tell you and kill me come come calm yourself you #will# excite your #blood# and that would produce an appetite it would require a #million# a #day# to satisfy
be more economical but when i have no more #money# left to pay you asked the infuriated $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$
then you must suffer hunger suffer hunger said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ becoming pale most likely replied $luigi_vampa$ coolly but you say you do not #wish# to kill me
no and yet you #will# let me perish with hunger ah that is a different #thing#
well then wretches cried $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ i #will# defy your infamous calculations i would rather die at once you may torture torment kill me but you shall not have my signature again
as your #excellency# pleases said $luigi_vampa$ as he left the cell $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ raving threw himself on the goat skin who could these #man# be
who was the invisible chief what could be his intentions towards him and why when #everyone# else was allowed to be ransomed might he not also be
oh yes certainly a speedy violent #death# would be a fine #mean# of deceiving these remorseless #enemy# who appeared to pursue him with such incomprehensible vengeance
for the first #time# in his #life# $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ contemplated #death# with a mixture of dread and #desire# the #time# had come when the implacable spectre which exists in the #mind# of every human creature arrested his #attention# and called out with every pulsation of his #heart# thou shalt die
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ resembled a timid animal excited in the chase first it flies then despairs and at last by the very force of desperation sometimes succeeds in eluding its pursuers
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ meditated an escape but the #wall# were solid #rock# a #man# was sitting reading at the only outlet to the cell and behind that #man# shapes armed with guns continually passed
but to die his resolution not to #sign# lasted two #day# after which he offered a #million# for some food they sent him a magnificent supper and took his #million#
at the #end# of twelve #day# after having made a splendid #dinner# he reckoned his #account# and found that he had only #franc# left
then a strange reaction took #place# he who had just abandoned endeavored to save the #franc# he had left and sooner than give them up he resolved to enter again upon a #life# of privation he was deluded by the hopefulness that is a premonition of madness
he who for so long a #time# had forgotten god began to think that miracles were possible that the accursed cavern might be discovered by the #officer# of the papal states who would release him that then he would have remaining which would be sufficient to save him from starvation and finally he prayed that this #sum# might be preserved to him and as he prayed he wept
from this #time# the #prisoner# resolved to suffer no longer but to have #everything# he wanted three #day# passed thus during which his prayers were frequent if not heartfelt
sometimes he was delirious and fancied he saw an old #man# stretched on a pallet he also was dying of hunger
he had picked up every crumb that had been left from his former meals and was beginning to eat the matting which covered the #floor# of his cell
then he entreated $peppino$ as he would a guardian angel to give him food he offered him #franc# for a mouthful of bread
on the fourth he was no longer a #man# but a living corpse but $peppino$ did not #answer# on the fifth #day# he dragged himself to the #door# of the cell
are you not a christian he said falling on his knees do you #wish# to assassinate a #man# who in the #eye# of heaven is a #brother#
oh my former #friend# my former #friend# he murmured and fell with his #face# to the #ground# then rising in #despair# he exclaimed
the chief the chief here i am said $luigi_vampa$ instantly appearing what do you want take my last #gold# muttered $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ holding out his #pocket# book and let me live here
i ask no more for #liberty# i only ask to live then you suffer a great deal oh yes yes cruelly
still there have been #man# who suffered more than you i do not think so yes those who have died of hunger
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #thought# of the old #man# whom in his #hour# of delirium he had seen groaning on his #bed# he struck his #forehead# on the #ground# and groaned
yes he said there have been some who have suffered more than i have but then they must have been martyrs at least
his feeble #eye# endeavored to distinguish objects and behind the #bandit# he saw a #man# enveloped in a cloak #half# lost in the #shadow# of a #stone# column
do you repent asked a deep solemn #voice# which caused $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ #hair# to stand on #end#
of what must i repent stammered $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ of the evil you have done said the #voice# oh yes oh yes i do indeed repent
and he struck his breast with his emaciated fist then i forgive you said the #man# dropping his cloak and advancing to the #light#
the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ said $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ more pale from #terror# than he had been just before from hunger and misery
you are mistaken i am not the #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ then who are you m
i am he whom you sold and dishonored i am he whose betrothed you prostituted i am he upon whom you trampled that you might raise yourself to #fortune#
i am he whose #father# you condemned to die of hunger i am he whom you also condemned to starvation and who yet forgives you because he #hope# to be forgiven
i am $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ uttered a #cry# and fell prostrate rise said the #count# your #life# is safe the same good #fortune# has not happened to your accomplices
#one# is mad the #other# dead keep the #franc# you have left i give them to you the you stole from the hospitals has been restored to them by an unknown #hand#
and now eat and drink i #will# entertain you tonight $luigi_vampa$ when this #man# is satisfied let him be free
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ remained prostrate while the #count# withdrew when he raised his #head# he saw disappearing down the passage #nothing# but a #shadow# before which the #bandit# bowed
according to the #count# directions $mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ was waited on by $luigi_vampa$ who brought him the best wine and fruits of italy then having conducted him to the #road# and pointed to the post chaise left him leaning against a #tree#
he remained there all #night# not knowing where he was when daylight dawned he saw that he was near a stream he was thirsty and dragged himself towards it
as he stooped down to drink he saw that his #hair# had become entirely white #chapter# the fifth of october
it was about six clock in the #evening# an opal colored #light# through which an autumnal sun shed its golden rays descended on the blue ocean
the heat of the #day# had gradually decreased and a #light# breeze arose seeming like the respiration of #nature# on awakening from the burning siesta of the south
a delicious zephyr played along the coasts of the mediterranean and wafted from shore to shore the sweet perfume of plants mingled with the fresh smell of the #sea#
a #light# yacht chaste and elegant in its form was gliding amidst the first dews of #night# over the immense lake extending from gibraltar to the dardanelles and from tunis to venice
the #vessel# resembled a swan with its wings opened towards the wind gliding on the #water# it advanced swiftly and gracefully leaving behind it a glittering stretch of foam
by degrees the sun disappeared behind the western horizon but as though to prove the #truth# of the fanciful #idea# in heathen mythology its indiscreet rays reappeared on the summit of every wave as if the god of #fire# had just sunk upon the bosom of amphitrite who in vain endeavored to hide her lover beneath her azure mantle
the yacht moved rapidly on though there did not appear to be sufficient wind to ruffle the curls on the #head# of a young #girl#
standing on the prow was a tall #man# of a dark complexion who saw with dilating #eye# that they were approaching a dark mass of land in the shape of a cone which rose from the midst of the waves like the hat of a catalan
is that $m_de_monte_cristo$ asked the #traveller# to whose #order# the yacht was for the #time# submitted in a melancholy #voice#
yes your #excellency# said the #captain# we have reached it we have reached it repeated the #traveller# in an accent of indescribable sadness
and then he again plunged into a train of #thought# the character of which was better revealed by a sad #smile# than it would have been by #tear#
a few #minute# afterwards a flash of #light# which was extinguished instantly was seen on the land and the #sound# of firearms reached the yacht
then he added in a low #tone# yes that is the haven your #excellency# said the #captain# that was the land signal #will# you #answer# yourself
what signal the #captain# pointed towards the #island# up the #side# of which ascended a volume of smoke increasing as it rose
ah yes he said as if awaking from a #dream# give it to me the #captain# gave him a loaded carbine the #traveller# slowly raised it and fired in the #air#
ten #minute# afterwards the sails were furled and they cast anchor about a hundred fathoms from the little harbor the gig was already lowered and in it were four oarsmen and a coxswain
the #traveller# descended and instead of sitting down at the stern of the #boat# which had been decorated with a blue carpet for his accommodation stood up with his #arm# crossed
the rowers waited their oars #half# lifted out of the #water# like birds drying their wings give #way# said the #traveller#
the eight oars fell into the #sea# simultaneously without splashing a drop of #water# and the #boat# yielding to the impulsion glided forward
in an #instant# they found themselves in a little harbor formed in a natural creek the #boat# grounded on the fine sand
#will# your #excellency# be so good as to mount the #shoulder# of two of our #man# they #will# carry you ashore
the young #man# answered this invitation with a gesture of indifference and stepped out of the #boat# the #sea# immediately rose to his waist
ah your #excellency# murmured the pilot you should not have done so our #master# #will# scold us for it
thirty strides brought them to dry land the young #man# stamped on the #ground# to shake off the wet and looked around for someone to show him his #road# for it was quite dark
the young #man# continued to advance following the #sailor# who chose a firm footing just as he turned a #hand# rested on his #shoulder# and a #voice# which made him shudder exclaimed
ah is it you #count# said the young #man# in an almost joyful accent pressing $m_de_monte_cristo$ #hand# with both his own
good #evening# $m_maximilian_morrel$ you are punctual #thank# you yes you see i am as exact as you are but you are dripping my dear #fellow# you must change your clothes as calypso said to telemachus
$m_de_monte_cristo$ perceived that the young #man# had turned around indeed $m_maximilian_morrel$ saw with surprise that the #man# who had brought him had left without being paid or uttering a #word#
come i have a habitation prepared for you in which you #will# soon forget fatigue and cold already the #sound# of their oars might be heard as they returned to the yacht
oh yes said the #count# you are looking for the #sailor# yes i paid them #nothing# and yet they are gone
never #mind# that $m_maximilian_morrel$ said $m_de_monte_cristo$ smiling i have made an agreement with the navy that the access to my #island# shall be free of all charge
i have made a bargain $m_maximilian_morrel$ looked at the #count# with surprise #count# he said you are not the same here as in paris
how so here you laugh the #count# #brow# became clouded you are #right# to recall me to myself $m_maximilian_morrel$ he said
i was delighted to see you again and forgot for the #moment# that all #happiness# is fleeting oh no no #count#
cried $m_maximilian_morrel$ seizing the #count# #hand# pray laugh be happy and prove to me by your indifference that #life# is endurable to sufferers
oh how charitable kind and good you are you affect this gayety to inspire me with courage you are wrong $m_maximilian_morrel$ i was really happy
then you forget me so much the better how so yes for as the gladiator said to the emperor when he entered the arena
he who is about to die salutes you then you are not consoled asked the #count# surprised
oh exclaimed $m_maximilian_morrel$ with a #glance# full of bitter reproach do you think it possible that i could be listen said the #count#
do you understand the meaning of my #word# you cannot take me for a commonplace #man# a mere rattle emitting a vague and senseless #noise#
when i ask you if you are consoled i speak to you as a #man# for whom the human #heart# has no #secret#
well $m_maximilian_morrel$ let us both examine the depths of your #heart# do you still feel the same feverish impatience of #grief# which made you start like a wounded lion
are you still actuated by the regret which drags the living to the pursuit of #death# or are you only suffering from the prostration of fatigue and the weariness of #hope# deferred
have you still that devouring thirst which can only be appeased in the grave has the loss of memory rendered it impossible for you to weep
oh my dear #friend# if this be the #case# if you can no longer weep if your frozen #heart# be dead if you put all your trust in god then $m_maximilian_morrel$ you are consoled do not complain
#count# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ in a firm and at the same #time# soft #voice# listen to me as to a #man# whose #thought# are raised to heaven though he remains on #earth# i come to die in the #arm# of a #friend#
i #love# my sister $mademoiselle_julie$ i #love# her #husband# $m_emmanuel$ but i require a strong #mind# to #smile# on my last #moment#
certainly there are #people# whom i #love# my sister would be bathed in #tear# and fainting i could not bear to see her suffer
you #count# who are more than mortal #will# i am sure lead me to #death# by a pleasant path #will# you not
$m_emmanuel$ would #tear# the weapon from my #hand# and alarm the $house_of_peers$ with his #cry# my #friend# said the #count#
i have still #one# #doubt# are you weak enough to pride yourself upon your sufferings no indeed i am calm said $m_maximilian_morrel$ giving his #hand# to the #count#
my pulse does not beat slower or faster than usual no i feel that i have reached the goal and i #will# go no farther
you told me to wait and #hope# do you know what you did unfortunate adviser i waited a #month# or rather i suffered for a #month#
what i cannot tell #something# wonderful an absurdity a miracle of what #nature# he alone can tell who has mingled with our #reason# that folly we call #hope#
yes i did #hope# #count# and during this #quarter# of an #hour# we have been talking together you have unconsciously wounded tortured my #heart# for every #word# you have uttered proved that there was no #hope# for me
i did #hope# #man# is a poor wretched creature i did #hope# yes i did wait oh #count# i shall sleep calmly deliciously in the #arm# of #death#
my #friend# continued $m_maximilian_morrel$ you named the fifth of october as the #end# of the period of waiting #today# is the fifth of october he took out his watch
$m_maximilian_morrel$ uttered these #word# with an energy which made the #count# shudder it is now nine clock i have yet three #hour# to live
be it so said the #count# come $m_maximilian_morrel$ mechanically followed the #count# and they had entered the grotto before he perceived it
he felt a carpet under his #foot# a #door# opened perfumes surrounded him and a brilliant #light# dazzled his #eye# $m_maximilian_morrel$ hesitated to advance he dreaded the enervating #effect# of all that he saw
why should we not spend the last three #hour# remaining to us of #life# like those ancient romans who when condemned by nero their emperor and heir sat down at a #table# covered with flowers and gently glided into #death# amid the perfume of heliotropes and roses
$m_de_monte_cristo$ drew him in gently $m_maximilian_morrel$ smiled as you please he said #death# is always #death# that is forgetfulness repose exclusion from #life# and therefore from #grief#
they were in the marvellous dining #room# before described where the statues had baskets on their #head# always filled with fruits and flowers
he sat down and $m_de_monte_cristo$ placed himself opposite to him $m_maximilian_morrel$ had looked carelessly around and had probably noticed #nothing#
you are the epitome of all human knowledge and you seem like a being descended from a wiser and more advanced #world# than ours
let us talk like #man# he said looking at the #count# go on #count# said $m_maximilian_morrel$
there is #something# true in what you say said the #count# with that #smile# which made him so handsome i have descended from a planet called #grief#
i believe all you tell me without questioning its meaning for instance you told me to live and i did live you told me to #hope# and i almost did so
i am almost inclined to ask you as though you had experienced #death# is it painful to die
$m_de_monte_cristo$ looked upon $m_maximilian_morrel$ with indescribable tenderness yes he said yes doubtless it is painful if you violently break the outer covering which obstinately begs for #life#
if you plunge a dagger into your flesh if you insinuate a bullet into your brain which the least shock disorders then certainly you #will# suffer pain and you #will# repent quitting a #life# for a repose you have bought at so dear a price
i know that there is a #secret# of luxury and pain in #death# as well as in #life# the only #thing# is to understand it
you have spoken truly $m_maximilian_morrel$ according to the #care# we bestow upon it #death# is either a #friend# who #rock# us gently as a nurse or an #enemy# who violently drags the soul from the #body#
some #day# when the #world# is much older and when mankind #will# be #master# of all the destructive #power# in #nature# to serve for the general good of humanity when mankind as you were just saying have discovered the #secret# of #death# then that #death# #will# become as sweet and voluptuous as a slumber in the #arm# of your beloved
yes and if you wished to die you would choose this #death# #count# yes
now i understand he said why you had me brought here to this desolate #spot# in the midst of the ocean to this subterranean palace it was because you loved me was it not #count#
it was because you loved me well enough to give me #one# of those sweet #mean# of #death# of which we were speaking a #death# without agony a #death# which allows me to fade away while pronouncing $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #name# and pressing your #hand#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ extended his #hand# yes you have guessed rightly $m_maximilian_morrel$ said the #count# that is what i intended
#thank# the #idea# that #tomorrow# i shall no longer suffer is sweet to my #heart# do you then regret #nothing#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ clear #eye# was for the #moment# clouded then it shone with unusual lustre and a large #tear# rolled down his cheek
no replied $m_maximilian_morrel$ not even me asked the #count# with deep #emotion# what said the #count# do you still regret #anything# in the #world# and yet die
oh i entreat you exclaimed $m_maximilian_morrel$ in a low #voice# do not speak another #word# #count# do not prolong my punishment
the #count# fancied that he was yielding and this belief revived the horrible #doubt# that had overwhelmed him at the château if
i am endeavoring he #thought# to make this #man# happy i #look# upon this restitution as a weight thrown into the scale to balance the evil i have wrought
now supposing i am deceived supposing this #man# has not been unhappy enough to merit #happiness# alas what would become of me who can only atone for evil by doing good
then he said aloud listen $m_maximilian_morrel$ i see your #grief# is great but still you do not like to risk your soul
$m_maximilian_morrel$ smiled sadly #count# he said i swear to you my soul is no longer my own $m_maximilian_morrel$ you know i have no relation in the #world#
i have accustomed myself to regard you as my #son# well then to save my #son# i #will# sacrifice my #life# nay even my #fortune#
i #mean# that you #wish# to quit #life# because you do not understand all the enjoyments which are the fruits of a large #fortune#
$m_maximilian_morrel$ i possess nearly a hundred #million# and i give them to you with such a #fortune# you can attain every #wish#
what do you #mean# are you ambitious every career is open to you overturn the #world# change its character yield to mad #idea# be even criminal but live
#count# i have your #word# said $m_maximilian_morrel$ coldly then taking out his watch he added it is #half# past eleven
$m_maximilian_morrel$ can you intend it in my $house_of_peers$ under my very #eye# then let me go said $m_maximilian_morrel$
or i shall think you did not #love# me for my own sake but for yours and he arose it is well said $m_de_monte_cristo$ whose #countenance# brightened at these #word#
you #wish# it you are inflexible yes as you said you are indeed wretched and a miracle alone can cure you
$m_maximilian_morrel$ obeyed the #count# arose and unlocking a closet with a key suspended from his #gold# chain took from it a little silver casket beautifully carved and chased the #corner# of which represented four bending figures similar to the caryatides the forms of #woman# symbols of the angels aspiring to heaven
he placed the casket on the #table# then #opening# it took out a little golden #box# the top of which flew open when touched by a #secret# spring
this #box# contained an unctuous substance partly solid of which it was impossible to discover the color owing to the reflection of the polished #gold# sapphires rubies emeralds which ornamented the #box#
the #count# took out a small quantity of this with a gilt spoon and offered it to $m_maximilian_morrel$ fixing a long steadfast #glance# upon him
sit down $m_maximilian_morrel$ and wait it was a mixed mass of blue red and #gold# it was then observable that the substance was greenish
i #thank# you from the depths of my #heart# said the young #man# taking the spoon from the #hand# of $m_de_monte_cristo$
this is what you asked for he said and what i promised to give you the #count# took another spoon and again dipped it into the golden #box#
well the #fact# is $m_maximilian_morrel$ i was thinking that i too am weary of #life# and since an opportunity presents itself stay said the young #man#
what are you going to do my #friend# asked $m_maximilian_morrel$ arresting his #hand# you who #love# and are beloved you who have faith and #hope# oh do not follow my example
in your #case# it would be a #crime# adieu my noble and generous #friend# adieu i #will# go and tell $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ what you have done for me
and slowly though without any hesitation only waiting to press the #count# #hand# fervently he swallowed the mysterious substance offered by $m_de_monte_cristo$
by degrees the #light# of the lamps gradually faded in the #hand# of the marble statues which held them and the perfumes appeared less powerful to $m_maximilian_morrel$
seated opposite to him $m_de_monte_cristo$ watched him in the #shadow# and $m_maximilian_morrel$ saw #nothing# but the bright #eye# of the #count#
an overpowering sadness took #possession# of the young #man# his #hand# relaxed their hold the objects in the #room# gradually lost their form and color and his disturbed vision seemed to perceive #door# and curtains open in the #wall#
then they were both silent $ali_pasha_of_yanina$ mute and attentive brought the pipes and coffee and disappeared #friend# he cried
i feel that i am dying #thank# he made a last #effort# to extend his #hand# but it fell powerless beside him
then it appeared to him that $m_de_monte_cristo$ smiled not with the strange and fearful #expression# which had sometimes revealed to him the #secret# of his #heart# but with the benevolent kindness of a #father# for a #child#
at the same #time# the #count# appeared to increase in stature his form nearly double its usual height stood out in relief against the red tapestry his black #hair# was thrown back and he stood in the attitude of an avenging angel
$m_maximilian_morrel$ overpowered turned around in the armchair a delicious torpor permeated every vein a change of #idea# presented themselves to his brain like a new design on the kaleidoscope
enervated prostrate and breathless he became unconscious of outward objects he seemed to be entering that vague delirium preceding #death# he wished once again to press the #count# #hand# but his own was immovable
he wished to articulate a last farewell but his tongue lay motionless and heavy in his throat like a #stone# at the mouth of a sepulchre
involuntarily his languid #eye# closed and still through his eyelashes a well known form seemed to move amid the obscurity with which he #thought# himself enveloped
immediately a brilliant #light# from the next #room# or rather from the palace adjoining shone upon the #room# in which he was gently gliding into his last sleep
the #count# had just opened a #door# then he saw a #woman# of marvellous beauty appear on the threshold of the #door# separating the two #room#
pale and sweetly smiling she looked like an angel of mercy conjuring the angel of vengeance is it heaven that opens before me
$m_de_monte_cristo$ pointed out $m_maximilian_morrel$ to the young #woman# who advanced towards him with clasped #hand# and a #smile# upon her #lip#
he mentally ejaculated but his #lip# uttered no #sound# and as though all his #strength# were centred in that internal #emotion# he sighed and closed his #eye#
#thought# the dying #man# that angel resembles the #one# i have lost $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ valentine $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ rushed towards him his #lip# again moved
he is calling you said the #count# he to whom you have confided your destiny he from whom #death# would have separated you calls you to him
happily i vanquished #death# henceforth $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ you #will# never again be separated on #earth# since he has rushed into #death# to find you
without me you would both have died may god accept my atonement in the preservation of these two existences $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ seized the #count# #hand# and in her irresistible impulse of #joy# carried it to her #lip#
oh #thank# me again said the #count# tell me till you are weary that i have restored you to #happiness# you do not know how much i require this assurance
oh yes yes i #thank# you with all my #heart# said $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and if you #doubt# the sincerity of my gratitude oh then ask $haydée$
ask my beloved sister $haydée$ who ever since our departure from france has caused me to wait patiently for this happy #day# while talking to me of you
you then #love# $haydée$ asked $m_de_monte_cristo$ with an #emotion# he in vain endeavored to dissimulate oh yes with all my soul
well then listen $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ said the #count# i have a favor to ask of you of me
oh am i happy enough for that yes you have called $haydée$ your sister let her become so indeed $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ render her all the gratitude
you fancy that you owe to me protect her for the #count# #voice# was thick with #emotion# henceforth she #will# be alone in the #world#
alone in the #world# repeated a #voice# behind the #count# and why $m_de_monte_cristo$ turned around $haydée$ was standing pale motionless looking at the #count# with an #expression# of fearful amazement
because #tomorrow# $haydée$ you #will# be free you #will# then assume your proper #position# in society for i #will# not allow my destiny to overshadow yours
#daughter# of a prince i restore to you the riches and #name# of your #father# $haydée$ became pale and lifting her transparent #hand# to heaven exclaimed in a #voice# stifled with #tear#
then you leave me my lord $haydée$ haydée you are young and beautiful forget even my #name# and be happy
it is well said $haydée$ your #order# shall be executed my lord i #will# forget even your #name# and be happy
exclaimed $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ who was supporting the #head# of $m_maximilian_morrel$ on her #shoulder# do you not see how pale she is
and she stepped back to retire oh heavens do you not see how she suffers $haydée$ answered with a heartrending #expression# why should he understand this my sister
the #count# shuddered at the #tone# of a #voice# which penetrated the inmost recesses of his #heart# his #eye# met those of the young #girl# and he could not bear their brilliancy
he is my #master# and i am his slave he has the #right# to notice #nothing# oh heavens exclaimed $m_de_monte_cristo$ can my suspicions be correct
i am young gently replied $haydée$ i #love# the #life# you have made so sweet to me and i should be sorry to die
$haydée$ would it please you not to leave me you #mean# then that if i leave you $haydée$ i should die yes my lord
do you then #love# me oh $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ he asks if i #love# him $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ tell him if you #love# $m_maximilian_morrel$
the #count# felt his #heart# dilate and throb he opened his #arm# and $haydée$ uttering a #cry# sprang into them
oh yes she cried i do #love# you i #love# you as #one# loves a #father# #brother# #husband# i #love# you as my #life# for you are the best the noblest of created beings
let it be then as you #wish# sweet angel god has sustained me in my struggle with my #enemy# and has given me this reward he #will# not let me #end# my triumph in suffering i wished to punish myself but he has pardoned me
#love# me then $haydée$ who knows perhaps your #love# #will# make me forget all that i do not #wish# to remember
i #mean# that #one# #word# from you has enlightened me more than twenty #year# of slow experience i have but you in the #world# $haydée$ through you i again take hold on #life# through you i shall suffer through you rejoice
what do you #mean# my lord do you hear him $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ exclaimed $haydée$ he says that through me he #will# suffer through me who would yield my #life# for his
the #count# withdrew for a #moment# have i discovered the #truth# he said but whether it be for recompense or punishment i accept my fate
come $haydée$ come and throwing his #arm# around the young #girl# waist he pressed the #hand# of $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and disappeared
an #hour# had nearly passed during which $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ breathless and motionless watched steadfastly over $m_maximilian_morrel$ at #length# she felt his #heart# beat
a faint breath played upon his #lip# a slight shudder announcing the #return# of #life# passed through the young #man# frame
at #length# his #eye# opened but they were at first fixed and expressionless then #sight# returned and with it #feeling# and #grief#
oh he cried in an accent of #despair# the #count# has deceived me i am yet living and extending his #hand# towards the #table# he seized a knife
dearest exclaimed $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ with her adorable #smile# awake and #look# at me $m_maximilian_morrel$ uttered a loud exclamation and frantic doubtful dazzled as though by a celestial vision he fell upon his knees
the next #morning# at daybreak $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ and $m_maximilian_morrel$ were walking #arm# in #arm# on the seashore $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ relating how $m_de_monte_cristo$ had appeared in her #room# explained #everything# revealed the #crime# and finally how he had saved her #life# by enabling her to simulate #death#
they had found the #door# of the grotto opened and gone forth on the azure dome of heaven still glittered a few remaining stars
$m_maximilian_morrel$ soon perceived a #man# standing among the #rock# apparently awaiting a #sign# from them to advance and pointed him out to $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$
ah it is $jacopo_manfredi$ she said the #captain# of the yacht and she beckoned him towards them do you #wish# to speak to us asked $m_maximilian_morrel$
i have a #letter# to give you from the #count# from the #count# murmured the two young #people#
yes read it $m_maximilian_morrel$ opened the #letter# and read my dear $m_maximilian_morrel$ there is a felucca for you at anchor
$jacopo_manfredi$ #will# carry you to leghorn where $monsieur_cavalcanti$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ awaits his granddaughter whom he #wish# to bless before you lead her to the altar
all that is in this grotto my #friend# my $house_of_peers$ in the champs élysées and my château at tréport are the #marriage# gifts bestowed by $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ upon the #son# of his old #master# $m_maximilian_morrel$
$mademoiselle_eugénie_danglars$ $m_noirtier_de_villefort$ #will# share them with you for i entreat her to give to the poor the immense #fortune# reverting to her from her #father# now a madman and her #brother# who died last september with his #mother#
tell the angel who #will# watch over your future destiny $m_maximilian_morrel$ to pray sometimes for a #man# who like satan #thought# himself for an #instant# equal to god but who now acknowledges with christian humility that god alone possesses supreme #power# and infinite wisdom
perhaps those prayers may soften the remorse he feels in his #heart# as for you $m_maximilian_morrel$ this is the #secret# of my conduct towards you
there is neither #happiness# nor misery in the #world# there is only the comparison of #one# state with another #nothing# more
he who has felt the deepest #grief# is best able to experience supreme #happiness# we must have felt what it is to die $m_maximilian_morrel$ that we may appreciate the enjoyments of living
live then and be happy beloved #child# of my #heart# and never forget that until the #day# when god shall deign to reveal the future to #man# all human wisdom is summed up in these two #word#
during the perusal of this #letter# which informed $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ for the first #time# of the madness of her #father# and the #death# of her #brother# she became pale a heavy sigh escaped from her bosom and #tear# not the less painful because they were silent ran down her cheeks her #happiness# cost her very dear
wait and #hope# your #friend# $edmond_dantès$ $m_dantès$ #count# of $m_de_monte_cristo$ $m_maximilian_morrel$ looked around uneasily but he said
the #count# generosity is too overwhelming $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ #will# be satisfied with my humble #fortune# where is the #count# #friend# lead me to him
$jacopo_manfredi$ pointed towards the horizon what do you #mean# asked $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ where is the #count# where is $haydée$ #look# said $jacopo_manfredi$
the #eye# of both were fixed upon the #spot# indicated by the #sailor# and on the blue #line# separating the sky from the mediterranean #sea# they perceived a large white sail
gone said $m_maximilian_morrel$ gone adieu my #friend# adieu my #father# gone murmured $mademoiselle_valentine_de_villefort$ adieu my sweet $haydée$ adieu my sister who can say whether we shall ever see them again said $m_maximilian_morrel$ with tearful #eye#
