Danglars trembled too . ` stop a bit ; ' then knitting his brows into a deep frown , he added , ` surely this can not be one of the Morrel family who lived at Marseilles , and gave us so much trouble from their violent Bonapartism -- '' ","i":274575},{"w":"`` Indeed , '' ","i":274748},{"w":"`` and what did your father say then , Valentine ?

I feel as if it were ordained that this man should be associated with all the good which the future may have in store for me , and sometimes it really seems as if his eye was able to see what was to come , and his hand endowed with the power of directing events according to his own will .

One day you acknowledged that you loved me , and since that day my hope of future happiness has rested on obtaining you , for to gain you would be life to me . Now , I think no more ; I say only that fortune has turned against me -- I had thought to gain heaven , and now I have lost it . It is an every-day occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he possesses but also what he has not . Morrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness ; Valentine looked at him a moment with her large , scrutinizing eyes , endeavoring not to let Morrel discover the grief which struggled in her heart .

Thus was Lady Macbeth served by her conscience , when she sought to give her son , and not her husband -LRB- whatever Shakespeare may say -RRB- , a throne .

You are a noble-minded woman , and it was your grief that disarmed me . But -- and I say it with some pride , Mercédès -- Examine the past and the present , and endeavor to dive into futurity , and then say whether I am not a divine instrument . The most dreadful misfortunes , the most frightful sufferings , the abandonment of all those who loved me , the persecution of those who did not know me , formed the trials of my youth ; when suddenly , from captivity , solitude , misery , I was restored to light and liberty , and became the possessor of a fortune so brilliant , so unbounded , so unheard-of , that I must have been blind not to be conscious that God had endowed me with it to work out his own great designs . God needed me , and I lived . From that time I looked upon this fortune as something confided to me for a particular purpose . Not a thought was given to a life which you once , Mercédès , had the power to render blissful ; not one hour of peaceful calm was mine ; but I felt myself driven on like an exterminating angel . Like adventurous captains about to embark on some enterprise full of danger , I laid in my provisions , I loaded my weapons , I collected every means of attack and defence ; I inured my body to the most violent exercises , my soul to the bitterest trials ; I taught my arm to slay , my eyes to behold excruciating sufferings , and my mouth to smile at the most horrid spectacles . Good-natured , confiding , and forgiving as I had been , I became revengeful , cunning , and wicked , or rather , immovable as fate . Then I launched out into the path that was opened to me .

He placed the casket on the table ; then opening it took out a little golden box , the top of which flew open when touched by a secret spring . This box contained an unctuous substance partly solid , of which it was impossible to discover the color , owing to the reflection of the polished gold , sapphires , rubies , emeralds , which ornamented the box .

The king is either a king or no king ; if he be acknowledged as sovereign of France , he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity ; and this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put down every attempt at conspiracy -- ' tis the best and surest means of preventing mischief .

Having made this well-turned speech , Villefort looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory , much as he would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court . that is exactly what I myself said the other day at the Tuileries , when questioned by his majesty 's principal chamberlain touching the singularity of an alliance between the son of a Girondin and the daughter of an officer of the Duc de Condé ; and I assure you he seemed fully to comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences was based upon sound and excellent principles . Then the king , who , without our suspecting it , had overheard our conversation , interrupted us by saying , ` Villefort ' -- observe that the king did not pronounce the word Noirtier , but , on the contrary , placed considerable emphasis on that of Villefort -- ` Villefort , ' said his majesty , ` is a young man of great judgment and discretion , who will be sure to make a figure in his profession ; I like him much , and it gave me great pleasure to hear that he was about to become the son-in-law of the Marquis and Marquise de Saint-Méran .

Villefort 's first impression was favorable ; but he had been so often warned to mistrust first impulses , that he applied the maxim to the impression , forgetting the difference between the two words . He stifled , therefore , the feelings of compassion that were rising , composed his features , and sat down , grim and sombre , at his desk .

Come , if so you will , count , and continue this conversation at my house , any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of understanding and anxious to refute you , and I will show you my father , M.

Well , sir , the rupture of a blood-vessel on the lobe of the brain has destroyed all this , not in a day , not in an hour , but in a second . M.

Nevertheless , I carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen opportunities of which I spoke just now , and which sudden chance frequently brings about .

He listened for any sound that might be audible , and every time that he rose to the top of a wave he scanned the horizon , and strove to penetrate the darkness .

Three days after , about seven o'clock in the evening , I saw a servant on horseback leave the house at full gallop , and take the road to Sèvres .

The chief beauty of trees consists in the deep shadow of their umbrageous boughs , while fancy pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms flitting and passing beneath that shade . Here I have a garden laid out in such a way as to afford the fullest scope for the imagination , and furnished with thickly grown trees , beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may conjure up phantoms at will . This to me , who expected but to find a blank enclosure surrounded by a straight wall , is , I assure you , a most agreeable surprise . I have no fear of ghosts , and I have never heard it said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years as is wrought by the living in a single day . Should your confessor be less indulgent to you in your dying moments than you found the Abbé Busoni , send for me , if I am still on earth , and I will soothe your ears with words that shall effectually calm and soothe your parting soul Retire within , Bertuccio , and tranquillize your mind . ere it goes forth to traverse the ocean called eternity .

Both the count and Baptistin had told the truth when they announced to Morcerf the proposed visit of the major , which had served Monte Cristo as a pretext for declining Albert 's invitation . Seven o'clock had just struck , and M. Bertuccio , according to the command which had been given him , had two hours before left for Auteuil , when a cab stopped at the door , and after depositing its occupant at the gate , immediately hurried away , as if ashamed of its employment . The visitor was about fifty-two years of age , dressed in one of the green surtouts , ornamented with black frogs , which have so long maintained their popularity all over Europe . He wore trousers of blue cloth , boots tolerably clean , but not of the brightest polish , and a little too thick in the soles , buckskin gloves , a hat somewhat resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes , and a black cravat striped with white , which , if the proprietor had not worn it of his own free will , might have passed for a halter , so much did it resemble one . Such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate , and demanded if it was not at No. 30 in the Avenue des Champs-Élysées that the Count of Monte Cristo lived , and who , being answered by the porter in the affirmative , entered , closed the gate after him , and began to ascend the steps .

Franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had already had with his mysterious tormentor , and in waking speculations as to what the morrow would produce . The next day must clear up every doubt ; and unless his near neighbor and would-be friend , the Count of Monte Cristo , possessed the ring of Gyges , and by its power was able to render himself invisible , it was very certain he could not escape this time .

The two assistants had borne Andrea to the scaffold , and there , in spite of his struggles , his bites , and his cries , had forced him to his knees . During this time the executioner had raised his mace , and signed to them to get out of the way ; the criminal strove to rise , but , ere he had time , the mace fell on his left temple . A dull and heavy sound was heard , and the man dropped like an ox on his face , and then turned over on his back .

He has lost four or five vessels , and suffered by three or four bankruptcies ; but it is not for me , although I am a creditor myself to the amount of ten thousand francs , to give any information as to the state of his finances . Ask of me , as mayor , what is my opinion of M. Morrel , and I shall say that he is a man honorable to the last degree , and who has up to this time fulfilled every engagement with scrupulous punctuality . This is all I can say , sir ; if you wish to learn more , address yourself to M. de Boville , the inspector of prisons , ; he has , I believe , two hundred thousand francs in Morrel 's hands , and if there be any grounds for apprehension , as this is a greater amount than mine , you will most probably find him better informed than myself . The Englishman seemed to appreciate this extreme delicacy , made his bow and went away , proceeding with a characteristic British stride towards the street mentioned . M. de Boville was in his private room , and the Englishman , on perceiving him , made a gesture of surprise , which seemed to indicate that it was not the first time he had been in his presence . As to M. de Boville , he was in such a state of despair , that it was evident all the faculties of his mind , absorbed in the thought which occupied him at the moment , did not allow either his memory or his imagination to stray to the past . The Englishman , with the coolness of his nation , addressed him in terms nearly similar to those with which he had accosted the mayor of Marseilles .

I had informed M.

The elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation , like that of all who have experienced many trials , contained many useful and important hints as well as sound information ; but it was never egotistical , for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows . Dantès listened with admiring attention to all he said ; some of his remarks corresponded with what he already knew , or applied to the sort of knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire . A part of the good abbé 's words , however , were wholly incomprehensible to him ; but , like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes , opened new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener , and gave fantastic glimpses of new horizons , enabling him justly to estimate the delight an intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as Faria along the heights of truth , where he was so much at home .

It was also considered a luxury to have them alive , it being an amusing sight to see them die , for , when dying , they change color three or four times , and like the rainbow when it disappears , pass through all the prismatic shades , after which they were sent to the kitchen .

Upon which he offered to take Cavalcanti in his carriage to the Hôtel des Princes , if it would not be depriving him of the company of his son . To this Cavalcanti replied by saying that for some time past his son had lived independently of him , that he had his own horses and carriages , and that not having come together , it would not be difficult for them to leave separately . The major seated himself , therefore , by the side of Danglars , who was more and more charmed with the ideas of order and economy which ruled this man , and yet who , being able to allow his son 60,000 francs a year , might be supposed to possess a fortune of 500,000 or 600,000 livres . As for Andrea , he began , by way of showing off , to scold his groom , who , instead of bringing the tilbury to the steps of the house , had taken it to the outer door , thus giving him the trouble of walking thirty steps to reach it . The groom heard him with humility , took the bit of the impatient animal with his left hand , and with the right held out the reins to Andrea , who , taking them from him , rested his polished boot lightly on the step . The young man turned round , thinking that Danglars or Monte Cristo had forgotten something they wished to tell him , and had returned just as they were starting . But instead of either of these , he saw nothing but a strange face , sunburnt , and encircled by a beard , with eyes brilliant as carbuncles , and a smile upon the mouth which displayed a perfect set of white teeth , pointed and sharp as the wolf 's or jackal 's . A red handkerchief encircled his gray head ; torn and filthy garments covered his large bony limbs , which seemed as though , like those of a skeleton , they would rattle as he walked ; and the hand with which he leaned upon the young man 's shoulder , and which was the first thing Andrea saw , seemed of gigantic size . Did the young man recognize that face by the light of the lantern in his tilbury , or was he merely struck with the horrible appearance of his interrogator ?

He is a charming fellow , I allow , when his news is correct ; but when it is not , there are fifty others in the world who would do better than he . Madame Danglars was rooted to the spot ; she made a violent effort to reply to this last attack , but she fell upon a chair thinking of Villefort , of the dinner scene , of the strange series of misfortunes which had taken place in her house during the last few days , and changed the usual calm of her establishment to a scene of scandalous debate . He shut the bedroom door after him , without adding another word , and returned to his apartments ; and when Madame Danglars recovered from her half-fainting condition , she could almost believe that she had had a disagreeable dream .

Pyramus and Thisbe About two-thirds of the way along the Faubourg Saint-Honoré , and in the rear of one of the most imposing mansions in this rich neighborhood , where the various houses vie with each other for elegance of design and magnificence of construction , extended a large garden , where the wide-spreading chestnut-trees raised their heads high above the walls in a solid rampart , and with the coming of every spring scattered a shower of delicate pink and white blossoms into the large stone vases that stood upon the two square pilasters of a curiously wrought iron gate , that dated from the time of Louis XIII . This noble entrance , however , in spite of its striking appearance and the graceful effect of the geraniums planted in the two vases , as they waved their variegated leaves in the wind and charmed the eye with their scarlet bloom , had fallen into utter disuse . The proprietors of the mansion had many years before thought it best to confine themselves to the possession of the house itself , with its thickly planted courtyard , opening into the Faubourg Saint-Honoré , and to the garden shut in by this gate , which formerly communicated with a fine kitchen-garden of about an acre . For the demon of speculation drew a line , or in other words projected a street , at the farther side of the kitchen-garden . The street was laid out , a name was chosen and posted up on an iron plate , but before construction was begun , it occurred to the possessor of the property that a handsome sum might be obtained for the ground then devoted to fruits and vegetables , by building along the line of the proposed street , and so making it a branch of communication with the Faubourg Saint-Honoré itself , one of the most important thoroughfares in the city of Paris . From some such difficulty the newly named street died almost in birth , and the purchaser of the kitchen-garden , having paid a high price for it , and being quite unable to find anyone willing to take his bargain off his hands without a considerable loss , yet still clinging to the belief that at some future day he should obtain a sum for it that would repay him , not only for his past outlay , but also the interest upon the capital locked up in his new acquisition , contented himself with letting the ground temporarily to some market-gardeners , at a yearly rental of 500 francs . And so , as we have said , the iron gate leading into the kitchen-garden had been closed up and left to the rust , which bade fair before long to eat off its hinges , while to prevent the ignoble glances of the diggers and delvers of the ground from presuming to sully the aristocratic enclosure belonging to the mansion , the gate had been boarded up to a height of six feet . True , the planks were not so closely adjusted but that a hasty peep might be obtained through their interstices ; but the strict decorum and rigid propriety of the inhabitants of the house left no grounds for apprehending that advantage would be taken of that circumstance . Horticulture seemed , however , to have been abandoned in the deserted kitchen-garden ; and where cabbages , carrots , radishes , peas , and melons had once flourished , a scanty crop of lucern alone bore evidence of its being deemed worthy of cultivation . A small , low door gave egress from the walled space we have been describing into the projected street , the ground having been abandoned as unproductive by its various renters , and had now fallen so completely in general estimation as to return not even the one-half per cent it had originally paid . Towards the house the chestnut-trees we have before mentioned rose high above the wall , without in any way affecting the growth of other luxuriant shrubs and flowers that eagerly dressed forward to fill up the vacant spaces , as though asserting their right to enjoy the boon of light and air . At one corner , where the foliage became so thick as almost to shut out day , a large stone bench and sundry rustic seats indicated that this sheltered spot was either in general favor or particular use by some inhabitant of the house , which was faintly discernible through the dense mass of verdure that partially concealed it , though situated but a hundred paces off . Whoever had selected this retired portion of the grounds as the boundary of a walk , or as a place for meditation , was abundantly justified in the choice by the absence of all glare , the cool , refreshing shade , the screen it afforded from the scorching rays of the sun , that found no entrance there even during the burning days of hottest summer , the incessant and melodious warbling of birds , and the entire removal from either the noise of the street or the bustle of the mansion . On the evening of one of the warmest days spring had yet bestowed on the inhabitants of Paris , might be seen negligently thrown upon the stone bench , a book , a parasol , and a work-basket , from which hung a partly embroidered cambric handkerchief , while at a little distance from these articles was a young woman , standing close to the iron gate , endeavoring to discern something on the other side by means of the openings in the planks , -- the earnestness of her attitude and the fixed gaze with which she seemed to seek the object of her wishes , proving how much her feelings were interested in the matter . At that instant the little side-gate leading from the waste ground to the street was noiselessly opened , and a tall , powerful young man appeared . He was dressed in a common gray blouse and velvet cap , but his carefully arranged hair , beard and moustache , all of the richest and glossiest black , ill accorded with his plebeian attire . After casting a rapid glance around him , in order to assure himself that he was unobserved , he entered by the small gate , and , carefully closing and securing it after him , proceeded with a hurried step towards the barrier . At the sight of him she expected , though probably not in such a costume , the young woman started in terror , and was about to make a hasty retreat . But the eye of love had already seen , even through the narrow chinks of the wooden palisades , the movement of the white robe , and observed the fluttering of the blue sash .

An Academician would say that the entertainments of the fashionable world are collections of flowers which attract inconstant butterflies , famished bees , and buzzing drones . No one could deny that the rooms were splendidly illuminated ; the light streamed forth on the gilt mouldings and the silk hangings ; and all the bad taste of decorations , which had only their richness to boast of , shone in its splendor .

'' ","i":216948},{"w":"`` I promise you . Au revoir , Albert . Gentlemen , good morning . '' ","i":216973},{"w":"`` '' ","i":217038},{"w":"`` For heaven 's sake , Beauchamp , '' ","i":217040},{"w":"`` do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him everywhere . Is he not peculiar ? '' ","i":217052},{"w":"`` '' ","i":217924},{"w":"`` Ah , monsieur , '' ","i":217926},{"w":"`` I would never forgive you this mistake if you had seen another picture beside this . You do not know my mother ; she it is whom you see here . This costume is a fancy one , it appears , and the resemblance is so great that I think I still see my mother the same as she was in 1830 . She had her portrait painted thus six or eight years ago . The countess had this portrait painted during the count 's absence . She doubtless intended giving him an agreeable surprise ; but , strange to say , this portrait seemed to displease my father , and the value of the picture , which is , as you see , one of the best works of Léopold Robert , could not overcome his dislike to it . It is true , between ourselves , that M. de Morcerf is one of the most assiduous peers at the Luxembourg , a general renowned for theory , but a most mediocre amateur of art . It is different with my mother , who paints exceedingly well , and who , unwilling to part with so valuable a picture , gave it to me to put here , where it would be less likely to displease M. de Morcerf , whose portrait , by Gros , I will also show you . Excuse my talking of family matters , but as I shall have the honor of introducing you to the count , I tell you this to prevent you making any allusions to this picture . The picture seems to have a malign influence , for my mother rarely comes here without looking at it , and still more rarely does she look at it without weeping . This disagreement is the only one that has ever taken place between the count and countess , who are still as much united , although married more than twenty years , as on the first day of their wedding . Monte Cristo glanced rapidly at Albert , as if to seek a hidden meaning in his words , but it was evident the young man uttered them in the simplicity of his heart . Now , '' ","i":217935},{"w":"`` that you have seen all my treasures , allow me to offer them to you , unworthy as they are . Consider yourself as in your own house , and to put yourself still more at your ease , pray accompany me to the apartments of M. de Morcerf , he whom I wrote from Rome an account of the services you rendered me , and to whom I announced your promised visit , and I may say that both the count and countess anxiously desire to thank you in person . '' ","i":218316},{"w":"`` You are somewhat blasé I know , and family scenes have not much effect on Sinbad the Sailor , who has seen so many others . Monte Cristo bowed without making any answer ; he accepted the offer without enthusiasm and without regret , as one of those conventions of society which every gentleman looks upon as a duty . Albert summoned his servant , and ordered him to acquaint M. and Madame de Morcerf of the arrival of the Count of Monte Cristo . However , accept what I propose to you as an initiation into Parisian life -- a life of politeness , visiting , and introductions . '' ","i":218411},{"w":"`` It is not indiscreet , '' ","i":218699},{"w":"`` Yes , you are at once from Provence and Spain ; that explains , if the portrait you showed me be like , the dark hue I so much admired on the visage of the noble Catalan . It would have required the penetration of Œdipus or the Sphinx to have divined the irony the count concealed beneath these words , apparently uttered with the greatest politeness . Morcerf thanked him with a smile , and pushed open the door above which were his arms , and which , as we have said , opened into the salon . you are more fortunate than the government , for your arms are really beautiful , and speak to the imagination . '' ","i":219017},{"w":"`` '' ","i":219596},{"w":"`` The countess , '' ","i":219598},{"w":"`` was at her toilet when she was informed of the visit she was about to receive . It is a great honor to me , '' ","i":219606},{"w":"`` Oh , '' ","i":219716},{"w":"`` I have left the service , monsieur . I could , therefore , expect a higher rank , and who knows what might have happened had the elder branch remained on the throne ? But the Revolution of July was , it seems , sufficiently glorious to allow itself to be ungrateful , and it was so for all services that did not date from the imperial period . I tendered my resignation , for when you have gained your epaulets on the battle-field , you do not know how to manœuvre on the slippery grounds of the salons . Made a peer at the Restoration , I served through the first campaign under the orders of Marshal Bourmont . I have hung up my sword , and cast myself into politics . I have devoted myself to industry ; I study the useful arts . During the twenty years I served , I often wished to do so , but I had not the time . A gentleman of high birth , possessor of an ample fortune , you have consented to gain your promotion as an obscure soldier , step by step -- this is uncommon ; then become general , peer of France , commander of the Legion of Honor , you consent to again commence a second apprenticeship , without any other hope or any other desire than that of one day becoming useful to your fellow-creatures ; this , indeed , is praiseworthy , -- nay , more , it is sublime . 20265m Albert looked on and listened with astonishment ; he was not used to see Monte Cristo give vent to such bursts of enthusiasm .

How did your father receive him , Albert ? It is necessary that we should be more than complaisant to the count .

Leisurely turning round , they calmly scrutinized the various countenances around them , as though demanding some one person who would take upon himself the responsibility of what they deemed excessive impertinence ; but as no one responded to the challenge , the friends turned again to the front of the theatre , and affected to busy themselves with the stage .

The next morning , as soon as he awoke , Danglars asked for the newspapers ; they were brought to him ; he laid aside three or four , and at last fixed on l'Impartial , the paper of which Beauchamp was the chief editor . He hastily tore off the cover , opened the journal with nervous precipitation , passed contemptuously over the Paris jottings , and arriving at the miscellaneous intelligence , stopped with a malicious smile , at a paragraph headed We hear from Yanina .

When he had concluded his speech , Beauchamp bowed coldly to Albert , turned his back upon him , and went to the press-room . Albert vented his anger on a pile of newspapers , which he sent flying all over the office by switching them violently with his stick ; after which ebullition he departed -- not , however , without walking several times to the door of the press-room , as if he had half a mind to enter . While Albert was lashing the front of his carriage in the same manner that he had the newspapers which were the innocent agents of his discomfiture , as he was crossing the barrier he perceived Morrel , who was walking with a quick step and a bright eye . He was passing the Chinese Baths , and appeared to have come from the direction of the Porte Saint-Martin , and to be going towards the Madeleine .

As they drew near the island seemed to lift from the sea , and the air was so clear that they could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another , like cannon balls in an arsenal , with green bushes and trees growing in the crevices . As for the sailors , although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was evident that they were on the alert , and that they carefully watched the glassy surface over which they were sailing , and on which a few fishing-boats , with their white sails , were alone visible . They were within fifteen miles of Monte Cristo when the sun began to set behind Corsica , whose mountains appeared against the sky , showing their rugged peaks in bold relief ; this mass of rock , like the giant Adamastor , rose dead ahead , a formidable barrier , and intercepting the light that gilded its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow . Little by little the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the expiring day ; at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain , where it paused an instant , like the fiery crest of a volcano , then gloom gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base , and the island now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker ; half an hour after , the night was quite dark . Fortunately , the mariners were used to these latitudes , and knew every rock in the Tuscan Archipelago ; for in the midst of this obscurity Corsica had long since disappeared , and Monte Cristo itself was invisible ; but the sailors seemed , like the lynx , to see in the dark , and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest hesitation . An hour had passed since the sun had set , when Franz fancied he saw , at a quarter of a mile to the left , a dark mass , but he could not precisely make out what it was , and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud for land , he remained silent ; suddenly a great light appeared on the strand ; land might resemble a cloud , but the fire was not a meteor . as I wish to enjoy it as long as possible , steer for Monte Cristo .
