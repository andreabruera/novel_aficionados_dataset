first act scene morning #room# in $algernon_moncrieff$ flat in half moon street the #room# is luxuriously and artistically furnished the sound of a piano is heard in the adjoining #room#
$lane$ is arranging afternoon #tea# on the table and after the music has ceased $algernon_moncrieff$ enters $algernon_moncrieff$ did you hear what i was playing $lane$
$lane$ i didnt think it polite to listen #sir# $algernon_moncrieff$ i sorry for that for your sake i dont play accurately any #one# can play accurately but i play with wonderful expression
as far as the piano is concerned sentiment is my forte i keep science for #life# $lane$ yes #sir# $algernon_moncrieff$ and speaking of the science of #life# have you got the cucumber sandwiches cut for $lady_bracknell$
oh by the #way# $lane$ i see from your book that on thursday night when lord shoreman and $mr_ernest_worthing$ were dining with me eight bottles of champagne are entered as having been consumed
$lane$ yes #sir# #hand# them on a salver $algernon_moncrieff$ inspects them takes two and sits down on the sofa $lane$ yes #sir# eight bottles and a pint
$algernon_moncrieff$ why is it that at a bachelor establishment the servants invariably drink the champagne i ask merely for information $lane$
i attribute it to the superior quality of the wine #sir# i have often observed that in married households the champagne is rarely of a first rate brand
$algernon_moncrieff$ good heavens is marriage so demoralising as that $lane$ i believe it is a very pleasant state #sir# i have had very little experience of it myself up to the present
i have only been married once that was in consequence of a misunderstanding between myself and a young person $algernon_moncrieff$ languidly
i dont know that i am much interested in your family #life# $lane$ lane no #sir# it is not a very interesting subject
i never think of it myself $algernon_moncrieff$ very natural i am sure that will do $lane$ thank you $lane$ thank you #sir#
$lane$ goes out $algernon_moncrieff$ $lane$ views on marriage seem somewhat lax really if the lower orders dont set us a good example what on earth is the use of them
they seem as a class to have absolutely no sense of moral responsibility enter $lane$ lane $mr_ernest_worthing$ enter $uncle_jack$
$lane$ goes out $algernon_moncrieff$ how are you my dear $mr_ernest_worthing$ what brings you up to #town# $uncle_jack$ oh pleasure pleasure
what else should bring #one# anywhere eating as usual i see algy $algernon_moncrieff$ stiffly i believe it is customary in good society to take some slight refreshment at five clock
where have you been since last thursday $uncle_jack$ sitting down on the sofa in the #country# $algernon_moncrieff$ what on earth do you do there
$uncle_jack$ pulling off his gloves when #one# is in #town# #one# amuses oneself when #one# is in the #country# #one# amuses other #people#
it is excessively boring $algernon_moncrieff$ and who are the #people# you amuse $uncle_jack$ airily oh neighbours neighbours $algernon_moncrieff$ got nice neighbours in your part of shropshire
$uncle_jack$ perfectly horrid never speak to #one# of them $algernon_moncrieff$ how immensely you must amuse them goes over and takes sandwich
by the #way# shropshire is your county is it not $uncle_jack$ eh shropshire yes of course hallo why all these cups
why cucumber sandwiches why such reckless extravagance in #one# so young who is coming to #tea# $algernon_moncrieff$ oh merely aunt augusta and $gwendolen$
$uncle_jack$ how perfectly delightful $algernon_moncrieff$ yes that is all very well but i am afraid aunt augusta wont quite approve of your being here
$uncle_jack$ may i ask why $algernon_moncrieff$ my dear fellow the #way# you flirt with $gwendolen$ is perfectly disgraceful it is almost as bad as the #way# $gwendolen$ flirts with you
$uncle_jack$ i am in love with $gwendolen$ i have come up to #town# expressly to propose to her $algernon_moncrieff$ i thought you had come up for pleasure
i call that business $uncle_jack$ how utterly unromantic you are $algernon_moncrieff$ i really dont see #anything# romantic in proposing it is very romantic to be in love
but there is nothing romantic about a definite proposal why #one# may be accepted #one# usually is i believe then the excitement is all over
the very essence of romance is uncertainty if ever i get married i ll certainly try to forget the #fact# $uncle_jack$ i have no doubt about that dear algy
the divorce court was specially invented for #people# whose memories are so curiously constituted $algernon_moncrieff$ oh there is no use speculating on that subject
divorces are made in heaven $uncle_jack$ puts out his #hand# to take a sandwich $algernon_moncrieff$ at once interferes please dont touch the cucumber sandwiches
they are ordered specially for aunt augusta takes #one# and eats it $uncle_jack$ well you have been eating them all the #time#
$algernon_moncrieff$ that is quite a different matter she is my aunt takes plate from below have some bread and butter the bread and butter is for $gwendolen$
$gwendolen$ is devoted to bread and butter $uncle_jack$ advancing to table and helping himself and very good bread and butter it is too
$algernon_moncrieff$ well my dear fellow you need not eat as if you were going to eat it all you behave as if you were married to her already
you are not married to her already and i dont think you ever will be $uncle_jack$ why on earth do you say that
$algernon_moncrieff$ well in the first place #girl# never marry the #man# they flirt with #girl# dont think it right $uncle_jack$ oh that is nonsense
$algernon_moncrieff$ it isnt it is a great truth it accounts for the extraordinary number of bachelors that #one# sees all over the place
in the second place i dont give my consent $uncle_jack$ your consent $algernon_moncrieff$ my dear fellow $gwendolen$ is my first cousin
and before i allow you to marry her you will have to clear up the whole question of $miss_cecily_cardew$ rings bell
$uncle_jack$ $miss_cecily_cardew$ what on earth do you mean what do you mean algy by $miss_cecily_cardew$ i dont know any #one# of the #name# of $miss_cecily_cardew$
enter $lane$ $algernon_moncrieff$ bring me that cigarette #case# $mr_ernest_worthing$ left in the smoking #room# the last #time# he dined here
$lane$ yes #sir# $lane$ goes out $uncle_jack$ do you mean to say you have had my cigarette #case# all this #time#
i wish to goodness you had let me know i have been writing frantic letters to scotland yard about it i was very nearly offering a large reward
$algernon_moncrieff$ well i wish you would offer #one# i happen to be more than usually hard up $uncle_jack$ there is no good offering a large reward now that the #thing# is found
enter $lane$ with the cigarette #case# on a salver $algernon_moncrieff$ takes it at once $lane$ goes out $algernon_moncrieff$ i think that is rather mean of you $mr_ernest_worthing$ i must say
however it makes no matter for now that i look at the inscription inside i find that the #thing# isnt yours after all
you have seen me with it a hundred #time# and you have no right whatsoever to read what is written inside
opens #case# and examines it $uncle_jack$ of course it mine moving to him it is a very ungentlemanly #thing# to read a private cigarette #case#
$algernon_moncrieff$ oh it is absurd to have a hard and fast rule about what #one# should read and what #one# shouldnt
more than half of modern culture depends on what #one# shouldnt read $uncle_jack$ i am quite aware of the #fact# and i dont propose to discuss modern culture
it isnt the sort of #thing# #one# should talk of in private i simply want my cigarette #case# back $algernon_moncrieff$ yes but this isnt your cigarette #case#
this cigarette #case# is a present from some #one# of the #name# of $miss_cecily_cardew$ and you said you didnt know any #one# of that #name#
$uncle_jack$ well if you want to know $miss_cecily_cardew$ happens to be my aunt $algernon_moncrieff$ your aunt $uncle_jack$ yes charming old lady she is too
#life# at tunbridge wells just give it back to me algy $algernon_moncrieff$ retreating to back of sofa but why does she call herself little $miss_cecily_cardew$ if she is your aunt and #life# at tunbridge wells
reading from little $miss_cecily_cardew$ with her fondest love $uncle_jack$ moving to sofa and kneeling upon it my dear fellow what on earth is there in that
some aunts are tall some aunts are not tall that is a matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself
you seem to think that every aunt should be exactly like your aunt that is absurd for heaven sake give me back my cigarette #case#
follows $algernon_moncrieff$ round the #room# $algernon_moncrieff$ yes but why does your aunt call you her uncle from little $miss_cecily_cardew$ with her fondest love to her dear $uncle_jack$
there is no objection i admit to an aunt being a small aunt but why an aunt no matter what her size may be should call her own nephew her uncle i cant quite make out
besides your #name# isnt $uncle_jack$ at all it is $mr_ernest_worthing$ $uncle_jack$ it isnt $mr_ernest_worthing$ it $uncle_jack$ $algernon_moncrieff$ you have always told me it was $mr_ernest_worthing$
i have introduced you to every #one# as $mr_ernest_worthing$ you answer to the #name# of $mr_ernest_worthing$ you look as if your #name# was $mr_ernest_worthing$
you are the most earnest looking person i ever saw in my #life# it is perfectly absurd your saying that your #name# isnt $mr_ernest_worthing$
it on your cards here is #one# of them taking it from #case# $mr_ernest_worthing$ the albany
i ll keep this as a proof that your #name# is $mr_ernest_worthing$ if ever you attempt to deny it to me or to $gwendolen$ or to any #one# else
well my #name# is $mr_ernest_worthing$ in #town# and $uncle_jack$ in the #country# and the cigarette #case# was given to me in the #country#
yes but that does not account for the #fact# that your small aunt $miss_cecily_cardew$ who #life# at tunbridge wells calls you her dear uncle
puts the card in his pocket $uncle_jack$ $algernon_moncrieff$ come old boy you had much better have the #thing# out at once
$uncle_jack$ my dear algy you talk exactly as if you were a dentist it is very vulgar to talk like a dentist when #one# isnt a dentist
it produces a false impression $algernon_moncrieff$ well that is exactly what dentists always do now go on tell me the whole #thing#
i may mention that i have always suspected you of being a confirmed and secret bunburyist and i am quite sure of it now
i ll reveal to you the meaning of that incomparable expression as soon as you are kind enough to inform me why you are $mr_ernest_worthing$ in #town# and $uncle_jack$ in the #country#
$uncle_jack$ bunburyist what on earth do you mean by a bunburyist $algernon_moncrieff$ $uncle_jack$ well produce my cigarette #case# first $algernon_moncrieff$ here it is
#hand# cigarette #case# now produce your explanation and pray make it improbable sits on sofa $uncle_jack$ my dear fellow there is nothing improbable about my explanation at all
old mr thomas $miss_cecily_cardew$ who adopted me when i was a little boy made me in his will guardian to his grand daughter $miss_cecily_cardew$
$miss_cecily_cardew$ who addresses me as her uncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate #life# at my place in the #country# under the charge of her admirable governess miss prism
in #fact# it perfectly ordinary $algernon_moncrieff$ where is that place in the #country# by the #way# $uncle_jack$ that is nothing to you dear boy
you are not going to be invited i may tell you candidly that the place is not in shropshire
$algernon_moncrieff$ i suspected that my dear fellow i have bunburyed all over shropshire on two separate occasions now go on why are you $mr_ernest_worthing$ in #town# and $uncle_jack$ in the #country#
$uncle_jack$ my dear algy i dont know whether you will be able to understand my real motives you are hardly serious enough
when #one# is placed in the position of guardian #one# has to adopt a very high moral tone on all subjects
and as a high moral tone can hardly be said to conduce very much to either #one# health or #one# happiness in order to get up to #town#
i have always pretended to have a younger #brother# of the #name# of $mr_ernest_worthing$ who #life# in the albany and gets into the most dreadful scrapes
it #one# duty to do so that my dear algy is the whole truth pure and simple $algernon_moncrieff$ the truth is rarely pure and never simple
modern #life# would be very tedious if it were either and modern literature a complete impossibility $uncle_jack$ that wouldnt be at all a bad #thing#
$algernon_moncrieff$ literary criticism is not your forte my dear fellow dont try it you should leave that to #people# who havent been at a university
they do it so well in the daily papers what you really are is a bunburyist i was quite right in saying you were a bunburyist
you have invented a very useful younger #brother# called $mr_ernest_worthing$ in order that you may be able to come up to #town# as often as you like
i have invented an invaluable permanent invalid called $mr_bunbury$ in order that i may be able to go down into the #country# whenever i choose
you are #one# of the most advanced bunburyists i know $uncle_jack$ what on earth do you mean $algernon_moncrieff$ $mr_bunbury$ is perfectly invaluable
if it wasnt for $mr_bunbury$ extraordinary bad health for instance i wouldnt be able to dine with you at willis to night for i have been really engaged to aunt augusta for more than a week
$uncle_jack$ i havent asked you to dine with me anywhere to night $algernon_moncrieff$ i know you are absurdly careless about sending out invitations
it is very foolish of you nothing annoys #people# so much as not receiving invitations $uncle_jack$ you had much better dine with your aunt augusta
to begin with i dined there on monday and once a week is quite enough to dine with #one# own relations
in the second place whenever i do dine there i am always treated as a member of the family and sent down with either no #woman# at all or two
$algernon_moncrieff$ i havent the smallest intention of doing #anything# of the kind in the third place i know perfectly well whom she will place me next to to night
she will place me next mary farquhar who always flirts with her own husband across the dinner table that is not very pleasant
indeed it is not even decent and that sort of #thing# is enormously on the increase the amount of #woman# in london who flirt with their own husbands is perfectly scandalous
it looks so bad it is simply washing #one# clean linen in public besides now that i know you to be a confirmed bunburyist i naturally want to talk to you about bunburying
i want to tell you the rules $uncle_jack$ i not a bunburyist at all if $gwendolen$ accepts me i am going to kill my #brother#
indeed i think i ll kill him in any #case# $miss_cecily_cardew$ is a little too much interested in him it is rather a bore
so i am going to get rid of $mr_ernest_worthing$ and i strongly advise you to do the same with mr
nothing will induce me to part with $mr_bunbury$ and if you ever get married which seems to me extremely problematic you will be very glad to know $mr_bunbury$
with your invalid friend who has the absurd #name# $algernon_moncrieff$ a #man# who marries without knowing $mr_bunbury$ has a very tedious #time# of it
if i marry a charming #girl# like $gwendolen$ and she is the only #girl# i ever saw in my #life# that i would marry i certainly wont want to know $mr_bunbury$
$uncle_jack$ that is nonsense $algernon_moncrieff$ then your wife will you dont seem to realise that in married #life# three is company and two is none
that my dear young friend is the theory that the corrupt french drama has been propounding for the last fifty #year#
$uncle_jack$ sententiously $algernon_moncrieff$ yes and that the happy english home has proved in half the #time# $uncle_jack$ for heaven sake dont try to be cynical
it perfectly easy to be cynical $algernon_moncrieff$ my dear fellow it isnt easy to be #anything# nowadays there such a lot of beastly competition about
the sound of an electric bell is heard ah that must be aunt augusta only relatives or creditors ever ring in that wagnerian manner
now if i get her out of the #way# for ten minutes so that you can have an opportunity for proposing to $gwendolen$ may i dine with you to night at willis
$uncle_jack$ i suppose so if you want to $algernon_moncrieff$ yes but you must be serious about it i hate #people# who are not serious about meals
it is so shallow of them enter $lane$ lane $lady_bracknell$ and miss fairfax $algernon_moncrieff$ goes forward to meet them enter $lady_bracknell$ and $gwendolen$
$lady_bracknell$ good afternoon dear $algernon_moncrieff$ i hope you are behaving very well $algernon_moncrieff$ i feeling very well aunt augusta $lady_bracknell$
that not quite the same #thing# in #fact# the two #thing# rarely go together sees $uncle_jack$ and bows to him with icy coldness
$algernon_moncrieff$ to $gwendolen$ dear me you are smart $gwendolen$ i am always smart am i not $mr_ernest_worthing$ $uncle_jack$ you re quite perfect miss fairfax
$gwendolen$ oh i hope i am not that it would leave no #room# for developments and i intend to develop in many directions
$gwendolen$ and $uncle_jack$ sit down together in the corner $lady_bracknell$ i sorry if we are a little late $algernon_moncrieff$ but i was obliged to call on dear lady harbury
i hadnt been there since her poor husband death i never saw a #woman# so altered she looks quite twenty #year# younger
and now i ll have a cup of #tea# and #one# of those nice cucumber sandwiches you promised me $algernon_moncrieff$ certainly aunt augusta
goes over to #tea# table $lady_bracknell$ wont you come and sit here $gwendolen$ gwendolen thanks mamma i quite comfortable where i am
$algernon_moncrieff$ picking up empty plate in horror good heavens $lane$ why are there no cucumber sandwiches i ordered them specially $lane$
gravely there were no cucumbers in the market this morning #sir# i went down twice $algernon_moncrieff$ no cucumbers $lane$ no #sir#
not even for ready money $algernon_moncrieff$ that will do $lane$ thank you $lane$ thank you #sir# goes out $algernon_moncrieff$ i am greatly distressed aunt augusta about there being no cucumbers not even for ready money
$lady_bracknell$ it really makes no matter $algernon_moncrieff$ i had some crumpets with lady harbury who seems to me to be living entirely for pleasure now
$algernon_moncrieff$ i hear her hair has turned quite gold from grief $lady_bracknell$ it certainly has changed its colour from what cause i of course cannot say
$algernon_moncrieff$ crosses and #hand# #tea# thank you i ve quite a treat for you to night $algernon_moncrieff$ i am going to send you down with mary farquhar
she is such a nice #woman# and so attentive to her husband it delightful to watch them $algernon_moncrieff$ i am afraid aunt augusta i shall have to give up the pleasure of dining with you to night after all
$lady_bracknell$ frowning i hope not $algernon_moncrieff$ it would put my table completely out your uncle would have to dine upstairs
fortunately he is accustomed to that $algernon_moncrieff$ it is a great bore and i need hardly say a terrible disappointment to me but
the #fact# is i have just had a telegram to say that my poor friend $mr_bunbury$ is very ill again exchanges glances with $uncle_jack$
they seem to think i should be with him $lady_bracknell$ it is very strange this $mr_bunbury$ seems to suffer from curiously bad health
well i must say $algernon_moncrieff$ that i think it is high #time# that $mr_bunbury$ made up his mind whether he was going to live or to die
$algernon_moncrieff$ yes poor $mr_bunbury$ is a dreadful invalid $lady_bracknell$ this shilly shallying with the question is absurd nor do i in any #way# approve of the modern sympathy with invalids
i consider it morbid illness of any kind is hardly a #thing# to be encouraged in others health is the primary duty of #life#
i am always telling that to your poor uncle but he never seems to take much notice as far as any improvement in his ailment goes
i should be much obliged if you would ask $mr_bunbury$ from me to be kind enough not to have a relapse on saturday for i rely on you to arrange my music for me
it is my last reception and #one# wants something that will encourage conversation particularly at the end of the season when every #one# has practically said whatever they had to say which in most #case# was probably not much
i ll speak to $mr_bunbury$ aunt augusta if he is still conscious and i think i can promise you he ll be all right by saturday
$algernon_moncrieff$ of course the music is a great difficulty you see if #one# plays good music #people# dont listen and if #one# plays bad music #people# dont talk
but i ll run over the programme i ve drawn out if you will kindly come into the next #room# for a #moment#
$lady_bracknell$ thank you $algernon_moncrieff$ it is very thoughtful of you rising and following $algernon_moncrieff$ i sure the programme will be delightful after a few expurgations
#people# always seem to think that they are improper and either look shocked which is vulgar or laugh which is worse
french songs i cannot possibly allow but german sounds a thoroughly respectable language and indeed i believe is so $gwendolen$ you will accompany me
$gwendolen$ certainly mamma $lady_bracknell$ and $algernon_moncrieff$ go into the music #room# $gwendolen$ remains behind $uncle_jack$ charming #day# it has been miss fairfax
$gwendolen$ pray dont talk to me about the weather $mr_ernest_worthing$ whenever #people# talk to me about the weather i always feel quite certain that they mean something else
and that makes me so nervous $uncle_jack$ i do mean something else $gwendolen$ i thought so in #fact# i am never wrong
$uncle_jack$ and i would like to be allowed to take advantage of $lady_bracknell$ temporary absence $gwendolen$ i would certainly advise you to do so
mamma has a #way# of coming back suddenly into a #room# that i have often had to speak to her about
$uncle_jack$ nervously miss fairfax ever since i met you i have admired you more than any #girl# i have ever met since
i met you $gwendolen$ yes i am quite well aware of the #fact# and i often wish that in public at any rate you had been more demonstrative
for me you have always had an irresistible fascination even before i met you i was far from indifferent to you
the #fact# is constantly mentioned in the more expensive monthly magazines and has reached the provincial pulpits i am told and my ideal has always been to love some #one# of the #name# of $mr_ernest_worthing$
$uncle_jack$ looks at her in amazement we live as i hope you know $mr_ernest_worthing$ in an age of ideals there is something in that #name# that inspires absolute confidence
the #moment# $algernon_moncrieff$ first mentioned to me that he had a friend called $mr_ernest_worthing$ i knew i was destined to love you
$uncle_jack$ you really love me $gwendolen$ gwendolen passionately $uncle_jack$ darling you dont know how happy you ve made me $gwendolen$ my own $mr_ernest_worthing$
$uncle_jack$ but you dont really mean to say that you couldnt love me if my #name# wasnt $mr_ernest_worthing$ $gwendolen$ but your #name# is $mr_ernest_worthing$
$uncle_jack$ yes i know it is but supposing it was something else do you mean to say you couldnt love me then
ah that is clearly a metaphysical speculation and like most metaphysical speculations has very little reference at all to the actual #fact# of real #life# as we know them
$gwendolen$ glibly $uncle_jack$ personally darling to speak quite candidly i dont much care about the #name# of $mr_ernest_worthing$
i dont think the #name# suits me at all $gwendolen$ it suits you perfectly it is a divine #name# it has a music of its own
it produces vibrations $uncle_jack$ well really $gwendolen$ i must say that i think there are lots of other much nicer #name#
i think $uncle_jack$ for instance a charming #name# $gwendolen$ $uncle_jack$ no there is very little music in the #name# $uncle_jack$ if any at all indeed
it does not thrill it produces absolutely no vibrations i have known several jacks and they all without exception were more than usually plain
besides $uncle_jack$ is a notorious domesticity for john and i pity any #woman# who is married to a #man# called john
she would probably never be allowed to know the entrancing pleasure of a single #moment# solitude the only really safe #name# is $mr_ernest_worthing$
$uncle_jack$ $gwendolen$ i must get christened at once i mean we must get married at once there is no #time# to be lost
well surely you know that i love you and you led me to believe miss fairfax that you were not absolutely indifferent to me
$gwendolen$ married $mr_ernest_worthing$ $uncle_jack$ astounded $gwendolen$ i adore you but you havent proposed to me yet nothing has been said at all about marriage
the subject has not even been touched on $uncle_jack$ well may i propose to you now $gwendolen$ i think it would be an admirable opportunity
and to spare you any possible disappointment $mr_ernest_worthing$ i think it only fair to tell you quite frankly before #hand# that i am fully determined to accept you
$uncle_jack$ $gwendolen$ gwendolen yes $mr_ernest_worthing$ what have you got to say to me $uncle_jack$ you know what i have got to say to you
$gwendolen$ yes but you dont say it $uncle_jack$ $gwendolen$ will you marry me goes on his knees $gwendolen$ of course i will darling
how long you have been about it i am afraid you have had very little experience in how to propose $uncle_jack$
my own #one# i have never loved any #one# in the world but you $gwendolen$ yes but #man# often propose for practice
i know my #brother# gerald does all my #girl# friends tell me so what wonderfully blue eyes you have $mr_ernest_worthing$ they are quite quite blue
i hope you will always look at me just like that especially when there are other #people# present enter $lady_bracknell$
$lady_bracknell$ $mr_ernest_worthing$ rise #sir# from this semi recumbent posture it is most indecorous $gwendolen$ mamma he tries to rise she restrains him
i must beg you to retire this is no place for you besides $mr_ernest_worthing$ has not quite finished yet $lady_bracknell$
finished what may i ask $gwendolen$ i am engaged to $mr_ernest_worthing$ mamma they rise together $lady_bracknell$ pardon me you are not engaged to any #one#
when you do become engaged to some #one# i or your father should his health permit him will inform you of the #fact#
an engagement should come on a young #girl# as a surprise pleasant or unpleasant as the #case# may be it is hardly a matter that she could be allowed to arrange for herself
and now i have a few questions to put to you $mr_ernest_worthing$ while i am making these inquiries you $gwendolen$ will wait for me below in the carriage
$gwendolen$ reproachfully mamma $lady_bracknell$ in the carriage $gwendolen$ gwendolen goes to the door she and $uncle_jack$ blow kisses to each other behind $lady_bracknell$ back
$lady_bracknell$ looks vaguely about as if she could not understand what the noise was finally turns round $gwendolen$ the carriage
$gwendolen$ yes mamma goes out looking back at $uncle_jack$ $lady_bracknell$ sitting down you can take a seat $mr_ernest_worthing$ looks in her pocket for note book and pencil
i feel bound to tell you that you are not down on my list of eligible young #man# although i have the same list as the dear duchess of bolton has
$uncle_jack$ thank you $lady_bracknell$ i prefer standing $lady_bracknell$ pencil and note book in #hand# we #work# together in #fact# however i am quite ready to enter your #name# should your answers be what a really affectionate mother requires
do you smoke $uncle_jack$ well yes i must admit i smoke $lady_bracknell$ i am glad to hear it a #man# should always have an occupation of some kind
there are far too many idle #man# in london as it is how old are you $uncle_jack$ twenty nine $lady_bracknell$ a very good age to be married at
i have always been of opinion that a #man# who desires to get married should know either everything or nothing which do you know
$uncle_jack$ after some hesitation i know nothing $lady_bracknell$ lady bracknell i am pleased to hear it i do not approve of #anything# that tampers with natural ignorance
ignorance is like a delicate exotic fruit touch it and the bloom is gone the whole theory of modern education is radically unsound
if it did it would prove a serious danger to the upper classes and probably lead to acts of violence in grosvenor square
fortunately in england at any rate education produces no effect whatsoever what is your income $uncle_jack$ between seven and eight thousand a #year#
$lady_bracknell$ makes a note in her book in land or in investments $uncle_jack$ in investments chiefly $lady_bracknell$ that is satisfactory
what between the duties expected of #one# during #one# lifetime and the duties exacted from #one# after #one# death land has ceased to be either a profit or a pleasure
i have a #country# #house# with some land of course attached to it about fifteen hundred acres i believe but i dont depend on that for my real income
in #fact# as far as i can make out the poachers are the only #people# who make #anything# out of it
it gives #one# position and prevents #one# from keeping it up that all that can be said about land $uncle_jack$ $lady_bracknell$
a #country# #house# how many bedrooms well that point can be cleared up afterwards you have a #town# #house# i hope
a #girl# with a simple unspoiled nature like $gwendolen$ could hardly be expected to reside in the #country# $uncle_jack$ well i own a #house# in belgrave square but it is let by the #year# to lady bloxham
of course i can get it back whenever i like at six months notice $lady_bracknell$ lady bloxham i dont know her
$uncle_jack$ oh she goes about very little she is a lady considerably advanced in #year# $lady_bracknell$ ah nowadays that is no guarantee of respectability of character
what number in belgrave square $uncle_jack$ $lady_bracknell$ shaking her head the unfashionable side i thought there was something however that could easily be altered
$uncle_jack$ do you mean the fashion or the side $lady_bracknell$ sternly both if necessary i presume what are your politics
$uncle_jack$ well i am afraid i really have none i am a liberal unionist $lady_bracknell$ oh they count as tories
they dine with us or come in the evening at any rate now to minor matters are your parents living $uncle_jack$
i have lost both my parents $lady_bracknell$ to lose #one# parent $mr_ernest_worthing$ may be regarded as a misfortune to lose both looks like carelessness
was he born in what the radical papers call the purple of commerce or did he rise from the ranks of the aristocracy
who was your father he was evidently a #man# of some wealth $uncle_jack$ i am afraid i really dont know the #fact# is $lady_bracknell$ i said i had lost my parents
it would be nearer the truth to say that my parents seem to have lost me i dont actually know who i am by birth
the late mr thomas $miss_cecily_cardew$ an old gentleman of a very charitable and kindly disposition found me and gave me the #name# of $mr_ernest_worthing$ because he happened to have a first class ticket for $mr_ernest_worthing$ in his pocket at the #time#
i was well i was found $lady_bracknell$ found $uncle_jack$ $mr_ernest_worthing$ is a place in sussex it is a seaside resort
$lady_bracknell$ where did the charitable gentleman who had a first class ticket for this seaside resort find you $uncle_jack$ gravely in a #hand# #bag#
$lady_bracknell$ a #hand# #bag# $uncle_jack$ very seriously yes $lady_bracknell$ i was in a #hand# #bag# a somewhat large black leather #hand# #bag# with handles to it an ordinary #hand# #bag# in #fact#
$lady_bracknell$ in what locality did this mr james or thomas $miss_cecily_cardew$ come across this ordinary #hand# #bag# $uncle_jack$ in the cloak #room# at victoria station
it was given to him in mistake for his own $lady_bracknell$ the cloak #room# at victoria station $uncle_jack$ yes the brighton line
$lady_bracknell$ the line is immaterial $mr_ernest_worthing$ i confess i feel somewhat bewildered by what you have just told me
to be born or at any rate bred in a #hand# #bag# whether it had handles or not seems to me to display a contempt for the ordinary decencies of family #life# that reminds #one# of the worst excesses of the french revolution
as for the particular locality in which the #hand# #bag# was found a cloak #room# at a railway station might serve to conceal a social indiscretion has probably indeed been used for that purpose before now but it could hardly be regarded as an assured basis for a recognised position in good society
and i presume you know what that unfortunate movement led to $uncle_jack$ may i ask you then what you would advise me to do
i would strongly advise you $mr_ernest_worthing$ to try and acquire some relations as soon as possible and to make a definite effort to produce at any rate #one# parent of either sex before the season is quite over
i need hardly say i would do #anything# in the world to ensure $gwendolen$ happiness $lady_bracknell$ $uncle_jack$ well i dont see how i could possibly manage to do that
i can produce the #hand# #bag# at any #moment# it is in my dressing #room# at home i really think that should satisfy you $lady_bracknell$
you can hardly imagine that i and lord bracknell would dream of allowing our only daughter a #girl# brought up with the utmost care to marry into a cloak #room# and form an alliance with a parcel
$lady_bracknell$ me #sir# what has it to do with me good morning $mr_ernest_worthing$ $lady_bracknell$ sweeps out in majestic indignation
$uncle_jack$ good morning $algernon_moncrieff$ from the other #room# strikes up the wedding march $uncle_jack$ looks perfectly furious and goes to the door
for goodness sake dont play that ghastly tune algy how idiotic you are the music stops and $algernon_moncrieff$ enters cheerily $algernon_moncrieff$
didnt it go off all right old boy you dont mean to say $gwendolen$ refused you i know it is a #way# she has
she is always refusing #people# i think it is most ill natured of her $uncle_jack$ oh $gwendolen$ is as right as a trivet
as far as she is concerned we are engaged her mother is perfectly unbearable never met such a gorgon
i dont really know what a gorgon is like but i am quite sure that $lady_bracknell$ is #one# in any #case# she is a monster without being a myth which is rather unfair
i beg your pardon algy i suppose i shouldnt talk about your own aunt in that #way# before you $algernon_moncrieff$ my dear boy i love hearing my relations abused
relations are simply a tedious pack of #people# who havent got the remotest knowledge of how to live nor the smallest instinct about when to die
it is the only #thing# that makes me put up with them at all $uncle_jack$ oh that is nonsense $algernon_moncrieff$ it isnt
$uncle_jack$ well i wont argue about the matter you always want to argue about #thing# $algernon_moncrieff$ that is exactly what #thing# were originally made for
you dont think there is any chance of $gwendolen$ becoming like her mother in about a hundred and fifty #year# do you algy
$uncle_jack$ upon my word if i thought that i shoot myself a pause $algernon_moncrieff$ all #woman# become like their mothers
that is their tragedy no #man# does that his $uncle_jack$ is that clever $algernon_moncrieff$ it is perfectly phrased and quite as true as any observation in civilised #life# should be
$uncle_jack$ i am sick to death of cleverness everybody is clever nowadays you cant go anywhere without meeting clever #people# the #thing# has become an absolute public nuisance
i wish to goodness we had a few fools left $algernon_moncrieff$ we have $uncle_jack$ i should extremely like to meet them
what do they talk about $algernon_moncrieff$ the fools oh about the clever #people# of course $uncle_jack$ what fools $algernon_moncrieff$ by the #way# did you tell $gwendolen$ the truth about your being $mr_ernest_worthing$ in #town# and $uncle_jack$ in the #country#
$uncle_jack$ in a very patronising manner my dear fellow the truth isnt quite the sort of #thing# #one# tells to a nice sweet refined #girl#
the only #way# to behave to a #woman# is to make love to her if she is pretty and to some #one# else if she is plain
what extraordinary ideas you have about the #way# to behave to a #woman# $algernon_moncrieff$ $uncle_jack$ oh that is nonsense $algernon_moncrieff$ what about your #brother#
what about the profligate $mr_ernest_worthing$ $uncle_jack$ oh before the end of the week i shall have got rid of him i ll say he died in paris of apoplexy
lots of #people# die of apoplexy quite suddenly dont they $algernon_moncrieff$ yes but it hereditary my dear fellow it a sort of #thing# that runs in families
you had much better say a severe chill $uncle_jack$ you are sure a severe chill isnt hereditary or #anything# of that kind
$algernon_moncrieff$ of course it isnt $uncle_jack$ very well then my poor #brother# $mr_ernest_worthing$ to carried off suddenly in paris by a severe chill
that gets rid of him $algernon_moncrieff$ but i thought you said that $miss_cecily_cardew$ was a little too much interested in your poor #brother# $mr_ernest_worthing$
wont she feel his loss a good deal $uncle_jack$ oh that is all right $miss_cecily_cardew$ is not a silly romantic #girl# i am glad to say
she has got a capital appetite goes long walks and pays no attention at all to her lessons $algernon_moncrieff$ i would rather like to see $miss_cecily_cardew$
$uncle_jack$ i will take very good care you never do she is excessively pretty and she is only just eighteen $algernon_moncrieff$
have you told $gwendolen$ yet that you have an excessively pretty ward who is only just eighteen $uncle_jack$ oh #one# doesnt blurt these #thing# out to #people#
i ll bet you #anything# you like that half an hour after they have met they will be calling each other sister
$miss_cecily_cardew$ and $gwendolen$ are perfectly certain to be extremely great friends $algernon_moncrieff$ #woman# only do that when they have called each other a lot of other #thing# first
now my dear boy if we want to get a good table at willis we really must go and dress do you know it is nearly seven
$uncle_jack$ irritably oh it always is nearly seven $algernon_moncrieff$ well i hungry $uncle_jack$ i never knew you when you werent
$algernon_moncrieff$ what shall we do after dinner go to a theatre $uncle_jack$ oh no i loathe listening $algernon_moncrieff$ well let us go to the club
$uncle_jack$ oh no i hate talking $algernon_moncrieff$ well we might trot round to the empire at ten $uncle_jack$ oh no i cant bear looking at #thing#
it is so silly $algernon_moncrieff$ well what shall we do $uncle_jack$ nothing $algernon_moncrieff$ it is awfully hard #work# doing nothing however i dont mind hard #work# where there is no definite object of any kind
enter $lane$ lane miss fairfax enter $gwendolen$ $lane$ goes out $algernon_moncrieff$ $gwendolen$ upon my word $gwendolen$ algy kindly turn your back
i have something very particular to say to $mr_ernest_worthing$ $algernon_moncrieff$ really $gwendolen$ i dont think i can allow this at all
$gwendolen$ algy you always adopt a strictly immoral attitude towards #life# you are not quite old enough to do that $algernon_moncrieff$ retires to the fireplace
$uncle_jack$ my own darling $gwendolen$ $mr_ernest_worthing$ we may never be married from the expression on mamma face i fear we never shall
few parents nowadays pay any regard to what their children say to them the old fashioned respect for the young is fast dying out
but although she may prevent us from becoming #man# and wife and i may marry some #one# else and marry often nothing that she can possibly do can alter my eternal devotion to you
the story of your romantic origin as related to me by mamma with unpleasing comments has naturally stirred the deeper fibres of my nature
whatever influence i ever had over mamma i lost at the age of three $uncle_jack$ dear $gwendolen$ gwendolen your christian #name# has an irresistible fascination
the simplicity of your character makes you exquisitely incomprehensible to me your #town# address at the albany i have what is your address in the #country#
$uncle_jack$ the manor #house# woolton hertfordshire $algernon_moncrieff$ who has been carefully listening smiles to himself and writes the address on his shirt cuff
then picks up the railway guide $gwendolen$ there is a good postal service i suppose it may be necessary to do something desperate
that of course will require serious consideration i will communicate with you daily $uncle_jack$ my own #one# $gwendolen$ how long do you remain in #town#
$uncle_jack$ till monday $gwendolen$ good algy you may turn round now $algernon_moncrieff$ thanks i ve turned round already $gwendolen$ you may also ring the bell
$uncle_jack$ you will let me see you to your carriage my own darling $gwendolen$ certainly $uncle_jack$ to $lane$ who now enters
i will see miss fairfax out $lane$ yes #sir# $uncle_jack$ and $gwendolen$ go off $lane$ presents several letters on a salver to $algernon_moncrieff$
it is to be surmised that they are bills as $algernon_moncrieff$ after looking at the envelopes tears them up $algernon_moncrieff$ a glass of sherry $lane$
$lane$ yes #sir# $algernon_moncrieff$ to morrow $lane$ i going bunburying $lane$ yes #sir# $algernon_moncrieff$ i shall probably not be back till monday
you can put up my dress clothes my smoking jacket and all the $mr_bunbury$ suits $lane$ yes #sir#
handing sherry $algernon_moncrieff$ i hope to morrow will be a fine #day# $lane$ lane it never is #sir# $algernon_moncrieff$ $lane$ you re a perfect pessimist
$lane$ i do my best to give satisfaction #sir# enter $uncle_jack$ $lane$ goes off $uncle_jack$ there a sensible intellectual #girl# the only #girl# i ever cared for in my #life#
$algernon_moncrieff$ is laughing immoderately what on earth are you so amused at $algernon_moncrieff$ oh i a little anxious about poor $mr_bunbury$ that is all
$uncle_jack$ if you dont take care your friend $mr_bunbury$ will get you into a serious scrape some #day# $algernon_moncrieff$ i love scrapes
they are the only #thing# that are never serious $uncle_jack$ oh that nonsense algy you never talk #anything# but nonsense $algernon_moncrieff$
nobody ever does $uncle_jack$ looks indignantly at him and leaves the #room# $algernon_moncrieff$ lights a cigarette reads his shirt cuff and smiles
act drop second act scene garden at the manor #house# a flight of grey stone steps leads up to the #house#
the garden an old fashioned #one# full of roses #time# of #year# july basket chairs and a table covered with books are set under a large yew tree
miss prism discovered seated at the table $miss_cecily_cardew$ is at the back watering flowers miss prism calling $miss_cecily_cardew$ cecily surely such a utilitarian occupation as the watering of flowers is rather moulton duty than yours
especially at a #moment# when intellectual pleasures await you your german grammar is on the table pray open it at page fifteen
we will repeat yesterday lesson $miss_cecily_cardew$ coming over very slowly but i dont like german it isnt at all a becoming language
i know perfectly well that i look quite plain after my german lesson miss prism child you know how anxious your guardian is that you should improve yourself in every #way#
he laid particular stress on your german as he was leaving for #town# yesterday indeed he always lays stress on your german when he is leaving for #town#
$miss_cecily_cardew$ dear $uncle_jack$ is so very serious sometimes he is so serious that i think he cannot be quite well
your guardian enjoys the best of health and his gravity of demeanour is especially to be commended in #one# so comparatively young as he is
miss prism drawing herself up i know no #one# who has a higher sense of duty and responsibility $miss_cecily_cardew$ i suppose that is why he often looks a little bored when we three are together
miss prism $miss_cecily_cardew$ i am surprised at you $mr_ernest_worthing$ has many troubles in his #life# idle merriment and triviality would be out of place in his conversation
you must remember his constant anxiety about that unfortunate young #man# his #brother# $miss_cecily_cardew$ i wish $uncle_jack$ would allow that unfortunate young #man# his #brother# to come down here sometimes
we might have a good influence over him miss prism i am sure you certainly would you know german and geology and #thing# of that kind influence a #man# very much
i do not think that even i could produce any effect on a character that according to his own #brother# admission is irretrievably weak and vacillating
$miss_cecily_cardew$ begins to write in her diary miss prism shaking her head indeed i am not sure that i would desire to reclaim him
i am not in favour of this modern mania for turning bad #people# into good #people# at a #moment# notice as a #man# sows so let him reap
you must put away your diary $miss_cecily_cardew$ i really dont see why you should keep a diary at all $miss_cecily_cardew$ i keep a diary in order to enter the wonderful secrets of my #life#
if i didnt write them down i should probably forget all about them miss prism memory my dear $miss_cecily_cardew$ is the diary that we all carry about with us
$miss_cecily_cardew$ yes but it usually chronicles the #thing# that have never happened and couldnt possibly have happened i believe that memory is responsible for nearly all the three volume novels that mudie sends us
miss prism do not speak slightingly of the three volume novel $miss_cecily_cardew$ i wrote #one# myself in earlier #day# $miss_cecily_cardew$ did you really miss prism
how wonderfully clever you are i hope it did not end happily i dont like novels that end happily they depress me so much
miss prism the good ended happily and the bad unhappily that is what fiction means $miss_cecily_cardew$ i suppose so but it seems very unfair
and was your novel ever published miss prism alas no the manuscript unfortunately was abandoned $miss_cecily_cardew$ starts i use the word in the sense of lost or mislaid
to your #work# child these speculations are profitless $miss_cecily_cardew$ smiling but i see dear $dr_chasuble$ coming up through the garden
miss prism rising and advancing $dr_chasuble$ this is indeed a pleasure enter canon chasuble chasuble and how are we this morning
i think it would do her so much good to have a short stroll with you in the park $dr_chasuble$
miss prism you are i trust well $miss_cecily_cardew$ miss prism has just been complaining of a slight headache miss prism $miss_cecily_cardew$ i have not mentioned #anything# about a headache
$miss_cecily_cardew$ no dear miss prism i know that but i felt instinctively that you had a headache indeed i was thinking about that and not about my german lesson when the rector came in
chasuble i hope $miss_cecily_cardew$ you are not inattentive $miss_cecily_cardew$ oh i am afraid i am chasuble that is strange were i fortunate enough to be miss prism pupil i would hang upon her lips
miss prism glares i spoke metaphorically my metaphor was drawn from bees ahem $mr_ernest_worthing$ i suppose has not returned from #town# yet
miss prism we do not expect him till monday afternoon chasuble ah yes he usually likes to spend his sunday in london
he is not #one# of those whose sole aim is enjoyment as by all accounts that unfortunate young #man# his #brother# seems to be
but i must not disturb egeria and her pupil any longer miss prism egeria my #name# is laetitia doctor chasuble bowing
a classical allusion merely drawn from the pagan authors i shall see you both no doubt at evensong miss prism i think dear doctor i will have a stroll with you
i find i have a headache after all and a walk might do it good chasuble with pleasure miss prism with pleasure
we might go as far as the schools and back miss prism that would be delightful $miss_cecily_cardew$ you will read your political economy in my absence
the chapter on the fall of the rupee you may omit it is somewhat too sensational even these metallic problems have their melodramatic side
goes down the garden with $dr_chasuble$ $miss_cecily_cardew$ picks up books and throws them back on table horrid political economy horrid geography
horrid horrid german enter $merriman$ with a card on a salver $merriman$ $mr_ernest_worthing$ has just driven over from the station
he has brought his luggage with him $miss_cecily_cardew$ takes the card and reads it $mr_ernest_worthing$ the albany $uncle_jack$ #brother#
did you tell him $mr_ernest_worthing$ was in #town# $merriman$ yes miss he seemed very much disappointed i mentioned that you and miss prism were in the garden
he said he was anxious to speak to you privately for a #moment# $miss_cecily_cardew$ ask $mr_ernest_worthing$ to come here
i suppose you had better talk to the housekeeper about a #room# for him $merriman$ yes miss $merriman$ goes off $miss_cecily_cardew$
i have never met any really wicked person before i feel rather frightened i am so afraid he will look just like every #one# else
enter $algernon_moncrieff$ very gay and debonnair he does $algernon_moncrieff$ raising his hat you are my little cousin $miss_cecily_cardew$ i sure $miss_cecily_cardew$
you are under some strange mistake i am not little in #fact# i believe i am more than usually tall for my age
$algernon_moncrieff$ is rather taken aback but i am your cousin $miss_cecily_cardew$ you i see from your card are $uncle_jack$ #brother# my cousin $mr_ernest_worthing$ my wicked cousin $mr_ernest_worthing$
$algernon_moncrieff$ oh i am not really wicked at all cousin $miss_cecily_cardew$ you mustnt think that i am wicked $miss_cecily_cardew$ if you are not then you have certainly been deceiving us all in a very inexcusable manner
i hope you have not been leading a double #life# pretending to be wicked and being really good all the #time#
that would be hypocrisy $algernon_moncrieff$ looks at her in amazement oh of course i have been rather reckless $miss_cecily_cardew$ i am glad to hear it
$algernon_moncrieff$ in #fact# now you mention the subject i have been very bad in my own small #way# $miss_cecily_cardew$ i dont think you should be so proud of that though i am sure it must have been very pleasant
$algernon_moncrieff$ it is much pleasanter being here with you $miss_cecily_cardew$ i cant understand how you are here at all $uncle_jack$ wont be back till monday afternoon
$algernon_moncrieff$ that is a great disappointment i am obliged to go up by the first train on monday morning i have a business appointment that i am anxious
to miss $miss_cecily_cardew$ couldnt you miss it anywhere but in london $algernon_moncrieff$ no the appointment is in london $miss_cecily_cardew$
well i know of course how important it is not to keep a business engagement if #one# wants to retain any sense of the beauty of #life# but still i think you had better wait till $uncle_jack$ arrives
i know he wants to speak to you about your emigrating $algernon_moncrieff$ about my what $miss_cecily_cardew$ your emigrating he has gone up to buy your outfit
$algernon_moncrieff$ i certainly wouldnt let $uncle_jack$ buy my outfit he has no taste in neckties at all $miss_cecily_cardew$ i dont think you will require neckties
well he said at dinner on wednesday night that you would have to choose between this world the next world and australia
$uncle_jack$ is sending you to australia $algernon_moncrieff$ australia i sooner die $miss_cecily_cardew$ $algernon_moncrieff$ oh well the accounts i have received of australia and the next world are not particularly encouraging
this world is good enough for me cousin $miss_cecily_cardew$ cecily yes but are you good enough for it $algernon_moncrieff$ i afraid i not that
that is why i want you to reform me you might make that your mission if you dont mind cousin $miss_cecily_cardew$
$miss_cecily_cardew$ i afraid i ve no #time# this afternoon $algernon_moncrieff$ well would you mind my reforming myself this afternoon $miss_cecily_cardew$ it is rather quixotic of you
but i think you should try $algernon_moncrieff$ i will i feel better already $miss_cecily_cardew$ you are looking a little worse $algernon_moncrieff$
i should have remembered that when #one# is going to lead an entirely new #life# #one# requires regular and wholesome meals
that is because i am hungry $miss_cecily_cardew$ how thoughtless of me wont you come in $algernon_moncrieff$ thank you might i have a buttonhole first
i never have any appetite unless i have a buttonhole first $miss_cecily_cardew$ a marechal niel picks up scissors $algernon_moncrieff$ no i sooner have a pink rose
$miss_cecily_cardew$ why cuts a flower $algernon_moncrieff$ because you are like a pink rose cousin $miss_cecily_cardew$ cecily i dont think it can be right for you to talk to me like that
miss prism never says such #thing# to me $algernon_moncrieff$ then miss prism is a short sighted old lady $miss_cecily_cardew$ puts the rose in his buttonhole
you are the prettiest #girl# i ever saw $miss_cecily_cardew$ miss prism says that all good looks are a snare $algernon_moncrieff$ they are a snare that every sensible #man# would like to be caught in
$miss_cecily_cardew$ oh i dont think i would care to catch a sensible #man# i shouldnt know what to talk to him about
they pass into the #house# miss prism and $dr_chasuble$ return miss prism you are too much alone dear $dr_chasuble$
you should get married a misanthrope i can understand a womanthrope never chasuble with a scholar shudder believe me i do not deserve so neologistic a phrase
the precept as well as the practice of the primitive church was distinctly against matrimony miss prism sententiously that is obviously the reason why the primitive church has not lasted up to the present #day#
and you do not seem to realise dear doctor that by persistently remaining single a #man# converts himself into a permanent public temptation
#man# should be more careful this very celibacy leads weaker vessels astray chasuble but is a #man# not equally attractive when married
miss prism no married #man# is ever attractive except to his wife chasuble and often i ve been told not even to her
miss prism that depends on the intellectual sympathies of the #woman# maturity can always be depended on ripeness can be trusted
young #woman# are green $dr_chasuble$ starts i spoke horticulturally my metaphor was drawn from fruits but where is $miss_cecily_cardew$ chasuble
perhaps she followed us to the schools enter $uncle_jack$ slowly from the back of the garden he is dressed in the deepest mourning with crape hatband and black gloves
miss prism $mr_ernest_worthing$ chasuble $mr_ernest_worthing$ miss prism this is indeed a surprise we did not look for you till monday afternoon
$uncle_jack$ shakes miss prism #hand# in a tragic manner i have returned sooner than i expected $dr_chasuble$ i hope you are well
chasuble dear $mr_ernest_worthing$ i trust this garb of woe does not betoken some terrible calamity $uncle_jack$ my #brother# miss prism
more shameful debts and extravagance chasuble still leading his #life# of pleasure $uncle_jack$ shaking his head dead chasuble your #brother# $mr_ernest_worthing$ dead
$uncle_jack$ quite dead miss prism what a lesson for him i trust he will profit by it chasuble $mr_ernest_worthing$ i offer you my sincere condolence
you have at least the consolation of knowing that you were always the most generous and forgiving of #brother# $uncle_jack$ poor $mr_ernest_worthing$
he had many faults but it is a sad sad blow chasuble very sad indeed were you with him at the end
$uncle_jack$ no he died abroad in paris in #fact# i had a telegram last night from the manager of the grand hotel
chasuble was the cause of death mentioned $uncle_jack$ a severe chill it seems miss prism as a #man# sows so shall he reap
chasuble raising his #hand# charity dear miss prism charity none of us are perfect i myself am peculiarly susceptible to draughts
will the interment take place here $uncle_jack$ no he seems to have expressed a desire to be buried in paris chasuble
in paris shakes his head i fear that hardly points to any very serious state of mind at the last you would no doubt wish me to make some slight allusion to this tragic domestic affliction next sunday
my sermon on the meaning of the manna in the wilderness can be adapted to almost any occasion joyful or as in the present #case# distressing
$uncle_jack$ presses his #hand# convulsively all sigh i have preached it at harvest celebrations christenings confirmations on #day# of humiliation and festal #day#
the last #time# i delivered it was in the cathedral as a charity sermon on behalf of the society for the prevention of discontent among the upper orders
the bishop who was present was much struck by some of the analogies i drew $uncle_jack$ ah that reminds me you mentioned christenings i think $dr_chasuble$
i suppose you know how to christen all right $dr_chasuble$ looks astounded i mean of course you are continually christening arent you
miss prism it is i regret to say #one# of the rector most constant duties in this parish i have often spoken to the poorer classes on the subject
but they dont seem to know what thrift is chasuble but is there any particular infant in whom you are interested $mr_ernest_worthing$
your #brother# was i believe unmarried was he not $uncle_jack$ oh yes miss prism bitterly #people# who live entirely for pleasure usually are
$uncle_jack$ but it is not for any child dear doctor i am very fond of children no the #fact# is i would like to be christened myself this afternoon if you have nothing better to do
chasuble but surely $mr_ernest_worthing$ you have been christened already $uncle_jack$ i dont remember #anything# about it chasuble but have you any grave doubts on the subject
of course i dont know if the #thing# would bother you in any #way# or if you think i am a little too old now
$uncle_jack$ i certainly intend to have chasuble not at all the sprinkling and indeed the immersion of adults is a perfectly canonical practice
$uncle_jack$ immersion chasuble you need have no apprehensions sprinkling is all that is necessary or indeed i think advisable our weather is so changeable
at what hour would you wish the ceremony performed $uncle_jack$ oh i might trot round about five if that would suit you
chasuble perfectly perfectly in #fact# i have two similar ceremonies to perform at that #time# a #case# of twins that occurred recently in #one# of the outlying cottages on your own estate
poor jenkins the carter a most hard working #man# $uncle_jack$ oh i dont see much fun in being christened along with other babies
it would be childish would half past five do chasuble admirably admirably takes out watch and now dear $mr_ernest_worthing$ i will not intrude any longer into a #house# of sorrow
i would merely beg you not to be too much bowed down by grief what seem to us bitter trials are often blessings in disguise
miss prism this seems to me a blessing of an extremely obvious kind enter $miss_cecily_cardew$ from the #house# $miss_cecily_cardew$ $uncle_jack$
oh i am pleased to see you back but what horrid clothes you have got on do go and change them
miss prism $miss_cecily_cardew$ chasuble my child my child $miss_cecily_cardew$ goes towards $uncle_jack$ he kisses her brow in a melancholy manner $miss_cecily_cardew$
what is the matter $uncle_jack$ do look happy you look as if you had toothache and i have got such a surprise for you
who do you think is in the dining #room# your #brother# $uncle_jack$ who $miss_cecily_cardew$ your #brother# $mr_ernest_worthing$ he arrived about half an hour ago
$uncle_jack$ what nonsense i havent got a #brother# $miss_cecily_cardew$ oh dont say that however badly he may have behaved to you in the past he is still your #brother#
you couldnt be so heartless as to disown him i ll tell him to come out and you will shake #hand# with him wont you $uncle_jack$
runs back into the #house# chasuble these are very joyful tidings miss prism after we had all been resigned to his loss his sudden return seems to me peculiarly distressing
$uncle_jack$ my #brother# is in the dining #room# i dont know what it all means i think it is perfectly absurd enter $algernon_moncrieff$ and $miss_cecily_cardew$ #hand# in #hand#
#brother# john i have come down from #town# to tell you that i am very sorry for all the trouble i have given you and that i intend to lead a better #life# in the future
they come slowly up to $uncle_jack$ jack good heavens motions $algernon_moncrieff$ away $algernon_moncrieff$ $uncle_jack$ glares at him and does not take his #hand#
$miss_cecily_cardew$ $uncle_jack$ you are not going to refuse your own #brother# #hand# $uncle_jack$ nothing will induce me to take his #hand#
i think his coming down here disgraceful he knows perfectly well why $miss_cecily_cardew$ $uncle_jack$ do be nice there is some good in every #one#
and surely there must be much good in #one# who is kind to an invalid and leaves the pleasures of london to sit by a bed of pain
$mr_ernest_worthing$ has just been telling me about his poor invalid friend $mr_bunbury$ whom he goes to visit so often $uncle_jack$
oh he has been talking about $mr_bunbury$ has he $miss_cecily_cardew$ yes he has told me all about poor $mr_bunbury$ and his terrible state of health
$uncle_jack$ $mr_bunbury$ well i wont have him talk to you about $mr_bunbury$ or about #anything# else it is enough to drive #one# perfectly frantic
$algernon_moncrieff$ of course i admit that the faults were all on my side but i must say that i think that #brother# john coldness to me is peculiarly painful
i expected a more enthusiastic welcome especially considering it is the first #time# i have come here $miss_cecily_cardew$ $uncle_jack$ if you dont shake #hand# with $mr_ernest_worthing$ i will never forgive you
$uncle_jack$ never forgive me $miss_cecily_cardew$ never never never $uncle_jack$ well this is the last #time# i shall ever do it shakes with $algernon_moncrieff$ and glares
chasuble it pleasant is it not to see so perfect a reconciliation i think we might leave the two #brother# together
miss prism $miss_cecily_cardew$ you will come with us $miss_cecily_cardew$ certainly miss prism my little task of reconciliation is over chasuble you have done a beautiful action to #day# dear child
miss prism we must not be premature in our judgments $miss_cecily_cardew$ i feel very happy they all go off except $uncle_jack$ and $algernon_moncrieff$
$uncle_jack$ you young scoundrel algy you must get out of this place as soon as possible i dont allow any bunburying here
enter $merriman$ merriman i have put $mr_ernest_worthing$ #thing# in the #room# next to yours #sir# i suppose that is all right
$uncle_jack$ what $merriman$ $mr_ernest_worthing$ luggage #sir# i have unpacked it and put it in the #room# next to your own
$uncle_jack$ his luggage $merriman$ yes #sir# three portmanteaus a dressing #case# two hat boxes and a large luncheon basket $algernon_moncrieff$ i am afraid i cant stay more than a week this #time#
$uncle_jack$ $merriman$ order the dog cart at once $mr_ernest_worthing$ has been suddenly called back to #town# $merriman$ yes #sir# goes back into the #house#
$algernon_moncrieff$ what a fearful liar you are $uncle_jack$ i have not been called back to #town# at all $uncle_jack$ yes you have
$algernon_moncrieff$ i havent heard any #one# call me $uncle_jack$ your duty as a gentleman calls you back $algernon_moncrieff$ my duty as a gentleman has never interfered with my pleasures in the smallest degree
$uncle_jack$ i can quite understand that $algernon_moncrieff$ well $miss_cecily_cardew$ is a darling $uncle_jack$ you are not to talk of $miss_cecily_cardew$ like that
i dont like it $algernon_moncrieff$ well i dont like your clothes you look perfectly ridiculous in them why on earth dont you go up and change
it is perfectly childish to be in deep mourning for a #man# who is actually staying for a whole week with you in your #house# as a guest
i call it grotesque $uncle_jack$ you are certainly not staying with me for a whole week as a guest or #anything# else
you have got to leave by the four five train $algernon_moncrieff$ i certainly wont leave you so long as you are in mourning
it would be most unfriendly if i were in mourning you would stay with me i suppose i should think it very unkind if you didnt
$uncle_jack$ well will you go if i change my clothes $algernon_moncrieff$ yes if you are not too long i never saw anybody take so long to dress and with such little result
$uncle_jack$ well at any rate that is better than being always over dressed as you are $algernon_moncrieff$ if i am occasionally a little over dressed i make up for it by being always immensely over educated
$uncle_jack$ your vanity is ridiculous your conduct an outrage and your presence in my garden utterly absurd however you have got to catch the four five and i hope you will have a pleasant journey back to #town#
this bunburying as you call it has not been a great success for you goes into the #house# $algernon_moncrieff$ i think it has been a great success
i in love with $miss_cecily_cardew$ and that is everything enter $miss_cecily_cardew$ at the back of the garden she picks up the can and begins to water the flowers
but i must see her before i go and make arrangements for another $mr_bunbury$ ah there she is $miss_cecily_cardew$ oh i merely came back to water the roses
i thought you were with $uncle_jack$ $algernon_moncrieff$ he gone to order the dog cart for me $miss_cecily_cardew$ oh is he going to take you for a nice drive
$algernon_moncrieff$ he going to send me away $miss_cecily_cardew$ then have we got to part $algernon_moncrieff$ i am afraid so it a very painful parting
$miss_cecily_cardew$ it is always painful to part from #people# whom #one# has known for a very brief space of #time# the absence of old friends #one# can endure with equanimity
but even a momentary separation from anyone to whom #one# has just been introduced is almost unbearable $algernon_moncrieff$ thank you enter $merriman$
$merriman$ the dog cart is at the door #sir# $algernon_moncrieff$ looks appealingly at $miss_cecily_cardew$ cecily it can wait $merriman$ for
i hope $miss_cecily_cardew$ i shall not offend you if i state quite frankly and openly that you seem to me to be in every #way# the visible personification of absolute perfection
five minutes $merriman$ yes miss exit $merriman$ $algernon_moncrieff$ $miss_cecily_cardew$ i think your frankness does you great credit $mr_ernest_worthing$ if you will allow me i will copy your remarks into my diary
goes over to table and begins writing in diary $algernon_moncrieff$ do you really keep a diary i give #anything# to look at it
you see it is simply a very young #girl# record of her own thoughts and impressions and consequently meant for publication
may i $miss_cecily_cardew$ oh no puts her #hand# over it when it appears in volume form i hope you will order a copy
but pray $mr_ernest_worthing$ dont stop i delight in taking down from dictation i have reached absolute perfection you can go on
i am quite ready for more $algernon_moncrieff$ somewhat taken aback ahem ahem $miss_cecily_cardew$ oh dont cough $mr_ernest_worthing$ when #one# is dictating #one# should speak fluently and not cough
$miss_cecily_cardew$ ever since i first looked upon your wonderful and incomparable beauty i have dared to love you wildly passionately devotedly hopelessly
besides i dont know how to spell a cough writes as $algernon_moncrieff$ speaks $algernon_moncrieff$ speaking very rapidly $miss_cecily_cardew$ i dont think that you should tell me that you love me wildly passionately devotedly hopelessly
hopelessly doesnt seem to make much sense does it $algernon_moncrieff$ $miss_cecily_cardew$ enter $merriman$ merriman the dog cart is waiting #sir# $algernon_moncrieff$ tell it to come round next week at the same hour
$uncle_jack$ would be very much annoyed if he knew you were staying on till next week at the same hour
$merriman$ looks at $miss_cecily_cardew$ who makes no sign yes #sir# $merriman$ retires $miss_cecily_cardew$ $algernon_moncrieff$ oh i dont care about $uncle_jack$ i dont care for anybody in the whole world but you
i love you $miss_cecily_cardew$ you will marry me wont you $miss_cecily_cardew$ you silly boy of course why we have been engaged for the last three months
$algernon_moncrieff$ for the last three months $miss_cecily_cardew$ yes it will be exactly three months on thursday $algernon_moncrieff$ but how did we become engaged
well ever since dear $uncle_jack$ first confessed to us that he had a younger #brother# who was very wicked and bad
$miss_cecily_cardew$ you of course have formed the chief topic of conversation between myself and miss prism and of course a #man# who is much talked about is always very attractive
#one# feels there must be something in him after all i daresay it was foolish of me but i fell in love with you $mr_ernest_worthing$
worn out by your entire ignorance of my existence i determined to end the matter #one# #way# or the other and after a long struggle with myself i accepted you under this dear old tree here
the next #day# i bought this little ring in your #name# and this is the little bangle with the true lover knot
$algernon_moncrieff$ darling and when was the engagement actually settled $miss_cecily_cardew$ on the th of february last i promised you always to wear
$algernon_moncrieff$ did i give you this it very pretty isnt it $miss_cecily_cardew$ yes you ve wonderfully good taste $mr_ernest_worthing$ it the excuse i ve always given for your leading such a bad #life#
and this is the box in which i keep all your dear letters kneels at table opens box and produces letters tied up with blue ribbon
$algernon_moncrieff$ my letters but my own sweet $miss_cecily_cardew$ i have never written you any letters $miss_cecily_cardew$ you need hardly remind me of that $mr_ernest_worthing$
i remember only too well that i was forced to write your letters for you i wrote always three #time# a week and sometimes oftener
$algernon_moncrieff$ oh do let me read them $miss_cecily_cardew$ cecily oh i couldnt possibly they would make you far too conceited replaces box
the three you wrote me after i had broken off the engagement are so beautiful and so badly spelled that even now i can hardly read them without crying a little
$algernon_moncrieff$ but was our engagement ever broken off $miss_cecily_cardew$ of course it was on the nd of last march you can see the entry if you like
shows diary to #day# i broke off my engagement with $mr_ernest_worthing$ i feel it is better to do so the weather still continues charming
$algernon_moncrieff$ but why on earth did you break it off what had i done i had done nothing at all $miss_cecily_cardew$ i am very much hurt indeed to hear you broke it off
particularly when the weather was so charming $miss_cecily_cardew$ it would hardly have been a really serious engagement if it hadnt been broken off at least once
but i forgave you before the week was out $algernon_moncrieff$ crossing to her and kneeling what a perfect angel you are $miss_cecily_cardew$
$miss_cecily_cardew$ you dear romantic boy he kisses her she puts her fingers through his hair i hope your hair curls naturally does it
$algernon_moncrieff$ yes darling with a little help from others $miss_cecily_cardew$ i am so glad $algernon_moncrieff$ you ll never break off our engagement again $miss_cecily_cardew$
$miss_cecily_cardew$ i dont think i could break it off now that i have actually met you besides of course there is the question of your #name#
you must not laugh at me darling but it had always been a girlish dream of mine to love some #one# whose #name# was $mr_ernest_worthing$
$algernon_moncrieff$ yes of course nervously $miss_cecily_cardew$ $algernon_moncrieff$ rises $miss_cecily_cardew$ also there is something in that #name# that seems to inspire absolute confidence
i pity any poor married #woman# whose husband is not called $mr_ernest_worthing$ $algernon_moncrieff$ but my dear child do you mean to say you could not love me if i had some other #name#
$miss_cecily_cardew$ but what #name# $algernon_moncrieff$ oh any #name# you like $algernon_moncrieff$ for instance $miss_cecily_cardew$ but i dont like the #name# of $algernon_moncrieff$
well my own dear sweet loving little darling i really cant see why you should object to the #name# of $algernon_moncrieff$
$algernon_moncrieff$ it is not at all a bad #name# in #fact# it is rather an aristocratic #name# half of the chaps who get into the bankruptcy court are called $algernon_moncrieff$
but seriously $miss_cecily_cardew$ moving to her if my #name# was algy couldnt you love me
i might respect you $mr_ernest_worthing$ i might admire your character but i fear that i should not be able to give you my undivided attention
$miss_cecily_cardew$ rising $algernon_moncrieff$ ahem $miss_cecily_cardew$ picking up hat your rector here is i suppose thoroughly experienced in the practice of all the rites and ceremonials of the church
$miss_cecily_cardew$ oh yes $dr_chasuble$ is a most learned #man# he has never written a single book so you can imagine how much he knows
$algernon_moncrieff$ i must see him at once on a most important christening i mean on most important business $miss_cecily_cardew$ oh $algernon_moncrieff$ i shant be away more than half an hour
considering that we have been engaged since february the th and that i only met you to #day# for the first #time# i think it is rather hard that you should leave me for so long a period as half an hour
$miss_cecily_cardew$ couldnt you make it twenty minutes $algernon_moncrieff$ i ll be back in no #time# kisses her and rushes down the garden
$miss_cecily_cardew$ what an impetuous boy he is i like his hair so much i must enter his proposal in my diary
enter $merriman$ merriman a miss fairfax has just called to see $mr_ernest_worthing$ on very important business miss fairfax states $miss_cecily_cardew$
isnt $mr_ernest_worthing$ in his library $merriman$ $mr_ernest_worthing$ went over in the direction of the rectory some #time# ago $miss_cecily_cardew$
pray ask the lady to come out here $mr_ernest_worthing$ is sure to be back soon and you can bring #tea#
i suppose #one# of the many good elderly #woman# who are associated with $uncle_jack$ in some of his philanthropic #work# in london
$merriman$ yes miss goes out $miss_cecily_cardew$ miss fairfax i dont quite like #woman# who are interested in philanthropic #work# i think it is so forward of them
enter $merriman$ merriman miss fairfax enter $gwendolen$ exit $merriman$ $miss_cecily_cardew$ advancing to meet her pray let me introduce myself to you
my #name# is $miss_cecily_cardew$ $gwendolen$ $miss_cecily_cardew$ moving to her and shaking #hand# what a very sweet #name# something tells me that we are going to be great friends
i like you already more than i can say my first impressions of #people# are never wrong $miss_cecily_cardew$ how nice of you to like me so much after we have known each other such a comparatively short #time#
pray sit down $gwendolen$ still standing up i may call you $miss_cecily_cardew$ may i not $miss_cecily_cardew$ with pleasure $gwendolen$ and you will always call me $gwendolen$ wont you
$miss_cecily_cardew$ if you wish $gwendolen$ then that is all quite settled is it not $miss_cecily_cardew$ i hope so a pause they both sit down together
$gwendolen$ perhaps this might be a favourable opportunity for my mentioning who i am my father is lord bracknell you have never heard of papa i suppose
$miss_cecily_cardew$ i dont think so $gwendolen$ outside the family circle papa i am glad to say is entirely unknown i think that is quite as it should be
the home seems to me to be the proper sphere for the #man# and certainly once a #man# begins to neglect his domestic duties he becomes painfully effeminate does he not
$miss_cecily_cardew$ mamma whose views on education are remarkably strict has brought me up to be extremely short sighted it is part of her system so do you mind my looking at you through my glasses
and i dont like that it makes #man# so very attractive $miss_cecily_cardew$ oh not at all $gwendolen$ i am very fond of being looked at
$gwendolen$ after examining $miss_cecily_cardew$ carefully through a lorgnette you are here on a short visit i suppose $miss_cecily_cardew$ oh no i live here
$gwendolen$ severely really your mother no doubt or some female relative of advanced #year# resides here also $miss_cecily_cardew$ oh no i have no mother nor in #fact# any relations
$gwendolen$ indeed $miss_cecily_cardew$ my dear guardian with the assistance of miss prism has the arduous task of looking after me $gwendolen$
your guardian $miss_cecily_cardew$ yes i am $mr_ernest_worthing$ ward $gwendolen$ oh it is strange he never mentioned to me that he had a ward
how secretive of him he grows more interesting hourly i am not sure however that the news inspires me with feelings of unmixed delight
rising and going to her i am very fond of you $miss_cecily_cardew$ i have liked you ever since i met you
but i am bound to state that now that i know that you are $mr_ernest_worthing$ ward i cannot help expressing a wish you were well just a little older than you seem to be and not quite so very alluring in appearance
in #fact# if i may speak candidly $miss_cecily_cardew$ pray do i think that whenever #one# has #anything# unpleasant to say #one# should always be quite candid
well to speak with perfect candour $miss_cecily_cardew$ i wish that you were fully forty two and more than usually plain for your age
$gwendolen$ $mr_ernest_worthing$ has a strong upright nature he is the very soul of truth and honour disloyalty would be as impossible to him as deception
but even #man# of the noblest possible moral character are extremely susceptible to the influence of the physical charms of others
modern no less than ancient history supplies us with many most painful examples of what i refer to if it were not so indeed history would be quite unreadable
$miss_cecily_cardew$ i beg your pardon $gwendolen$ did you say $mr_ernest_worthing$ $gwendolen$ yes $miss_cecily_cardew$ oh but it is not $mr_ernest_worthing$ who is my guardian
it is his #brother# his elder #brother# $gwendolen$ sitting down again $mr_ernest_worthing$ never mentioned to me that he had a #brother# $miss_cecily_cardew$
i am sorry to say they have not been on good terms for a long #time# $gwendolen$ ah that accounts for it
and now that i think of it i have never heard any #man# mention his #brother# the subject seems distasteful to most #man#
$miss_cecily_cardew$ you have lifted a load from my mind i was growing almost anxious it would have been terrible if any cloud had come across a friendship like ours would it not
of course you are quite quite sure that it is not $mr_ernest_worthing$ who is your guardian $miss_cecily_cardew$ quite sure
a pause in #fact# i am going to be his $gwendolen$ inquiringly i beg your pardon $miss_cecily_cardew$ rather shy and confidingly
dearest $gwendolen$ there is no reason why i should make a secret of it to you our little county newspaper is sure to chronicle the #fact# next week
$mr_ernest_worthing$ and i are engaged to be married $gwendolen$ quite politely rising my darling $miss_cecily_cardew$ i think there must be some slight error
$mr_ernest_worthing$ is engaged to me the announcement will appear in the morning post on saturday at the latest $miss_cecily_cardew$
very politely rising i am afraid you must be under some misconception $mr_ernest_worthing$ proposed to me exactly ten minutes ago shows diary
$gwendolen$ examines diary through her lorgnettte carefully it is certainly very curious for he asked me to be his wife yesterday afternoon at
if you would care to verify the incident pray do so produces diary of her own i never travel without my diary
i am so sorry dear $miss_cecily_cardew$ if it is any disappointment to you but i am afraid i have the prior claim
it would distress me more than i can tell you dear $gwendolen$ if it caused you any mental or physical anguish but i feel bound to point out that since $mr_ernest_worthing$ proposed to you he clearly has changed his mind
if the poor fellow has been entrapped into any foolish promise i shall consider it my duty to rescue him at once and with a firm #hand#
whatever unfortunate entanglement my dear boy may have got into i will never reproach him with it after we are married
#one# should always have something sensational to read in the train $miss_cecily_cardew$ $gwendolen$ meditatively $miss_cecily_cardew$ thoughtfully and sadly $gwendolen$ do you allude to me $miss_cecily_cardew$ as an entanglement
you are presumptuous on an occasion of this kind it becomes more than a moral duty to speak #one# mind it becomes a pleasure
$miss_cecily_cardew$ do you suggest miss fairfax that i entrapped $mr_ernest_worthing$ into an engagement how dare you this is no #time# for wearing the shallow mask of manners
when i see a spade i call it a spade $gwendolen$ satirically i am glad to say that i have never seen a spade
it is obvious that our social spheres have been widely different enter $merriman$ followed by the footman he carries a salver table cloth and plate stand
$miss_cecily_cardew$ is about to retort the presence of the servants exercises a restraining influence under which both #girl# chafe $merriman$ shall i lay #tea# here as usual miss
$miss_cecily_cardew$ sternly in a calm voice yes as usual $merriman$ begins to clear table and lay cloth a long pause $miss_cecily_cardew$ and $gwendolen$ glare at each other
$gwendolen$ are there many interesting walks in the vicinity $miss_cecily_cardew$ $miss_cecily_cardew$ oh yes a great many from the top of #one# of the hills quite close #one# can see five counties
$gwendolen$ five counties i dont think i should like that i hate crowds $miss_cecily_cardew$ sweetly i suppose that is why you live in #town#
$gwendolen$ bites her lip and beats her foot nervously with her parasol $gwendolen$ looking round quite a well kept garden this is $miss_cecily_cardew$
$miss_cecily_cardew$ so glad you like it miss fairfax $gwendolen$ i had no idea there were any flowers in the #country# $miss_cecily_cardew$
oh flowers are as common here miss fairfax as #people# are in london $gwendolen$ personally i cannot understand how anybody manages to exist in the #country# if anybody who is anybody does
the #country# always bores me to death $miss_cecily_cardew$ ah this is what the newspapers call agricultural depression is it not i believe the aristocracy are suffering very much from it just at present
it is almost an epidemic amongst them i have been told may i offer you some #tea# miss fairfax $gwendolen$ with elaborate politeness
thank you aside detestable #girl# but i require #tea# $miss_cecily_cardew$ sweetly sugar $gwendolen$ superciliously no thank you sugar is not fashionable any more
$miss_cecily_cardew$ looks angrily at her takes up the tongs and puts four lumps of sugar into the cup $miss_cecily_cardew$ severely cake or bread and butter
$gwendolen$ in a bored manner bread and butter please cake is rarely seen at the best #house# nowadays $miss_cecily_cardew$ cuts a very large slice of cake and puts it on the tray
#hand# that to miss fairfax $merriman$ does so and goes out with footman $gwendolen$ drinks the #tea# and makes a grimace
puts down cup at once reaches out her #hand# to the bread and butter looks at it and finds it is cake
you have filled my #tea# with lumps of sugar and though i asked most distinctly for bread and butter you have given me cake
i am known for the gentleness of my disposition and the extraordinary sweetness of my nature but i warn you $miss_cecily_cardew$ you may go too far
to save my poor innocent trusting boy from the machinations of any other #girl# there are no lengths to which i would not go
rises in indignation $gwendolen$ $miss_cecily_cardew$ rising $gwendolen$ from the #moment# i saw you i distrusted you i felt that you were false and deceitful
i am never deceived in such matters my first impressions of #people# are invariably right $miss_cecily_cardew$ it seems to me miss fairfax that i am trespassing on your valuable #time#
no doubt you have many other calls of a similar character to make in the neighbourhood enter $uncle_jack$ $gwendolen$ catching sight of him
$mr_ernest_worthing$ my own $mr_ernest_worthing$ $uncle_jack$ $gwendolen$ darling offers to kiss her $gwendolen$ draws back a #moment# may i ask if you are engaged to be married to this young lady
points to $miss_cecily_cardew$ $uncle_jack$ laughing to dear little $miss_cecily_cardew$ of course not what could have put such an idea into your pretty little head
$gwendolen$ thank you you may offers her cheek $miss_cecily_cardew$ very sweetly i knew there must be some misunderstanding miss fairfax the gentleman whose arm is at present round your waist is my guardian mr john $mr_ernest_worthing$
$gwendolen$ i beg your pardon $miss_cecily_cardew$ this is $uncle_jack$ $gwendolen$ receding $uncle_jack$ oh enter $algernon_moncrieff$ $miss_cecily_cardew$ here is $mr_ernest_worthing$ $algernon_moncrieff$
goes straight over to $miss_cecily_cardew$ without noticing any #one# else my own love offers to kiss her $miss_cecily_cardew$ drawing back a #moment# $mr_ernest_worthing$
may i ask you are you engaged to be married to this young lady $algernon_moncrieff$ looking round to what young lady good heavens
$gwendolen$ $miss_cecily_cardew$ yes to good heavens $gwendolen$ i mean to $gwendolen$ $algernon_moncrieff$ laughing of course not what could have put such an idea into your pretty little head
$miss_cecily_cardew$ thank you presenting her cheek to be kissed you may $algernon_moncrieff$ kisses her $gwendolen$ i felt there was some slight error $miss_cecily_cardew$
the gentleman who is now embracing you is my cousin mr $algernon_moncrieff$ $miss_cecily_cardew$ breaking away from $algernon_moncrieff$ $algernon_moncrieff$ oh
the two #girl# move towards each other and put their arms round each other waists as if for protection $miss_cecily_cardew$ are you called $algernon_moncrieff$
$algernon_moncrieff$ i cannot deny it $miss_cecily_cardew$ oh $gwendolen$ is your #name# really john $uncle_jack$ standing rather proudly i could deny it if i liked
i could deny #anything# if i liked but my #name# certainly is john it has been john for #year# $miss_cecily_cardew$ to $gwendolen$
a gross deception has been practised on both of us $gwendolen$ my poor wounded $miss_cecily_cardew$ cecily my sweet wronged $gwendolen$ gwendolen
slowly and seriously you will call me sister will you not they embrace $uncle_jack$ and $algernon_moncrieff$ groan and walk up and down
$miss_cecily_cardew$ rather brightly there is just #one# question i would like to be allowed to ask my guardian $gwendolen$ an admirable idea
$mr_ernest_worthing$ there is just #one# question i would like to be permitted to put to you where is your #brother# $mr_ernest_worthing$
we are both engaged to be married to your #brother# $mr_ernest_worthing$ so it is a matter of some importance to us to know where your #brother# $mr_ernest_worthing$ is at present
it is the first #time# in my #life# that i have ever been reduced to such a painful position and i am really quite inexperienced in doing #anything# of the kind
$uncle_jack$ slowly and hesitatingly $gwendolen$ $miss_cecily_cardew$ it is very painful for me to be forced to speak the truth however i will tell you quite frankly that i have no #brother# $mr_ernest_worthing$
i never had a #brother# in my #life# and i certainly have not the smallest intention of ever having #one# in the future
i have no #brother# at all $miss_cecily_cardew$ surprised no #brother# at all $uncle_jack$ cheerily none $gwendolen$ severely had you never a #brother# of any kind
$uncle_jack$ pleasantly never not even of any kind $gwendolen$ i am afraid it is quite clear $miss_cecily_cardew$ that neither of us is engaged to be married to any #one#
$miss_cecily_cardew$ it is not a very pleasant position for a young #girl# suddenly to find herself in is it $gwendolen$ let us go into the #house#
they will hardly venture to come after us there $miss_cecily_cardew$ no #man# are so cowardly arent they they retire into the #house# with scornful looks
$uncle_jack$ this ghastly state of #thing# is what you call bunburying i suppose $algernon_moncrieff$ yes and a perfectly wonderful $mr_bunbury$ it is
the most wonderful $mr_bunbury$ i have ever had in my #life# $uncle_jack$ well you ve no right whatsoever to $mr_bunbury$ here $algernon_moncrieff$
that is absurd #one# has a right to $mr_bunbury$ anywhere #one# chooses every serious bunburyist knows that $uncle_jack$ serious bunburyist good heavens
$algernon_moncrieff$ well #one# must be serious about something if #one# wants to have any amusement in #life# i happen to be serious about bunburying
what on earth you are serious about i havent got the remotest idea about everything i should fancy you have such an absolutely trivial nature
well the only small satisfaction i have in the whole of this wretched business is that your friend $mr_bunbury$ is quite exploded
$uncle_jack$ you wont be able to run down to the #country# quite so often as you used to do dear algy
and a very good #thing# too $algernon_moncrieff$ your #brother# is a little off colour isnt he dear $uncle_jack$ you wont be able to disappear to london quite so frequently as your wicked custom was
as for your conduct towards $miss_cecily_cardew$ i must say that your taking in a sweet simple innocent #girl# like that is quite inexcusable
and not a bad #thing# either $uncle_jack$ to say nothing of the #fact# that she is my ward $algernon_moncrieff$ i can see no possible defence at all for your deceiving
a brilliant clever thoroughly experienced young lady like miss fairfax to say nothing of the #fact# that she is my cousin
$uncle_jack$ i wanted to be engaged to $gwendolen$ that is all i love her $algernon_moncrieff$ well i simply wanted to be engaged to $miss_cecily_cardew$
i adore her $uncle_jack$ there is certainly no chance of your marrying $miss_cecily_cardew$ $algernon_moncrieff$ i dont think there is much likelihood $uncle_jack$ of you and miss fairfax being united
$uncle_jack$ well that is no business of yours $algernon_moncrieff$ if it was my business i wouldnt talk about it begins to eat muffins
it is very vulgar to talk about #one# business only #people# like stock brokers do that and then merely at dinner parties
$uncle_jack$ how can you sit there calmly eating muffins when we are in this horrible trouble i cant make out you seem to me to be perfectly heartless
$algernon_moncrieff$ well i cant eat muffins in an agitated manner the butter would probably get on my cuffs #one# should always eat muffins quite calmly
it is the only #way# to eat them $uncle_jack$ i say it perfectly heartless your eating muffins at all under the circumstances
indeed when i am in really great trouble as any #one# who knows me intimately will tell you i refuse everything except food and drink
$algernon_moncrieff$ when i am in trouble eating is the only #thing# that consoles me at the present #moment# i am eating muffins because i am unhappy
besides i am particularly fond of muffins rising $uncle_jack$ rising well that is no reason why you should eat them all in that greedy #way#
takes muffins from $algernon_moncrieff$ algernon offering #tea# cake i wish you would have #tea# cake instead i dont like #tea# cake $uncle_jack$ good heavens
i suppose a #man# may eat his own muffins in his own garden $algernon_moncrieff$ but you have just said it was perfectly heartless to eat muffins
$uncle_jack$ i said it was perfectly heartless of you under the circumstances that is a very different #thing# $algernon_moncrieff$ that may be
but the muffins are the same he seizes the muffin dish from $uncle_jack$ jack algy i wish to goodness you would go
$algernon_moncrieff$ you cant possibly ask me to go without having some dinner it absurd i never go without my dinner no #one# ever does except vegetarians and #people# like that
besides i have just made arrangements with $dr_chasuble$ to be christened at a quarter to six under the #name# of $mr_ernest_worthing$
i made arrangements this morning with $dr_chasuble$ to be christened myself at and i naturally will take the #name# of $mr_ernest_worthing$
$uncle_jack$ my dear fellow the sooner you give up that nonsense the better $gwendolen$ would wish it we cant both be christened $mr_ernest_worthing$
it absurd besides i have a perfect right to be christened if i like there is no evidence at all that i have ever been christened by anybody
i should think it extremely probable i never was and so does $dr_chasuble$ it is entirely different in your #case#
you have been christened already $algernon_moncrieff$ yes but i have not been christened for #year# $uncle_jack$ yes but you have been christened
if you are not quite sure about your ever having been christened i must say i think it rather dangerous your venturing on it now
that is the important #thing# $algernon_moncrieff$ quite so so i know my constitution can stand it it might make you very unwell
you can hardly have forgotten that some #one# very closely connected with you was very nearly carried off this week in paris by a severe chill
$uncle_jack$ yes but you said yourself that a severe chill was not hereditary $algernon_moncrieff$ it usent to be i know but i daresay it is now
science is always making wonderful improvements in #thing# $uncle_jack$ picking up the muffin dish oh that is nonsense you are always talking nonsense
$algernon_moncrieff$ $uncle_jack$ you are at the muffins again i wish you wouldnt there are only two left takes them i told you i was particularly fond of muffins
$uncle_jack$ but i hate #tea# cake $algernon_moncrieff$ why on earth then do you allow #tea# cake to be served up for your guests
what ideas you have of hospitality $uncle_jack$ $algernon_moncrieff$ i have already told you to go i dont want you here why dont you go
$algernon_moncrieff$ i havent quite finished my #tea# yet and there is still #one# muffin left $uncle_jack$ groans and sinks into a chair
$algernon_moncrieff$ still continues eating act drop third act scene morning #room# at the manor #house# $gwendolen$ and $miss_cecily_cardew$ are at the window looking out into the garden
the #fact# that they did not follow us at once into the #house# as any #one# else would have done seems to me to show that they have some sense of shame left
$gwendolen$ $miss_cecily_cardew$ they have been eating muffins that looks like repentance $gwendolen$ after a pause they dont seem to notice us at all
couldnt you cough $miss_cecily_cardew$ but i havent got a cough $gwendolen$ they re looking at us what effrontery $miss_cecily_cardew$ they re approaching that very forward of them
$gwendolen$ let us preserve a dignified silence $miss_cecily_cardew$ certainly it the only #thing# to do now enter $uncle_jack$ followed by $algernon_moncrieff$
they whistle some dreadful popular air from a british opera $gwendolen$ this dignified silence seems to produce an unpleasant effect $miss_cecily_cardew$
a most distasteful #one# $gwendolen$ but we will not be the first to speak $miss_cecily_cardew$ certainly not $gwendolen$ $mr_ernest_worthing$ i have something very particular to ask you
much depends on your reply $miss_cecily_cardew$ $gwendolen$ your common sense is invaluable mr $algernon_moncrieff$ kindly answer me the following question why did you pretend to be my guardian #brother#
$algernon_moncrieff$ in order that i might have an opportunity of meeting you $miss_cecily_cardew$ to $gwendolen$ that certainly seems a satisfactory explanation does it not
$gwendolen$ yes dear if you can believe him $miss_cecily_cardew$ i dont but that does not affect the wonderful beauty of his answer
$gwendolen$ true in matters of grave importance style not sincerity is the vital #thing# $mr_ernest_worthing$ what explanation can you offer to me for pretending to have a #brother#
was it in order that you might have an opportunity of coming up to #town# to see me as often as possible
$uncle_jack$ can you doubt it miss fairfax $gwendolen$ i have the gravest doubts upon the subject but i intend to crush them
this is not the #moment# for german scepticism moving to $miss_cecily_cardew$ their explanations appear to be quite satisfactory especially $mr_ernest_worthing$
that seems to me to have the stamp of truth upon it $miss_cecily_cardew$ i am more than content with what mr $algernon_moncrieff$ said
his voice alone inspires #one# with absolute credulity $gwendolen$ then you think we should forgive them $miss_cecily_cardew$ yes i mean no
$gwendolen$ true i had forgotten there are principles at stake that #one# cannot surrender which of us should tell them the task is not a pleasant #one#
$miss_cecily_cardew$ could we not both speak at the same #time# $gwendolen$ an excellent idea i nearly always speak at the same #time# as other #people#
will you take the #time# from me $miss_cecily_cardew$ certainly $gwendolen$ beats #time# with uplifted finger $gwendolen$ and $miss_cecily_cardew$ speaking together your christian #name# are still an insuperable barrier
that is all $uncle_jack$ and $algernon_moncrieff$ speaking together our christian #name# is that all but we are going to be christened this afternoon
$gwendolen$ to $uncle_jack$ for my sake you are prepared to do this terrible #thing# $uncle_jack$ i am $miss_cecily_cardew$ to $algernon_moncrieff$ to please me you are ready to face this fearful ordeal
$algernon_moncrieff$ i am $gwendolen$ how absurd to talk of the equality of the sexes where questions of self sacrifice are concerned #man# are infinitely beyond us
$uncle_jack$ we are clasps #hand# with $algernon_moncrieff$ $miss_cecily_cardew$ they have #moment# of physical courage of which we #woman# know absolutely nothing
$gwendolen$ to $uncle_jack$ darling $algernon_moncrieff$ to $miss_cecily_cardew$ darling they fall into each other arms enter $merriman$ when he enters he coughs loudly seeing the situation
$merriman$ ahem ahem $lady_bracknell$ $uncle_jack$ good heavens enter $lady_bracknell$ the couples separate in alarm exit $merriman$ $lady_bracknell$ $gwendolen$
what does this mean $gwendolen$ merely that i am engaged to be married to $mr_ernest_worthing$ mamma $lady_bracknell$ come here
sit down sit down immediately hesitation of any kind is a sign of mental decay in the young of physical weakness in the old
apprised #sir# of my daughter sudden flight by her trusty maid whose confidence i purchased by means of a small coin i followed her at once by a luggage train
her unhappy father is i am glad to say under the impression that she is attending a more than usually lengthy lecture by the university extension scheme on the influence of a permanent income on thought
turns to $uncle_jack$ i do not propose to undeceive him indeed i have never undeceived him on any question i would consider it wrong
but of course you will clearly understand that all communication between yourself and my daughter must cease immediately from this #moment#
on this point as indeed on all points i am firm $uncle_jack$ i am engaged to be married to $gwendolen$ $lady_bracknell$
$lady_bracknell$ you are nothing of the kind #sir# and now as regards $algernon_moncrieff$ algernon $algernon_moncrieff$ yes aunt augusta
$lady_bracknell$ may i ask if it is in this #house# that your invalid friend $mr_bunbury$ resides $algernon_moncrieff$ stammering oh
no $mr_bunbury$ doesnt live here $mr_bunbury$ is somewhere else at present in #fact# $mr_bunbury$ is dead $lady_bracknell$ dead when did $mr_bunbury$ die
his death must have been extremely sudden $algernon_moncrieff$ airily oh i killed $mr_bunbury$ this afternoon i mean poor $mr_bunbury$ died this afternoon
$lady_bracknell$ what did he die of $algernon_moncrieff$ $mr_bunbury$ oh he was quite exploded $lady_bracknell$ exploded was he the victim of a revolutionary outrage
i was not aware that $mr_bunbury$ was interested in social legislation if so he is well punished for his morbidity
$algernon_moncrieff$ my dear aunt augusta i mean he was found out the doctors found out that $mr_bunbury$ could not live that is what i mean so $mr_bunbury$ died
i am glad however that he made up his mind at the last to some definite course of action and acted under proper medical advice
and now that we have finally got rid of this $mr_bunbury$ may i ask $mr_ernest_worthing$ who is that young person whose #hand# my nephew $algernon_moncrieff$ is now holding in what seems to me a peculiarly unnecessary manner
$lady_bracknell$ he seems to have had great confidence in the opinion of his physicians $uncle_jack$ that lady is $miss_cecily_cardew$ my ward
$lady_bracknell$ bows coldly to $miss_cecily_cardew$ $algernon_moncrieff$ i am engaged to be married to $miss_cecily_cardew$ aunt augusta $lady_bracknell$ i beg your pardon
$miss_cecily_cardew$ mr $algernon_moncrieff$ and i are engaged to be married $lady_bracknell$ lady bracknell with a shiver crossing to the sofa and sitting down
i do not know whether there is #anything# peculiarly exciting in the air of this particular part of hertfordshire but the number of engagements that go on seems to me considerably above the proper average that statistics have laid down for our guidance
i think some preliminary inquiry on my part would not be out of place $mr_ernest_worthing$ is $miss_cecily_cardew$ at all connected with any of the larger railway stations in london
i merely desire information until yesterday i had no idea that there were any families or persons whose origin was a terminus
$miss_cecily_cardew$ is the grand daughter of the late mr thomas $miss_cecily_cardew$ of belgrave square w gervase park dorking surrey and the sporran fifeshire b $lady_bracknell$
$uncle_jack$ looks perfectly furious but restrains himself $uncle_jack$ in a clear cold voice that sounds not unsatisfactory three addresses always inspire confidence even in tradesmen
but what proof have i of their authenticity $uncle_jack$ i have carefully preserved the court guides of the period they are open to your inspection $lady_bracknell$
$lady_bracknell$ grimly i have known strange errors in that publication $uncle_jack$ $miss_cecily_cardew$ family solicitors are messrs markby markby and markby
$lady_bracknell$ markby markby and markby a firm of the very highest position in their profession indeed i am told that #one# of the mr markby is occasionally to be seen at dinner parties
i have also in my possession you will be pleased to hear certificates of $miss_cecily_cardew$ birth baptism whooping cough registration vaccination confirmation and the measles both the german and the english variety
so far i am satisfied $uncle_jack$ very irritably how extremely kind of you $lady_bracknell$ lady bracknell ah a #life# crowded with incident i see though perhaps somewhat too exciting for a young #girl#
i am not myself in favour of premature experiences rises looks at her watch $gwendolen$ the #time# approaches for our departure
we have not a #moment# to lose as a matter of form $mr_ernest_worthing$ i had better ask you if $miss_cecily_cardew$ has any little fortune
$uncle_jack$ oh about a hundred and thirty thousand pounds in the funds that is all goodbye $lady_bracknell$ so pleased to have seen you
$lady_bracknell$ sitting down again a #moment# $mr_ernest_worthing$ a hundred and thirty thousand pounds and in the funds $miss_cecily_cardew$ seems to me a most attractive young lady now that i look at her
few #girl# of the present #day# have any really solid qualities any of the qualities that last and improve with #time#
we live i regret to say in an age of surfaces to $miss_cecily_cardew$ come over here dear $miss_cecily_cardew$ goes across
pretty child your dress is sadly simple and your hair seems almost as nature might have left it but we can soon alter all that
a thoroughly experienced french maid produces a really marvellous result in a very brief space of #time# i remember recommending #one# to young lady lancing and after three months her own husband did not know her
$uncle_jack$ and after six months nobody knew her $lady_bracknell$ glares at $uncle_jack$ for a few #moment# then bends with a practised smile to $miss_cecily_cardew$
kindly turn round sweet child $miss_cecily_cardew$ turns completely round no the side view is what i want $miss_cecily_cardew$ presents her profile
yes quite as i expected there are distinct social possibilities in your profile the two weak points in our age are its want of principle and its want of profile
the chin a little higher dear style largely depends on the #way# the chin is worn they are worn very high just at present
$algernon_moncrieff$ algernon yes aunt augusta $lady_bracknell$ there are distinct social possibilities in $miss_cecily_cardew$ profile $algernon_moncrieff$ $miss_cecily_cardew$ is the sweetest dearest prettiest #girl# in the whole world
and i dont care twopence about social possibilities $lady_bracknell$ never speak disrespectfully of society $algernon_moncrieff$ only #people# who cant get into it do that
to $miss_cecily_cardew$ dear child of course you know that $algernon_moncrieff$ has nothing but his debts to depend upon but i do not approve of mercenary marriages
when i married lord bracknell i had no fortune of any kind but i never dreamed for a #moment# of allowing that to stand in my #way#
well i suppose i must give my consent $algernon_moncrieff$ thank you aunt augusta $lady_bracknell$ $miss_cecily_cardew$ you may kiss me $miss_cecily_cardew$
kisses her thank you $lady_bracknell$ lady bracknell you may also address me as aunt augusta for the future $miss_cecily_cardew$ thank you aunt augusta
$lady_bracknell$ the marriage i think had better take place quite soon $algernon_moncrieff$ thank you aunt augusta $miss_cecily_cardew$ thank you aunt augusta
$lady_bracknell$ to speak frankly i am not in favour of long engagements they give #people# the opportunity of finding out each other character before marriage which i think is never advisable
$uncle_jack$ i beg your pardon for interrupting you $lady_bracknell$ but this engagement is quite out of the question i am $miss_cecily_cardew$ guardian and she cannot marry without my consent until she comes of age
that consent i absolutely decline to give $lady_bracknell$ upon what grounds may i ask $algernon_moncrieff$ is an extremely i may almost say an ostentatiously eligible young #man#
it pains me very much to have to speak frankly to you $lady_bracknell$ about your nephew but the #fact# is that i do not approve at all of his moral character
he has nothing but he looks everything what more can #one# desire $uncle_jack$ i suspect him of being untruthful $algernon_moncrieff$ and $miss_cecily_cardew$ look at him in indignant amazement
$lady_bracknell$ untruthful my nephew $algernon_moncrieff$ impossible he is an oxonian $uncle_jack$ i fear there can be no possible doubt about the matter
this afternoon during my temporary absence in london on an important question of romance he obtained admission to my #house# by means of the false pretence of being my #brother#
under an assumed #name# he drank i ve just been informed by my butler an entire pint bottle of my perrier jouet brut wine i was specially reserving for myself
continuing his disgraceful deception he succeeded in the course of the afternoon in alienating the affections of my only ward he subsequently stayed to #tea# and devoured every single muffin
and what makes his conduct all the more heartless is that he was perfectly well aware from the first that i have no #brother# that i never had a #brother# and that i dont intend to have a #brother# not even of any kind
i distinctly told him so myself yesterday afternoon $lady_bracknell$ ahem $mr_ernest_worthing$ after careful consideration i have decided entirely to overlook my nephew conduct to you
$uncle_jack$ that is very generous of you $lady_bracknell$ my own decision however is unalterable i decline to give my consent
$lady_bracknell$ to $miss_cecily_cardew$ come here sweet child $miss_cecily_cardew$ goes over how old are you dear $miss_cecily_cardew$ well i am really only eighteen but i always admit to twenty when i go to evening parties
$lady_bracknell$ you are perfectly right in making some slight alteration indeed no #woman# should ever be quite accurate about her age
it looks so calculating in a meditative manner eighteen but admitting to twenty at evening parties well it will not be very long before you are of age and free from the restraints of tutelage
pray excuse me $lady_bracknell$ for interrupting you again but it is only fair to tell you that according to the terms of her grandfather will $miss_cecily_cardew$ does not come legally of age till she is thirty five
so i dont think your guardian consent is after all a matter of any importance $uncle_jack$ $lady_bracknell$ that does not seem to me to be a grave objection
london society is full of #woman# of the very highest birth who have of their own free choice remained thirty five for #year#
to my own knowledge she has been thirty five ever since she arrived at the age of forty which was many #year# ago now
i see no reason why our dear $miss_cecily_cardew$ should not be even still more attractive at the age you mention than she is at present
thirty five is a very attractive age lady dumbleton is an instance in point there will be a large accumulation of property
$miss_cecily_cardew$ algy could you wait for me till i was thirty five $algernon_moncrieff$ of course i could $miss_cecily_cardew$ you know i could
$miss_cecily_cardew$ yes i felt it instinctively but i couldnt wait all that #time# i hate waiting even five minutes for anybody
i am not punctual myself i know but i do like punctuality in others and waiting even to be married is quite out of the question
it always makes me rather cross $algernon_moncrieff$ then what is to be done $miss_cecily_cardew$ cecily i dont know mr $algernon_moncrieff$ $lady_bracknell$
my dear $mr_ernest_worthing$ as $miss_cecily_cardew$ states positively that she cannot wait till she is thirty five a remark which i am bound to say seems to me to show a somewhat impatient nature i would beg of you to reconsider your decision
the #moment# you consent to my marriage with $gwendolen$ i will most gladly allow your nephew to form an alliance with my ward
$uncle_jack$ but my dear $lady_bracknell$ the matter is entirely in your own #hand# $lady_bracknell$ rising and drawing herself up
you must be quite aware that what you propose is out of the question $uncle_jack$ then a passionate celibacy is all that any of us can look forward to
$lady_bracknell$ that is not the destiny i propose for $gwendolen$ $algernon_moncrieff$ of course can choose for himself pulls out her watch
come dear $gwendolen$ rises we have already missed five if not six trains to miss any more might expose us to comment on the platform
enter $dr_chasuble$ chasuble everything is quite ready for the christenings $lady_bracknell$ the christenings #sir# is not that somewhat premature
chasuble looking rather puzzled and pointing to $uncle_jack$ and $algernon_moncrieff$ both these gentlemen have expressed a desire for immediate baptism $lady_bracknell$
at their age the idea is grotesque and irreligious $algernon_moncrieff$ i forbid you to be baptized i will not hear of such excesses
lord bracknell would be highly displeased if he learned that that was the #way# in which you wasted your #time# and money
i dont think that as #thing# are now it would be of much practical value to either of us $dr_chasuble$
chasuble am i to understand then that there are to be no christenings at all this afternoon $uncle_jack$ chasuble i am grieved to hear such sentiments from you $mr_ernest_worthing$
they savour of the heretical views of the anabaptists views that i have completely refuted in four of my unpublished sermons
indeed i have just been informed by the pew opener that for the last hour and a half miss prism has been waiting for me in the vestry
however as your present mood seems to be #one# peculiarly secular i will return to the church at once $lady_bracknell$
starting miss prism did i hear you mention a miss prism chasuble yes $lady_bracknell$ i am on my #way# to join her
$lady_bracknell$ pray allow me to detain you for a #moment# this matter may prove to be #one# of vital importance to lord bracknell and myself
is this miss prism a female of repellent aspect remotely connected with education chasuble somewhat indignantly she is the most cultivated of ladies and the very picture of respectability
$lady_bracknell$ it is obviously the same person may i ask what position she holds in your household chasuble severely i am a celibate madam
$uncle_jack$ interposing miss prism $lady_bracknell$ has been for the last three #year# $miss_cecily_cardew$ esteemed governess and valued companion $lady_bracknell$
in spite of what i hear of her i must see her at once let her be sent for chasuble looking off
she approaches she is nigh enter miss prism hurriedly miss prism i was told you expected me in the vestry dear canon
i have been waiting for you there for an hour and three quarters catches sight of $lady_bracknell$ who has fixed her with a stony glare
miss prism grows pale and quails she looks anxiously round as if desirous to escape $lady_bracknell$ in a severe judicial voice
prism miss prism bows her head in shame come here prism miss prism approaches in a humble manner prism where is that baby
$algernon_moncrieff$ and $uncle_jack$ pretend to be anxious to shield $miss_cecily_cardew$ and $gwendolen$ from hearing the details of a terrible public scandal
twenty eight #year# ago prism you left lord bracknell #house# number upper grosvenor street in charge of a perambulator that contained a baby of the male sex
a few weeks later through the elaborate investigations of the metropolitan police the perambulator was discovered at midnight standing by itself in a remote corner of bayswater
general consternation the canon starts back in horror you never returned it contained the manuscript of a three volume novel of more than usually revolting sentimentality
miss prism starts in involuntary indignation but the baby was not there every #one# looks at miss prism prism where is that baby
a pause miss prism $lady_bracknell$ i admit with shame that i do not know i only wish i did the plain #fact# of the #case# are these
on the morning of the #day# you mention a #day# that is for ever branded on my memory i prepared as usual to take the baby out in its perambulator
i had also with me a somewhat old but capacious #hand# #bag# in which i had intended to place the manuscript of a #work# of fiction that i had written during my few unoccupied hours
in a #moment# of mental abstraction for which i never can forgive myself i deposited the manuscript in the basinette and placed the baby in the #hand# #bag#
$uncle_jack$ who has been listening attentively but where did you deposit the #hand# #bag# miss prism do not ask me $mr_ernest_worthing$
$uncle_jack$ miss prism this is a matter of no small importance to me i insist on knowing where you deposited the #hand# #bag# that contained that infant
miss prism i left it in the cloak #room# of #one# of the larger railway stations in london $uncle_jack$ what railway station
miss prism quite crushed victoria the brighton line sinks into a chair $uncle_jack$ i must retire to my #room# for a #moment#
$gwendolen$ wait here for me $gwendolen$ if you are not too long i will wait here for you all my #life#
exit $uncle_jack$ in great excitement chasuble what do you think this means $lady_bracknell$ lady bracknell i dare not even suspect $dr_chasuble$
i need hardly tell you that in families of high position strange coincidences are not supposed to occur they are hardly considered the #thing#
noises heard overhead as if some #one# was throwing trunks about every #one# looks up $miss_cecily_cardew$ $uncle_jack$ seems strangely agitated
chasuble your guardian has a very emotional nature $lady_bracknell$ this noise is extremely unpleasant it sounds as if he was having an argument
i dislike arguments of any kind they are always vulgar and often convincing chasuble looking up it has stopped now the noise is redoubled
$lady_bracknell$ i wish he would arrive at some conclusion $gwendolen$ this suspense is terrible i hope it will last enter $uncle_jack$ with a #hand# #bag# of black leather in his #hand#
$uncle_jack$ rushing over to miss prism is this the #hand# #bag# miss prism examine it carefully before you speak the happiness of more than #one# #life# depends on your answer
miss prism calmly it seems to be mine yes here is the injury it received through the upsetting of a gower street omnibus in younger and happier #day#
here is the stain on the lining caused by the explosion of a temperance beverage an incident that occurred at leamington
and here on the lock are my initials i had forgotten that in an extravagant mood i had had them placed there
the #bag# is undoubtedly mine i am delighted to have it so unexpectedly restored to me it has been a great inconvenience being without it all these #year#
$uncle_jack$ in a pathetic voice miss prism more is restored to you than this #hand# #bag# i was the baby you placed in it
miss prism amazed you $uncle_jack$ embracing her yes mother miss prism recoiling in indignant astonishment $mr_ernest_worthing$ i am unmarried
$uncle_jack$ unmarried i do not deny that is a serious blow but after all who has the right to cast a stone against #one# who has suffered
cannot repentance wipe out an act of folly why should there be #one# law for #man# and another for #woman# mother i forgive you
tries to embrace her again miss prism still more indignant $mr_ernest_worthing$ there is some error pointing to $lady_bracknell$ there is the lady who can tell you who you really are
$uncle_jack$ after a pause $lady_bracknell$ i hate to seem inquisitive but would you kindly inform me who i am $lady_bracknell$
i am afraid that the news i have to give you will not altogether please you you are the son of my poor sister mrs $algernon_moncrieff$ and consequently $algernon_moncrieff$ elder #brother#
$uncle_jack$ algy elder #brother# then i have a #brother# after all i knew i had a #brother# i always said i had a #brother#
$miss_cecily_cardew$ how could you have ever doubted that i had a #brother# seizes hold of $algernon_moncrieff$ $dr_chasuble$ my unfortunate #brother# miss prism my unfortunate #brother#
$gwendolen$ my unfortunate #brother# algy you young scoundrel you will have to treat me with more respect in the future you have never behaved to me like a #brother# in all your #life#
$algernon_moncrieff$ well not till to #day# old boy i admit i did my best however though i was out of practice shakes #hand#
$gwendolen$ to $uncle_jack$ my own but what own are you what is your christian #name# now that you have become some #one# else
$uncle_jack$ good heavens i had quite forgotten that point your decision on the subject of my #name# is irrevocable i suppose
$gwendolen$ i never change except in my affections $miss_cecily_cardew$ what a noble nature you have $gwendolen$ $uncle_jack$ then the question had better be cleared up at once
aunt augusta a #moment# at the #time# when miss prism left me in the #hand# #bag# had i been christened already $lady_bracknell$
every luxury that money could buy including christening had been lavished on you by your fond and doting parents $uncle_jack$ then i was christened
that is settled now what #name# was i given let me know the worst $lady_bracknell$ being the eldest son you were naturally christened after your father
$uncle_jack$ irritably yes but what was my father christian #name# $lady_bracknell$ meditatively i cannot at the present #moment# recall what the general christian #name# was
but i have no doubt he had #one# he was eccentric i admit but only in later #year# and that was the result of the indian climate and marriage and indigestion and other #thing# of that kind
$uncle_jack$ algy cant you recollect what our father christian #name# was $algernon_moncrieff$ my dear boy we were never even on speaking terms
