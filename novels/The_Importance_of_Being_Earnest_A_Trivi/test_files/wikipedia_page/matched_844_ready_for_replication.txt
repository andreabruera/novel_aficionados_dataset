byoscar wildedate premieredplace premieredst james theatre london englandoriginal languageenglishgenrecomedy farcesettinglondon and an estate in hertfordshire the importance of being earnest trivial comedy for serious people is play by oscar wilde
first performed on february at the st james theatre in london it is farcical comedy in which the protagonists maintain fictitious personæ to escape burdensome social obligations
working within the social conventions of late victorian london the play major themes are the triviality with which it treats institutions as serious as marriage and the resulting satire of victorian ways
some contemporary reviews praised the play humour and the culmination of wilde artistic career while others were cautious about its lack of social messages
its high farce and witty dialogue have helped make the importance of being earnest wilde most enduringly popular play the successful opening night marked the climax of wilde career but also heralded his downfall
the marquess of queensberry whose son lord alfred douglas was wilde lover planned to present the writer with bouquet of rotten vegetables and disrupt the show
their feud came to climax in court where wilde homosexuality was revealed to the victorian public and he was sentenced to imprisonment
wilde was tipped off and queensberry was refused admission despite the play early success wilde notoriety caused the play to be closed after performances
after his release from prison he published the play from exile in paris but he wrote no further comic or dramatic #work#
the importance of being earnest has been revived many #time# since its premiere it has been adapted for the cinema on three occasions

after the success of wilde plays lady windermere fan and woman of no importance wilde producers urged him to write further plays
in july he mooted his idea for the importance of being earnest to george alexander the actor manager of the st james theatre
woolton wilde spent the summer with his family at $mr_ernest_worthing$ where he wrote the play quickly in august his fame now at its peak he used the working title lady lancing to avoid preemptive speculation of its content
many #name# and ideas in the play were borrowed from people or places the author had known lady queensberry lord alfred douglas mother for example lived at bracknell
from which wilde borrowed not only several incidents but also the gravity of tone demanded by gilbert of his actors wilde continually revised the text over the next months
no line was left untouched and the revision had significant consequences sos eltis describes wilde revisions as refined art at #work#
the earliest and longest handwritten drafts of the play labour over farcical incidents broad puns nonsense dialogue and conventional comic turns
in revising wilde transformed standard nonsense into the more systemic and disconcerting illogicality which characterises earnest dialogue richard ellmann argues wilde had reached his artistic maturity and wrote more surely and rapidly
wilde hesitated about submitting the script to alexander worrying it might be unsuitable for the st james theatre whose typical repertoire was more serious and explaining it had been written in response to request for play with no real serious interest
after working with wilde on stage movements with toy theatre alexander asked the author to shorten the play from four acts to three
when henry james guy domville failed alexander agreed to put on wilde play wilde agreed and combined elements of the second and third acts
the largest cut was the removal of the character of mr gribsby solicitor who comes from london to arrest the profligate $mr_ernest_worthing$ i $uncle_jack$ for unpaid dining bills
the four act version was first played on bbc radio production and is still sometimes performed some consider the three act structure more effective and theatrically resonant than the expanded published edition

the play was first produced at the st james theatre on valentine day it was freezing cold but wilde arrived dressed in florid sobriety wearing green carnation
the audience according to one report included many members of the great and good former cabinet ministers and privy councillors as well as actors writers academics and enthusiasts
the marquess of queensberry the father of wilde lover lord alfred douglas who was on holiday in algiers at the #time# had planned to disrupt the play by throwing bouquet of rotten vegetables at the playwright when he took his bow at the end of the show
wilde and alexander learned of the plan and the latter cancelled queensberry ticket and arranged for policemen to bar his entrance
nevertheless he continued harassing wilde who eventually launched private prosecution against the peer for criminal libel triggering series of trials ending in wilde imprisonment for gross indecency
alexander tried unsuccessfully to save the production by removing wilde #name# from the billing but the play had to close after only performances
aynesworth was himself debonair and stylish and alexander who played $uncle_jack$ $mr_ernest_worthing$ demure the play original broadway production opened at the empire theatre on april but closed after sixteen performances
its cast included william faversham as algy henry miller as $uncle_jack$ viola allen as $gwendolen$ and ida vernon as $lady_bracknell$
the australian premiere was in melbourne on august presented by dion boucicault jr and robert brough and the play was an immediate success
wilde downfall in england did not affect the popularity of his plays in australia reviewers of the premiere clockwise from top left william archer a walkley g wells and george bernard shaw
in contrast to much theatre of the #time# the light plot of the importance of being earnest does not tackle serious social and political issues something of which contemporary reviewers were wary
george bernard shaw for example reviewed the play in the saturday review arguing that comedy should touch as well as amuse i go to the theatre to be moved to laughter
though unsure of wilde seriousness as dramatist they recognised the play cleverness humour and popularity with audiences later in letter he said the play though extremely funny was wilde first really heartless
in the world william archer wrote that he had enjoyed watching the play but found it to be empty of meaning what can poor critic do with play which raises no principle whether of art or morals creates its own canons and conventions and is nothing but an absolutely wilful expression of an irrepressibly witty personality
he denied the term farce was derogatory or even lacking in seriousness and said it is of nonsense all compact and better nonsense think our stage has not seen
h wells in an unsigned review for the pall mall gazette called earnest one of the freshest comedies of the year saying more humorous dealing with theatrical conventions it would be difficult to imagine
he also questioned whether people would fully see its message how serious people will take this trivial comedy intended for their learning remains to be seen
b walkley admired the play and was one of few to see it as the culmination of wilde dramatic career the play was so light hearted that many reviewers compared it to comic opera rather than drama
mary mccarthy in sights and spectacles however and despite thinking the play extremely funny called it a ferocious idyll depravity is the hero and the only character
called it a pure verbal opera and the #time# commented the story is almost too preposterous to go without music the importance of being earnest is wilde most popular #work# and is continually revived
lady windermere fan woman of no importance and an ideal husband the plot following the manner of victorien sardou is unrelated to the theme of the #work# while in earnest the story is dissolved into the form of the play
max beerbohm called the play wilde finest most undeniably his own saying that in his other comedies the importance of being earnest and wilde

the play returned to the west end when alexander presented revival at the st james in each production running for six weeks
a collected edition of wilde #work# published in and edited by robert ross helped to restore his reputation as an author
alexander presented another revival of earnest at the st james in when he and aynesworth reprised their original roles the revival ran for performances
max beerbohm said that the play was sure to become classic of the english repertory and that its humour was as fresh then as when it had been written adding that the actors had worn as well as the play

$algernon_moncrieff$ confesses similar deception he pretends to have an invalid friend named $mr_bunbury$ in the country whom he can visit whenever he wishes to avoid an unwelcome social obligation
in the city meanwhile he assumes the identity of the libertine $mr_ernest_worthing$ $uncle_jack$ refuses to tell $algernon_moncrieff$ the location of his country estate
$gwendolen$ and her formidable mother $lady_bracknell$ now call on $algernon_moncrieff$ who distracts $lady_bracknell$ in another room while $uncle_jack$ proposes to $gwendolen$
she accepts but seems to love him in large part because of his #name# $mr_ernest_worthing$ $uncle_jack$ accordingly resolves to himself to be rechristened $mr_ernest_worthing$

he arrives in full mourning and announces his #brother# death in paris of severe chill story undermined by $algernon_moncrieff$ presence in the guise of $mr_ernest_worthing$

the impasse is broken by the return of miss prism whom $lady_bracknell$ recognises as the person who years earlier as family nursemaid had taken baby boy for walk in perambulator and never returned
challenged miss prism explains that she had absentmindedly put the manuscript of novel she was writing in the perambulator and the baby in handbag which she had left at victoria station
$uncle_jack$ produces the very same handbag showing that he is the lost baby the elder son of $lady_bracknell$ late sister and thus $algernon_moncrieff$ elder #brother#

arthur ransome described the importance as the most trivial of wilde society plays and the only one that produces that peculiar exhilaration of the spirit by which we recognise the beautiful
the reverend canon chasuble the priest of $uncle_jack$ parish it is he wrote precisely because it is consistently trivial that it is not ugly
ellmann says that the importance of being earnest touched on many themes wilde had been building since the the languor of aesthetic poses was well established and wilde takes it as starting point for the two protagonists
while salome an ideal husband and the picture of dorian gray had dwelt on more serious wrongdoing vice in earnest is represented by algy craving for cucumber sandwiches
wilde told robert ross that the play theme was that we should treat all trivial #thing# in #life# very seriously and all serious #thing# of #life# with sincere and studied triviality
the theme is hinted at in the play ironic title and earnestness is repeatedly alluded to in the dialogue $algernon_moncrieff$ says in act ii one has to be serious about something if one is to have any amusement in #life# but goes on to reproach $uncle_jack$ for being serious about everything
blackmail and corruption had haunted the double #life# of dorian gray and sir robert chiltern in an ideal husband but in earnest the protagonists duplicity $algernon_moncrieff$ bunburying and
$mr_ernest_worthing$ double #life# as $uncle_jack$ and $mr_ernest_worthing$ is undertaken for more innocent purposes largely to avoid unwelcome social obligations while much theatre of the #time# tackled serious social and political issues earnest is superficially about nothing at all
it refuses to play the game of other dramatists of the period for instance bernard shaw who used their characters to draw audiences to grander ideals
in victorian #time# earnestness was considered to be the over riding societal value originating in religious attempts to reform the lower classes it spread to the upper ones too throughout the century
the play very title with its mocking paradox serious people are so because they do not see trivial comedies introduces the theme it continues in the drawing room discussion
the play repeatedly mocks victorian traditions and social customs marriage and the pursuit of love in particular yes but you must be serious about it
i hate people who are not serious about meals it is so shallow of them says $algernon_moncrieff$ in act allusions are quick and from multiple angles
$gwendolen$ and $miss_cecily_cardew$ discover that they are both engaged to $mr_ernest_worthing$ wilde managed both to engage with and to mock the genre while providing social commentary and offering reform
the men follow traditional matrimonial rites whereby suitors admit their weaknesses to their prospective brides but the foibles they excuse are ridiculous and the farce is built on an absurd confusion of book and baby
$gwendolen$ it is terrible #thing# for man to find out suddenly that all his #life# he has been speaking nothing but the truth
in turn both $gwendolen$ and $miss_cecily_cardew$ have the ideal of marrying man named $mr_ernest_worthing$ popular and respected #name# at the #time#
$gwendolen$ quite unlike her mother methodical analysis of john $mr_ernest_worthing$ suitability as husband places her entire faith in christian #name# declaring in act i the only really safe #name# is $mr_ernest_worthing$
$uncle_jack$ for feel that you are sure to change and they indignantly declare that they have been deceived when they find out the men real #name#
wilde embodied society rules and rituals artfully into $lady_bracknell$ minute attention to the details of her style created comic effect of assertion by restraint
in contrast to her encyclopaedic knowledge of the social distinctions of london street #name# $uncle_jack$ obscure parentage is subtly evoked he defends himself against her a handbag with the clarification the brighton line
at the #time# victoria station consisted of two separate but adjacent terminal stations sharing the same #name# to the east was the ramshackle lc railway on the west the up market
lb scr the brighton line which went to $mr_ernest_worthing$ the fashionable expensive town the gentleman who found baby $uncle_jack$ was travelling to at the #time# and after which $uncle_jack$ was named
it has been argued that the play themes of duplicity and ambivalence are inextricably bound up with wilde homosexuality and that the play exhibits flickering presence absence of homosexual desire
on re reading the play after his release from prison wilde said it was extraordinary reading the play over how used to toy with that tiger #life#
as one scholar has put it the absolute necessity for homosexuals of the period to need public mask is factor contributing to the satire on social disguise
in three years before wilde wrote the play john gambril nicholson had published the book of pederastic poetry love in earnest
the use of the #name# earnest may have been homosexual in joke the sonnet of boys #name# included the verse though frank may ring like silver bell
and cecil softer music claim they cannot #work# the miracle tis $mr_ernest_worthing$ sets my heart a flame the word earnest may also have been code word for homosexual as in is he earnest
sir donald sinden an actor who had met two of the play original cast irene vanbrugh and allan aynesworth and lord alfred douglas wrote to the #time# to dispute suggestions that earnest held any sexual connotations
although they had ample opportunity at no #time# did any of them even hint that earnest was synonym for homosexual or that bunburying may have implied homosexual sex
the first #time# heard it mentioned was in the and immediately consulted sir john gielgud whose own performance of $uncle_jack$ $mr_ernest_worthing$ in the same play was legendary and whose knowledge of theatrical lore was encyclopaedic
in the same #way# that is he so he replied in his ringing tones no no nonsense absolute nonsense would have known
a number of theories have also been put forward to explain the derivation of $mr_bunbury$ and bunburying which are used in the play to imply secretive double #life#
another suggestion put forward in by aleister crowley who knew wilde was that $mr_bunbury$ was combination word that wilde had once taken train to banbury met schoolboy there and arranged second secret meeting with him at sunbury
it may have derived from henry shirley $mr_bunbury$ hypochondriacal acquaintance of wilde youth bunburying is stratagem used by people who need an excuse for avoiding social obligations in their daily #life#
the word bunburying first appears in act when $algernon_moncrieff$ explains that he invented fictional friend chronic invalid named $mr_bunbury$ to have an excuse for getting out of events he does not wish to attend particularly with his aunt augusta $lady_bracknell$
while wilde had long been famous for dialogue and his use of language raby argues that he achieved unity and mastery in earnest that was unmatched in his other plays except perhaps salomé
while his earlier comedies suffer from an unevenness resulting from the thematic clash between the trivial and the serious earnest achieves pitch perfect style that allows these to dissolve
$algernon_moncrieff$ and $uncle_jack$ both use this method to secretly visit their lovers $miss_cecily_cardew$ and $gwendolen$ there are three different registers detectable in the play
the dandyish insouciance of $uncle_jack$ and $algernon_moncrieff$ established early with $algernon_moncrieff$ exchange with his manservant betrays an underlying unity despite their differing attitudes
the formidable pronouncements of $lady_bracknell$ are as startling for her use of hyperbole and rhetorical extravagance as for her disconcerting opinions
in contrast the speech of $dr_chasuble$ and miss prism is distinguished by pedantic precept and idiosyncratic diversion furthermore the play is full of epigrams and paradoxes
max beerbohm described it as littered with chiselled apophthegms witticisms unrelated to action or character of which he found half dozen to be of the highest order
has been called one of the most malleable in english drama lending itself to interpretations ranging from incredulous or scandalised to baffled
stockard channing in the gaiety theatre dublin in hushed the line in critic words with barely audible a handbag rapidly swallowed up with sharp intake of breath
an understated take to be sure but with such well known play packed full of witticisms and aphorisms with #life# of their own it the little #thing# that make difference
edith evans both on stage and in the film delivered the line loudly in mixture of horror incredulity and condescension though wilde deployed characters that were by now familiar
the dandy lord the overbearing matriarch the woman with past the puritan young lady his treatment is subtler than in his earlier comedies
$lady_bracknell$ for instance embodies respectable upper class society but eltis notes how her development from the familiar overbearing duchess into quirkier and more disturbing character can be traced through wilde revisions of the play
for the two young men wilde presents not stereotypical stage dudes but intelligent beings who as jackson puts it speak like their creator in well formed complete sentences and rarely use slang or vogue words
$dr_chasuble$ and miss prism are characterised by few light touches of detail their old fashioned enthusiasms and the canon fastidious pedantry pared down by wilde during his many redrafts of the text
ransome argues that wilde freed himself by abandoning the melodrama the basic structure which underlies his earlier social comedies and basing the story entirely on the earnest $mr_ernest_worthing$ verbal conceit
freed from living up to any drama more serious than conversation wilde could now amuse himself to fuller extent with quips bons mots epigrams and repartee that really had little to do with the business at #hand#
the genre of the importance of being earnest has been deeply debated by scholars and critics alike who have placed the play within wide variety of genres ranging from parody to satire
in his critique of wilde foster argues that the play creates world where real values are inverted reason and unreason are interchanged
reinhart further stipulates that the use of farcical humour to mock the upper classes merits the play both as satire and as drama
to robert baldwin ross in appreciation in affection dedication of the importance of being earnest wilde two final comedies an ideal husband and the importance of being earnest were still on stage in london at the #time# of his prosecution and they were soon closed as the details of his case became public
after two years in prison with hard labour wilde went into exile in paris sick and depressed his reputation destroyed in england
similarly wilde use of dialogue mocks the upper classes of victorian england lending the play satirical tone in when no one else would leonard smithers agreed with wilde to publish the two final plays
wilde proved to be diligent reviser sending detailed instructions on stage directions character listings and the presentation of the book and insisting that playbill from the first performance be reproduced inside
ellmann argues that the proofs show man very much in command of himself and of the play wilde #name# did not appear on the cover it was by the author of lady windermere fan
his return to #work# was brief though as he refused to write anything else i can write but have lost the joy of writing
on october a first edition number of was discovered inside handbag in an oxfam shop in nantwich cheshire staff were unable to trace the donor
the importance of being earnest popularity has meant it has been translated into many languages though the homophonous pun in the title $mr_ernest_worthing$ masculine proper #name# and earnest the virtue of steadfastness and seriousness poses special problem for translators
the easiest case of suitable translation of the pun perpetuating its sense and meaning may have been its translation into german
since english and german are closely related languages german provides an equivalent adjective ernst and also matching masculine proper #name# ernst
the meaning and tenor of the wordplay are exactly the same yet there are many different possible titles in german mostly concerning sentence structure
the two most common ones are $mr_bunbury$ oder ernst ernst sein ist alles and $mr_bunbury$ oder wie wichtig es ist ernst ernst zu sein
since wordplay is often unique to the language in question translators are faced with choice of either staying faithful to the original in this case the english adjective and virtue earnest or creating similar pun in their own language
in study of italian translations adrian pablé found thirteen different versions using eight titles wilde drawn in by henri de toulouse lautrec four main strategies have been used by translators
the first leaves all characters #name# unchanged and in their original spelling thus the #name# is respected and readers reminded of the original cultural setting but the liveliness of the pun is lost
eva malagoli varied this source oriented approach by using both the english christian #name# and the adjective earnest thus preserving the pun and the english character of the play but possibly straining an italian reader
third group of translators replaced $mr_ernest_worthing$ with #name# that also represents virtue in the target language favouring transparency for readers in translation over fidelity to the original
for instance in italian these versions variously call the play importanza di essere franco severo fedele the given #name# being respectively the values of honesty propriety and loyalty
french offers closer pun constant is both first #name# and the quality of steadfastness so the play is commonly known as de importance être constant though jean anouilh translated the play under the title il est important être aimé aimé is #name# which also means beloved
these translators differ in their attitude to the original english honorific titles some change them all or none but most leave mix partially as compensation for the added loss of englishness
lastly one translation gave the #name# an italianate touch by rendering it as ernesto this #work# liberally mixed proper nouns from both languages
