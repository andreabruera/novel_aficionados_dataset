produced by david reed and karol pietrzak dubliners by james joyce contents the sister an encounter araby eveline after the race two gallants
the boarding house a little cloud counterparts clay a painful case ivy day in the committee room a mother grace the dead dubliners
night after night i had passed the house it was vacation time and studied the lighted square of window and night after night i had found it lighted in the same way faintly and evenly
if he was dead i thought i would see the reflection of candle on the darkened blind for i knew that two candle must be set at the head of a corpse
the sister there was no hope for him this time it was the third stroke he had often said to me i am not long for this world and i had thought his word idle
now i knew they were true every night as i gazed up at the window i said softly to myself the word paralysis
it had always sounded strangely in my ear like the word gnomon in the euclid and the word simony in the catechism
it filled me with fear and yet i longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work
but now it sounded to me like the name of some maleficent and sinful being old mr_cotter was sitting at the fire smoking when i came downstairs to supper
while my aunt was ladling out my stirabout he said as if returning to some former remark of his no i wouldnt say he was exactly
but there was something queer there was something uncanny about him i ll tell you my opinion he began to puff at his pipe no doubt arranging his opinion in his mind
when we knew him first he used to be rather interesting talking of faints and worms but i soon grew tired of him and his endless story about the distillery
tiresome old fool i have my own theory about it he said i think it was one of those peculiar case
my uncle saw me staring and said to me well so your old friend is gone you ll be sorry to hear
but it hard to say he began to puff again at his pipe without giving us his theory who said i father flynn
is he dead mr_cotter here has just told us he was passing by the house i knew that i was under observation
so i continued eating as if the news had not interested me my uncle explained to old mr_cotter the youngster and he were great friend
the old chap taught him a great deal mind you and they say he had a great wish for him
god have mercy on his soul said my aunt piously old mr_cotter looked at me for a while i felt that his little beady black eye were examining me
but i would not satisfy him by looking up from my plate he returned to his pipe and finally spat rudely into the grate
i wouldnt like child of mine he said to have too much to say to a man like that how do you mean mr_cotter asked my aunt
my idea is let a young lad run about and play with young lads of his own age and not be
what i mean is said old mr_cotter it bad for child am i right jack_mooney that my principle too said my uncle
let him learn to box his corner that what i always saying to that rosicrucian there take exercise why when i was a nipper every morning of my life i had a cold bath winter and summer
and that what stands to me now education is all very fine and large mr_cotter might take a pick of that leg mutton he added to my aunt
no no not for me said old mr_cotter my aunt brought the dish from the safe and put it on the table
but why do you think it not good for child mr_cotter she asked it bad for child said old mr_cotter because their mind are so impressionable
when child see thing like that you know it has an effect i crammed my mouth with stirabout for fear i might give utterance to my anger
though i was angry with old mr_cotter for alluding to me as a child i puzzled my head to extract meaning from his unfinished sentences
tiresome old red nosed imbecile it was late when i fell asleep in the dark of my room i imagined that i saw again the heavy grey face of the paralytic
i drew the blankets over my head and tried to think of christmas but the grey face still followed me it murmured and i understood that it desired to confess something
it began to confess to me in a murmuring voice and i wondered why it smiled continually and why the lip were so moist with spittle
i felt my soul receding into some pleasant and vicious region and there again i found it waiting for me but then i remembered that it had died of paralysis
and i felt that i too was smiling feebly as if to absolve the simoniac of his sin the next morning after breakfast i went down to look at the little house in great britain street
the drapery consisted mainly of child bootees and umbrellas and on ordinary day a notice used to hang in the window saying umbrellas re covered
it was an unassuming shop registered under the vague name of drapery no notice was visible now for the shutters were up
a crape bouquet was tied to the doork nocker with ribbon two poor woman and a telegram boy were reading the card pinned on the crape
i also approached and read july st the rev james flynn formerly of catherine church meath street aged sixty five year
r i the reading of the card persuaded me that he was dead and i was disturbed to find myself at check
had he not been dead i would have gone into the little dark room behind the shop to find him sitting in his arm chair by the fire nearly smothered in his great coat
perhaps my aunt would have given me a packet of high toast for him and this present would have roused him from his stupefied doze
it was always i who emptied the packet into his black snuff box for his hand trembled too much to allow him to do this without spilling half the snuff about the floor
even as he raised his large trembling hand to his nose little clouds of smoke dribbled through his finger over the front of his coat
it may have been these constant showers of snuff which gave his ancient priestly garments their green faded look for the red handkerchief blackened as it always was with the snuff stains of a week with which he tried to brush away the fallen grains was quite inefficacious
i walked away slowly along the sunny side of the street reading all the theatrical advertisements in the shopwindows as i went
i found it strange that neither i nor the day seemed in a mourning mood and i felt even annoyed at discovering in myself a sensation of freedom as if i had been freed from something by his death
i wished to go in and look at him but i had not the courage to knock i wondered at this for as my uncle had said the night before he had taught me a great deal
he had told me story about the catacombs and about napoleon bonaparte and he had explained to me the meaning of the different ceremonies of the mass and of the different vestments worn by the priest
sometimes he had amused himself by putting difficult question to me asking me what one should do in certain circumstances or whether such and such sins were mortal or venial or only imperfections
his question showed me how complex and mysterious were certain institutions of the church which i had always regarded as the simplest acts
the duties of the priest towards the eucharist and towards the secrecy of the confessional seemed so grave to me that i wondered how anybody had ever found in himself the courage to undertake them and i was not surprised when he told me that the father of the church had written book as thick as the post office directory and as closely printed as the law notices in the newspaper elucidating all these intricate question
often when i thought of this i could make no answer or only a very foolish and halting one upon which he used to smile and nod his head twice or thrice
sometimes he used to put me through the responses of the mass which he had made me learn by heart and as i pattered he used to smile pensively and nod his head now and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alternately
when he smiled he used to uncover his big discoloured teeth and let his tongue lie upon his lower lip a habit which had made me feel uneasy in the beginning of our acquaintance before i knew him well
as i walked along in the sun i remembered old mr_cotter word and tried to remember what had happened afterwards in the dream
he had studied in the irish college in rome and he had taught me to pronounce latin properly i remembered that i had noticed long velvet curtains and a swinging lamp of antique fashion
i felt that i had been very far away in some land where the customs were strange in persia i thought but i could not remember the end of the dream
it was after sunset but the window panes of the house that looked to the west reflected the tawny gold of a great bank of clouds
nannie received us in the hall and as it would have been unseemly to have shouted at her my aunt shook hand with her for all
the old woman pointed upwards interrogatively and on my aunt nodding proceeded to toil up the narrow staircase before us her bowed head being scarcely above the level of the banister rail
in the evening my aunt took me with her to visit the house of mourning at the first landing she stopped and beckoned us forward encouragingly towards the open door of the dead room
my aunt went in and the old woman seeing that i hesitated to enter began to beckon to me again repeatedly with her hand
the room through the lace end of the blind was suffused with dusky golden light amid which the candle looked like pale thin flames
i went in on tiptoe he had been coffined nannie gave the lead and we three knelt down at the foot of the bed
i pretended to pray but i could not gather my thought because the old woman mutterings distracted me i noticed how clumsily her skirt was hooked at the back and
how the heels of her cloth boots were trodden down all to one side the fancy came to me that the old priest was smiling as he lay there in his coffin
but no when we rose and went up to the head of the bed i saw that he was not smiling
there he lay solemn and copious vested as for the altar his large hand loosely retaining a chalice his face was very truculent grey and massive with black cavernous nostrils and circled by a scanty white fur
there was a heavy odour in the room the flowers we blessed ourselves and came away in the little room downstairs we found eliza seated in his arm chair in state
i groped my way towards my usual chair in the corner while nannie went to the sideboard and brought out a decanter of sherry and some wine glass
she set these on the table and invited us to take a little glass of wine then at her sister bidding she filled out the sherry into the glass and passed them to us
she pressed me to take some cream crackers also but i declined because i thought i would make too much noise eating them
she seemed to be somewhat disappointed at my refusal and went over quietly to the sofa where she sat down behind her sister
no one spoke we all gazed at the empty fireplace my aunt waited until eliza sighed and then said ah well he gone to a better world
eliza sighed again and bowed her head in assent my aunt fingered the stem of her wine glass before sipping a little
did he peacefully she asked oh quite peacefully ma am said eliza you couldnt tell when the breath went out of him
he had a beautiful death god be praised and everything father rourke was in with him a tuesday and anointed him and prepared him and all
he knew then he was quite resigned he looks quite resigned said my aunt that what the woman we had in to wash him said
she said he just looked as if he was asleep he looked that peaceful and resigned no one would think he make such a beautiful corpse
she sipped a little more from her glass and said well miss flynn at any rate it must be a great comfort for you to know that you did all you could for him
yes indeed said my aunt you were both very kind to him i must say eliza smoothed her dress over her knees
god knows we done all we could as poor as we are we wouldnt see him want anything while he was in it
ah poor james she said nannie had leaned her head against the sofa pillow and seemed about to fall asleep
all the work we had she and me getting in the woman to wash him and then laying him out and then the coffin and then arranging about the mass in the chapel
there poor nannie said eliza looking at her she wore out only for father rourke i dont know what we have done at all
it was him brought us all them flowers and them two candlesticks out of the chapel and wrote out the notice for the freeman general and took charge of all the paper for the cemetery and poor james insurance
ah there no friend like the old friend she said when all is said and done no friend that a body can trust
wasnt that good of him said my aunt eliza closed her eye and shook her head slowly indeed that true said my aunt
and i sure now that he gone to his eternal reward he wont forget you and all your kindness to him
ah poor james said eliza he was no great trouble to us you wouldnt hear him in the house any more than now
still i know he gone and all to that it when it all over that you ll miss him said my aunt
i know that said eliza i wont be bringing him in his cup of beef tea any more nor you ma am sending him his snuff
ah poor james she stopped as if she were communing with the past and then said shrewdly mind you i noticed there was something queer coming over him latterly
whenever i bring in his soup to him there i find him with his breviary fallen to the floor lying back in the chair and his mouth open
she laid a finger against her nose and frowned then she continued but still and all he kept on saying that before the summer was over he go out for a drive one fine day just to see the old house again where we were all born down in irishtown and take me and nannie with him
if we could only get one of them new fangled carriages that makes no noise that father rourke told him about them with the rheumatic wheels for the day cheap he said at johnny rush over the way there and drive out the three of us together of a sunday evening
he had his mind set on that poor james the lord have mercy on his soul said my aunt
eliza took out her handkerchief and wiped her eye with it then she put it back again in her pocket and gazed into the empty grate for some time without speaking
he was too scrupulous always she said the duties of the priesthood was too much for him and then his life was you might say crossed
a silence took possession of the little room and under cover of it i approached the table and tasted my sherry and then returned quietly to my chair in the comer
yes said my aunt he was a disappointed man you could see that eliza seemed to have fallen into a deep revery
we waited respectfully for her to break the silence and after a long pause she said slowly it was that chalice he broke
that was the beginning of it of course they say it was all right that it contained nothing i mean but still they say it was the boy fault
but poor james was so nervous god be merciful to him and was that it said my aunt
i heard something eliza nodded that affected his mind she said after that he began to mope by himself talking to no one and wandering about by himself
so one night he was wanted for to go on a call and they couldnt find him anywhere they looked high up and low down and still they couldnt see a sight of him anywhere
so then they got the keys and opened the chapel and the clerk and father rourke and another priest that was there brought in a light for to look for him
so then the clerk suggested to try the chapel and what do you think but there he was sitting up by himself in the dark in his confession box wide awake and laughing like softly to himself
i too listened but there was no sound in the house and i knew that the old priest was lying still in his coffin as we had seen him solemn and truculent in death an idle chalice on his breast
she stopped suddenly as if to listen eliza resumed wide awake and laughing like to himself so then of course when they saw that that made them think that there was something gone wrong with him
an encounter it was joe_dillon who introduced the wild west to us he had a little library made up of old numbers of the union jack_mooney pluck and the halfpenny marvel
he and his fat young brother leo_dillon the idler held the loft of the stable while we tried to carry it by storm or we fought a pitched battle on the grass
but however well we fought we never won siege or battle and all our bouts ended with joe_dillon war dance of victory
his parents went to eight clock mass every morning in gardiner street and the peaceful odour of mrs leo_dillon was prevalent in the hall of the house
every evening after school we met in his back garden and arranged indian battles but he played too fiercely for us who were younger and more timid
he looked like some kind of an indian when he capered round the garden an old tea cosy on his head beating a tin with his fist and yelling
ya yaka yaka yaka everyone was incredulous when it was reported that he had a vocation for the priesthood nevertheless it was true
we banded ourselves together some boldly some in jest and some almost in fear and of the number of these latter the reluctant indians who were afraid to seem studious or lacking in robustness i was one
the adventures related in the literature of the wild west were remote from my nature but at least they opened door of escape
a spirit of unruliness diffused itself among us and under its influence differences of culture and constitution were waived i liked better some american detective story which were traversed from time to time by unkempt fierce and beautiful girl
though there was nothing wrong in these story and though their intention was sometimes literary they were circulated secretly at school
one day when father butler was hearing the four pages of roman history clumsy leo_dillon was discovered with a copy of the halfpenny marvel
this page or this page this page now leo_dillon up hardly had the day go on what day
hardly had the day dawned have you studied it what have you there in your pocket everyone heart palpitated as leo_dillon handed up the paper and everyone assumed an innocent face
father butler turned over the pages frowning what is this rubbish he said the apache chief is this what you read instead of studying your roman history
let me not find any more of this wretched stuff in this college the man who wrote it i suppose was some wretched fellow who writes these thing for a drink
i surprised at boy like you educated reading such stuff i could understand it if you were national school boy now leo_dillon i advise you strongly get at your work or
this rebuke during the sober hour of school paled much of the glory of the wild west for me and the confused puffy face of leo_dillon
but when the restraining influence of the school was at a distance i began to hunger again for wild sensations for the escape which those chronicles of disorder alone seemed to offer me
the mimic warfare of the evening became at last as wearisome to me as the routine of school in the morning because i wanted real adventures to happen to myself
awakened one of my consciences but real adventures i reflected do not happen to people who remain at home they must be sought abroad
the summer holidays were near at hand when i made up my mind to break out of the weariness of school life for one day at least
with leo_dillon and a boy named mahony i planned a day miching each of us saved up sixpence we were to meet at ten in the morning on the canal bridge
mahony big sister was to write an excuse for him and leo_dillon was to tell his brother to say he was sick
we arranged to go along the wharf road until we came to the ships then to cross in the ferryboat and walk out to see the pigeon house
leo_dillon was afraid we might meet father butler or someone out of the college but mahony asked very sensibly what would father butler be doing out at the pigeon house
we were reassured and i brought the first stage of the plot to an end by collecting sixpence from the other two at the same time showing them my own sixpence
when we were making the last arrangements on the eve we were all vaguely excited we shook hand laughing and mahony said till tomorrow mates
i hid my book in the long grass near the ashpit at the end of the garden where nobody ever came and hurried along the canal bank
that night i slept badly in the morning i was first comer to the bridge as i lived nearest it was a mild sunny morning in the first week of june
i sat up on the coping of the bridge admiring my frail canvas shoes which i had diligently pipeclayed overnight and watching the docile horses pulling a tramload of business people up the hill
all the branches of the tall trees which lined the mall were gay with little light green leaves and the sunlight slanted through them on to the water
the granite stone of the bridge was beginning to be warm and i began to pat it with my hand in time to an air in my head
i was very happy when i had been sitting there for five or ten minute i saw mahony grey suit approaching
while we were waiting he brought out the catapult which bulged from his inner pocket and explained some improvements which he had made in it
he came up the hill smiling and clambered up beside me on the bridge i asked him why he had brought it
and he told me he had brought it to have some gas with the birds mahony used slang freely and spoke of father butler as old bunser
we waited on for a quarter of an hour more but still there was no sign of leo_dillon mahony at last jumped down and said come along
i knew fatty funk it and his sixpence i said that forfeit said mahony and so much the better for us a bob and a tanner instead of a bob
we walked along the north strand road till we came to the vitriol work and then turned to the right along the wharf road
he chased a crowd of ragged girl brandishing his unloaded catapult and when two ragged boy began out of chivalry to fling stones at us he proposed that we should charge them
mahony began to play the indian as soon as we were out of public sight i objected that the boy were too small and so we walked on the ragged troop screaming after us
thinking that we were protestants because mahony who was dark complexioned wore the silver badge of a cricket club in his cap
when we came to the smoothing iron we arranged a siege but it was a failure because you must have at least three
we revenged ourselves on leo_dillon by saying what a funk he was and guessing how many he would get at three clock from mr ryan
we spent a long time walking about the noisy street flanked by high stone wall watching the working of cranes and engines and often being shouted at for our immobility by the drivers of groaning carts
it was noon when we reached the quays and as all the labourers seemed to be eating their lunches we bought two big currant buns and sat down to eat them on some metal piping beside the river
we pleased ourselves with the spectacle of dublin commerce the barges signalled from far away by their curls of woolly smoke the brown fishing fleet beyond ringsend the big white sailing vessel which was being discharged on the opposite quay
mahony said it would be right skit to run away to sea on one of those big ships and even i looking at the high masts saw or imagined the geography which had been scantily dosed to me at school gradually taking substance under my eye
swaddlers swaddlers we came then near the river school and home seemed to recede from us and their influences upon us seemed to wane
we crossed the liffey in the ferryboat paying our toll to be transported in the company of two labourers and a little jew with a bag
we were serious to the point of solemnity but once during the short voyage our eye met and we laughed when we landed we watched the discharging of the graceful threemaster which we had observed from the other quay
i went to the stern and tried to decipher the legend upon it but failing to do so i came back and examined the foreign sailors to see had any of them green eye for i had some confused notion
the only sailor whose eye could have been called green was a tall man who amused the crowd on the quay by calling out cheerfully every time the planks fell
some bystander said that she was a norwegian vessel the sailors eye were blue and grey and even black all right
all right when we were tired of this sight we wandered slowly into ringsend the day had grown sultry and in the window of the grocers shop musty biscuits lay bleaching
we bought some biscuits and chocolate which we ate sedulously as we wandered through the squalid street where the families of the fishermen live
we could find no dairy and so we went into a huckster shop and bought a bottle of raspberry lemonade each
we both felt rather tired and when we reached the field we made at once for a sloping bank over the ridge of which we could see the dodder
refreshed by this mahony chased a cat down a lane but the cat escaped into a wide field it was too late and we were too tired to carry out our project of visiting the pigeon house
we had to be home before four clock lest our adventure should be discovered mahony looked regretfully at his catapult and i had to suggest going home by train before he regained any cheerfulness
the sun went in behind some clouds and left us to our jaded thought and the crumbs of our provisions there was nobody but ourselves in the field
when we had lain on the bank for some time without speaking i saw a man approaching from the far end of the field
i watched him lazily as i chewed one of those green stems on which girl tell fortunes he came along by the bank slowly
he walked with one hand upon his hip and in the other hand he held a stick with which he tapped the turf lightly
he was shabbily dressed in a suit of greenish black and wore what we used to call a jerry hat with a high crown
he seemed to be fairly old for his moustache was ashen grey when he passed at our foot he glanced up at us quickly and then continued his way
we followed him with our eye and saw that when he had gone on for perhaps fifty paces he turned about and began to retrace his step
he walked towards us very slowly always tapping the ground with his stick so slowly that i thought he was looking for something in the grass
he stopped when he came level with us and bade us good day we answered him and he sat down beside us on the slope slowly and with great care
he began to talk of the weather saying that it would be a very hot summer and adding that the seasons had changed greatly since he was a boy a long time ago
he said that the happiest time of one life was undoubtedly one school boy day and that he would give anything to be young again
while he expressed these sentiments which bored us a little we kept silent then he began to talk of school and of book
he asked us whether we had read the poetry of thomas moore or the work of sir walter scott and lord lytton
i pretended that i had read every book he mentioned so that in the end he said ah i can see you are a bookworm like myself
now he added pointing to mahony who was regarding us with open eye he is different he goes in for game
he said he had all sir walter scott work and all lord lytton work at home and never tired of reading them
mahony asked why couldnt boy read them a question which agitated and pained me because i was afraid the man would think i was as stupid as mahony
of course he said there were some of lord lytton work which boy couldnt read the man however only smiled
i saw that he had great gaps in his mouth between his yellow teeth then he asked us which of us had the most sweethearts
mahony mentioned lightly that he had three totties the man asked me how many had i i answered that i had none
he did not believe me and said he was sure i must have one i was silent tell us said mahony pertly to the man how many have you yourself
the man smiled as before and said that when he was our age he had lots of sweethearts every boy he said has a little sweetheart
his attitude on this point struck me as strangely liberal in a man of his age in my heart i thought that what he said about boy and sweethearts was reasonable
but i disliked the word in his mouth and i wondered why he shivered once or twice as if he feared something or felt a sudden chill
he began to speak to us about girl saying what nice soft hair they had and how soft their hand were and how all girl were not so good as they seemed to be if one only knew
there was nothing he liked he said so much as looking at a nice young girl at her nice white hand and her beautiful soft hair
he gave me the impression that he was repeating something which he had learned by heart or that magnetised by some word of his own speech his mind was slowly circling round and round in the same orbit
at time he spoke as if he were simply alluding to some fact that everybody knew and at time he lowered his voice and spoke mysteriously as if he were telling us something secret which he did not wish other to overhear
as he proceeded i noticed that his accent was good he repeated his phrases over and over again varying them and surrounding them with his monotonous voice
he stood up slowly saying that he had to leave us for a minute or so a few minute and without changing the direction of my gaze i saw him walking slowly away from us towards the near end of the field
i continued to gaze towards the foot of the slope listening to him after a long while his monologue paused we remained silent when he had gone
after a silence of a few minute i heard mahony exclaim i say look what he doing as i neither answered nor raised my eye mahony exclaimed again i say
he a queer old josser in case he asks us for our name i said let you be murphy and i ll be smith
i was still considering whether i would go away or not when the man came back and sat down beside us again
hardly had he sat down when mahony catching sight of the cat which had escaped him sprang up and pursued her across the field
we said nothing further to each other the man and i watched the chase the cat escaped once more and mahony began to throw stones at the wall she had escaladed
desisting from this he began to wander about the far end of the field aimlessly after an interval the man spoke to me
i was going to reply indignantly that we were not national school boy to be whipped as he called it but i remained silent
he said that my friend was a very rough boy and asked did he get whipped often at school he began to speak on the subject of chastising boy
his mind as if magnetised again by his speech seemed to circle slowly round and round its new centre he said that when boy were that kind they ought to be whipped and well whipped
a slap on the hand or a box on the ear was no good what he wanted was to get a nice warm whipping
when a boy was rough and unruly there was nothing would do him any good but a good sound whipping i was surprised at this sentiment and involuntarily glanced up at his face
as i did so i met the gaze of a pair of bottle green eye peering at me from under a twitching forehead
he said that if ever he found a boy talking to girl or having a girl for a sweetheart he would whip him and whip him and that would teach him not to be talking to girl
and if a boy had a girl for a sweetheart and told lies about it then he would give him such a whipping as no boy ever got in this world
i turned my eye away again the man continued his monologue he seemed to have forgotten his recent liberalism he said that there was nothing in this world he would like so well as that
he would love that he said better than anything in this world and his voice as he led me monotonously through the mystery grew almost affectionate and seemed to plead with me that i should understand him
he described to me how he would whip such a boy as if he were unfolding some elaborate mystery i waited till his monologue paused again
then i stood up abruptly lest i should betray my agitation i delayed a few moment pretending to fix my shoe properly and then saying that i was obliged to go
i bade him good day i went up the slope calmly but my heart was beating quickly with fear that he would seize me by the ankles
when i reached the top of the slope i turned round and without looking at him called loudly across the field murphy
my voice had an accent of forced bravery in it and i was ashamed of my paltry stratagem i had to call the name again before mahony saw me and hallooed in answer
how my heart beat as he came running across the field to me he ran as if to bring me aid
araby north richmond street being blind was a quiet street except at the hour when the christian brothers school set the boy free
and i was penitent for in my heart i had always despised him a little an uninhabited house of two storeys stood at the blind end detached from its neighbours in a square ground
the other house of the street conscious of decent life within them gazed at one another with brown imperturbable face the former tenant of our house a priest had died in the back drawing room
air musty from having been long enclosed hung in all the room and the waste room behind the kitchen was littered with old useless paper
among these i found a few paper covered book the pages of which were curled and damp the abbot by walter scott the devout communicant and the memoirs of vidocq
the wild garden behind the house contained a central apple tree and a few straggling bushes under one of which i found the late tenant rusty bicycle pump
he had been a very charitable priest in his will he had left all his money to institutions and the furniture of his house to his sister
i liked the last best because its leaves were yellow when the short day of winter came dusk fell before we had well eaten our dinner
the space of sky above us was the colour of ever changing violet and towards it the lamp of the street lifted their feeble lanterns
when we met in the street the house had grown sombre the cold air stung us and we played till our body glowed
the career of our play brought us through the dark muddy lanes behind the house where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes from the cottages to the back door of the dark dripping gardens where odours arose from the ashpits to the dark odorous stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled harness
our shouts echoed in the silent street when we returned to the street light from the kitchen window had filled the areas
or if mangan sister came out on the doorstep to call her brother in to his tea we watched her from our shadow peer up and down the street
we waited to see whether she would remain or go in and if she remained we left our shadow and walked up to mangan step resignedly
if my uncle was seen turning the corner we hid in the shadow until we had seen him safely housed she was waiting for us her figure defined by the light from the half opened door
her brother always teased her before he obeyed and i stood by the railings looking at her her dress swung as she moved her body and the soft rope of her hair tossed from side to side
every morning i lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her door the blind was pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that i could not be seen
when she came out on the doorstep my heart leaped i ran to the hall seized my book and followed her
i kept her brown figure always in my eye and when we came near the point at which our way diverged i quickened my pace and passed her
i had never spoken to her except for a few casual word and yet her name was like a summons to all my foolish blood
this happened morning after morning her image accompanied me even in place the most hostile to romance on saturday evening when my aunt went marketing i had to go to carry some of the parcels
we walked through the flaring street jostled by drunken man and bargaining woman amid the curses of labourers the shrill litanies of shop boy who stood on guard by the barrels of pigs cheeks the nasal chanting of street singers who sang a come all you about donovan rossa or a ballad about the troubles in our native land
these noise converged in a single sensation of life for me i imagined that i bore my chalice safely through a throng of foes
my eye were often full of tears i could not tell why and at time a flood from my heart seemed to pour itself out into my bosom
her name sprang to my lip at moment in strange prayers and praises which i myself did not understand i thought little of the future
i did not know whether i would ever speak to her or not or if i spoke to her how i could tell her of my confused adoration
but my body was like a harp and her word and gestures were like finger running upon the wires one evening i went into the back drawing room in which the priest had died
through one of the broken panes i heard the rain impinge upon the earth the fine incessant needles of water playing in the sodden bed
it was a dark rainy evening and there was no sound in the house some distant lamp or lighted window gleamed below me
all my senses seemed to desire to veil themselves and feeling that i was about to slip from them i pressed the palms of my hand together until they trembled murmuring love
i was thankful that i could see so little love many time at last she spoke to me when she addressed the first word to me
i was so confused that i did not know what to answer she asked me was i going to araby i forgot whether i answered yes or no
it would be a splendid bazaar she said she would love to go and why cant you i asked
while she spoke she turned a silver bracelet round and round her wrist she could not go she said because there would be a retreat that week in her convent
her brother and two other boy were fighting for their caps and i was alone at the railings she held one of the spikes bowing her head towards me
the light from the lamp opposite our door caught the white curve of her neck lit up her hair that rested there and falling lit up the hand upon the railing
it fell over one side of her dress and caught the white border of a petticoat just visible as she stood at ease
it well for you she said if i go i said i will bring you something what innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping thought after that evening
at night in my bedroom and by day in the classroom her image came between me and the page i strove to read
the syllables of the word araby were called to me through the silence in which my soul luxuriated and cast an eastern enchantment over me
i wished to annihilate the tedious intervening day i chafed against the work of school i asked for leave to go to the bazaar on saturday night
my aunt was surprised and hoped it was not some freemason affair i answered few question in class i watched my master face pass from amiability to sternness he hoped i was not beginning to idle
i had hardly any patience with the serious work of life which now that it stood between me and my desire seemed to me child play ugly monotonous child play
i could not call my wandering thought together on saturday morning i reminded my uncle that i wished to go to the bazaar in the evening
he was fussing at the hallstand looking for the hat brush and answered me curtly yes boy i know as he was in the hall i could not go into the front parlour and lie at the window
i left the house in bad humour and walked slowly towards the school the air was pitilessly raw and already my heart misgave me
i sat staring at the clock for some time and when its ticking began to irritate me i left the room
when i came home to dinner my uncle had not yet been home still it was early i mounted the staircase and gained the upper part of the house
the high cold empty gloomy room liberated me and i went from room to room singing from the front window i saw my companions playing below in the street
their cries reached me weakened and indistinct and leaning my forehead against the cool glass i looked over at the dark house where she lived
i may have stood there for an hour seeing nothing but the brown clad figure cast by my imagination touched discreetly by the lamplight at the curved neck at the hand upon the railings and at the border below the dress
when i came downstairs again i found mrs mercer sitting at the fire she was an old garrulous woman a pawnbroker widow who collected used stamps for some pious purpose
i had to endure the gossip of the tea table the meal was prolonged beyond an hour and still my uncle did not come
mrs mercer stood up to go she was sorry she couldnt wait any longer but it was after eight clock and she did not like to be out late as the night air was bad for her
when she had gone i began to walk up and down the room clenching my fists my aunt said i afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of our lord
at nine clock i heard my uncle latchkey in the halldoor i heard him talking to himself and heard the hallstand rocking when it had received the weight of his overcoat
i could interpret these signs when he was midway through his dinner i asked him to give me the money to go to the bazaar
he had forgotten the people are in bed and after their first sleep now he said i did not smile
my aunt said to him energetically cant you give him the money and let him go you ve kept him late enough as it is
my uncle said he was very sorry he had forgotten he said he believed in the old saying all work and no play makes jack_mooney a dull boy
he asked me where i was going and when i had told him a second time he asked me did i know the arab farewell to his steed
when i left the kitchen he was about to recite the opening lines of the piece to my aunt i held a florin tightly in my hand as i strode down buckingham street towards the station
the sight of the street thronged with buyers and glaring with gas recalled to me the purpose of my journey i took my seat in a third class carriage of a deserted train
after an intolerable delay the train moved out of the station slowly it crept onward among ruinous house and over the twinkling river
at westland row station a crowd of people pressed to the carriage door but the porters moved them back saying that it was a special train for the bazaar
i passed out on to the road and saw by the lighted dial of a clock that it was ten minute to ten
i remained alone in the bare carriage in a few minute the train drew up beside an improvised wooden platform in front of me was a large building which displayed the magical name
i could not find any sixpenny entrance and fearing that the bazaar would be closed i passed in quickly through a turnstile handing a shilling to a weary looking man
i found myself in a big hall girdled at half its height by a gallery nearly all the stalls were closed and the greater part of the hall was in darkness
i recognised a silence like that which pervades a church after a service i walked into the centre of the bazaar timidly
before a curtain over which the word cafe chantant were written in coloured lamp two man were counting money on a salver
a few people were gathered about the stalls which were still open i listened to the fall of the coins remembering with difficulty why i had come
i went over to one of the stalls and examined porcelain vases and flowered tea sets at the door of the stall a young lady was talking and laughing with two young gentleman
i remarked their english accents and listened vaguely to their conversation i never said such a thing but you did
but i didnt didnt she say that yes i heard her there a fib observing me the young lady came over and asked me did i wish to buy anything
the tone of her voice was not encouraging she seemed to have spoken to me out of a sense of duty
i looked humbly at the great jars that stood like eastern guards at either side of the dark entrance to the stall and murmured no thank you
the young lady changed the position of one of the vases and went back to the two young man they began to talk of the same subject
i lingered before her stall though i knew my stay was useless to make my interest in her wares seem the more real
once or twice the young lady glanced at me over her shoulder then i turned away slowly and walked down the middle of the bazaar
i allowed the two pennies to fall against the sixpence in my pocket i heard a voice call from one end of the gallery that the light was out
gazing up into the darkness i saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity and my eye burned with anguish and anger
the upper part of the hall was now completely dark eveline she sat at the window watching the evening invade the avenue
her head was leaned against the window curtains and in her nostrils was the odour of dusty cretonne she was tired
the man out of the last house passed on his way home she heard his footsteps clacking along the concrete pavement and afterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red house
one time there used to be a field there in which they used to play every evening with other people child
then a man from belfast bought the field and built house in it not like their little brown house but bright brick house with shining roofs
the child of the avenue used to play together in that field the devines the waters the dunns little keogh the cripple she and her brothers and sister
her father used often to hunt them in out of the field with his blackthorn stick but usually little keogh used to keep nix and call out when he saw her father coming
few people passed ernest however never played he was too grown up still they seemed to have been rather happy then
her father was not so bad then and besides her mother was alive that was a long time ago she and her brothers and sister were all grown up her mother was dead
tizzie dunn was dead too and the waters had gone back to england everything changes now she was going to go away like the other to leave her home
she looked round the room reviewing all its familiar objects which she had dusted once a week for so many year wondering where on earth all the dust came from
and yet during all those year she had never found out the name of the priest whose yellowing photograph hung on the wall above the broken harmonium beside the coloured print of the promises made to blessed margaret mary_jane alacoque
home perhaps she would never see again those familiar objects from which she had never dreamed of being divided he had been a school friend of her father
whenever he showed the photograph to a visitor her father used to pass it with a casual word he is in melbourne now
she had consented to go away to leave her home was that wise she tried to weigh each side of the question
in her home anyway she had shelter and food she had those whom she had known all her life about her
what would they say of her in the stores when they found out that she had run away with a fellow
of course she had to work hard both in the house and at business say she was a fool perhaps and her place would be filled up by advertisement
miss gavan would be glad she had always had an edge on her especially whenever there were people listening miss hill dont you see these lady are waiting
look lively miss hill please she would not cry many tears at leaving the stores but in her new home in a distant unknown country it would not be like that
then she would be married she eveline people would treat her with respect then she would not be treated as her mother had been
even now though she was over nineteen she sometimes felt herself in danger of her father violence she knew it was that that had given her the palpitations
when they were growing up he had never gone for her like he used to go for harry and ernest because she was a girl but latterly he had begun to threaten her and say what he would do to her only for her dead mother sake
and now she had nobody to protect her ernest was dead and harry who was in the church decorating business was nearly always down somewhere in the country
she always gave her entire wages seven shillings and harry always sent up what he could but the trouble was to get any money from her father
he said she used to squander the money that she had no head that he wasnt going to give her his hard earned money to throw about the street and much more for he was usually fairly bad of a saturday night
besides the invariable squabble for money on saturday night had begun to weary her unspeakably in the end he would give her the money and ask her had she any intention of buying sunday dinner
then she had to rush out as quickly as she could and do her marketing holding her black leather purse tightly in her hand as she elbowed her way through the crowd and returning home late under her load of provisions
she had hard work to keep the house together and to see that the two young child who had been left to her charge went to school regularly and got their meals regularly
it was hard work a hard life but now that she was about to leave it she did not find it a wholly undesirable life
she was to go away with him by the night boat to be his wife and to live with him in buenos ayres where he had a home waiting for her
how well she remembered the first time she had seen him he was lodging in a house on the main road where she used to visit
she was about to explore another life with frank frank was very kind manly open hearted it seemed a few week ago
he was standing at the gate his peaked cap pushed back on his head and his hair tumbled forward over a face of bronze
then they had come to know each other he used to meet her outside the stores every evening and see her home
he took her to see the bohemian girl and she felt elated as she sat in an unaccustomed part of the theatre with him
people knew that they were courting and when he sang about the lass that loves a sailor she always felt pleasantly confused
he was awfully fond of music and sang a little he used to call her poppens out of fun first of all it had been an excitement for her to have a fellow
he had started as a deck boy at a pound a month on a ship of the allan line going out to canada
and then she had begun to like him he had tales of distant country he told her the name of the ships he had been on and the name of the different services
he had fallen on his foot in buenos ayres he said and had come over to the old country just for a holiday
he had sailed through the straits of magellan and he told her story of the terrible patagonians of course her father had found out the affair and had forbidden her to have anything to say to him
i know these sailor chap he said one day he had quarrelled with frank and after that she had to meet her lover secretly
the evening deepened in the avenue the white of two letters in her lap grew indistinct one was to harry the other was to her father
ernest had been her favourite but she liked harry too her father was becoming old lately she noticed he would miss her
not long before when she had been laid up for a day he had read her out a ghost story and made toast for her at the fire
sometimes he could be very nice another day when their mother was alive they had all gone for a picnic to the hill of howth
her time was running out but she continued to sit by the window leaning her head against the window curtain inhaling the odour of dusty cretonne
she remembered her father putting on her mother bonnet to make the child laugh down far in the avenue she could hear a street organ playing
strange that it should come that very night to remind her of the promise to her mother her promise to keep the home together as long as she could
she remembered the last night of her mother illness she was again in the close dark room at the other side of the hall and outside she heard a melancholy air of italy
she knew the air the organ player had been ordered to go away and given sixpence she remembered her father strutting back into the sickroom saying
as she mused the pitiful vision of her mother life laid its spell on the very quick of her being that life of commonplace sacrifices closing in final craziness
damned italians coming over here she trembled as she heard again her mother voice saying constantly with foolish insistence derevaun seraun
derevaun seraun she stood up in a sudden impulse of terror escape she must escape frank would save her he would give her life perhaps love too
but she wanted to live why should she be unhappy she had a right to happiness frank would take her in his arm fold her in his arm
he held her hand and she knew that he was speaking to her saying something about the passage over and over again
he would save her she stood among the swaying crowd in the station at the north wall the station was full of soldiers with brown baggages
through the wide door of the sheds she caught a glimpse of the black mass of the boat lying in beside the quay wall with illumined portholes
she felt her cheek pale and cold and out of a maze of distress she prayed to god to direct her to show her what was her duty
she answered nothing the boat blew a long mournful whistle into the mist if she went tomorrow she would be on the sea with frank steaming towards buenos ayres
their passage had been booked could she still draw back after all he had done for her her distress awoke a nausea in her body and she kept moving her lip in silent fervent prayer
a bell clanged upon her heart she felt him seize her hand come all the seas of the world tumbled about her heart
he was drawing her into them he would drown her she gripped with both hand at the iron railing come no
no no it was impossible her hand clutched the iron in frenzy amid the seas she sent a cry of anguish
eveline evvy he rushed beyond the barrier and called to her to follow he was shouted at to go on but he still called to her
she set her white face to him passive like a helpless animal her eye gave him no sign of love or farewell or recognition
after the race the car came scudding in towards dublin running evenly like pellets in the groove of the naas road
at the crest of the hill at inchicore sightseers had gathered in clumps to watch the car careering homeward and through this channel of poverty and inaction the continent sped its wealth and industry
now and again the clumps of people raised the cheer of the gratefully oppressed their sympathy however was for the blue car the car of their friend the french
their team had finished solidly they had been placed second and third and the driver of the winning german car was reported a belgian
each blue car therefore received a double measure of welcome as it topped the crest of the hill and each cheer of welcome was acknowledged with smiles and nods by those in the car
in one of these trimly built car was a party of four young man whose spirits seemed to be at present well above the level of successful gallicism in fact these four young man were almost hilarious
they were charles segouin the owner of the car andre riviere a young electrician of canadian birth a huge hungarian named villona and a neatly groomed young man named doyle
segouin was in good humour because he had unexpectedly received some order in advance he was about to start a motor establishment in paris
and riviere was in good humour because he was to be appointed manager of the establishment these two young man who were cousins were also in good humour because of the success of the french car
villona was in good humour because he had had a very satisfactory luncheon and besides he was an optimist by nature
the french moreover were virtual victors the fourth member of the party however was too excited to be genuinely happy he was about twenty six year of age with a soft light brown moustache and rather innocent looking grey eye
he had made his money as a butcher in kingstown and by opening shop in dublin and in the suburbs he had made his money many time over
he had also been fortunate enough to secure some of the police contracts and in the end he had become rich enough to be alluded to in the dublin newspapers as a merchant prince
he had sent his son to england to be educated in a big catholic college and had afterwards sent him to dublin university to study law
his father who had begun life as an advanced nationalist had modified his views early jimmy did not study very earnestly and took to bad course for a while
he had money and he was popular and he divided his time curiously between musical and motoring circles then he had been sent for a term to cambridge to see a little life
his father remonstrative but covertly proud of the excess had paid his bills and brought him home it was at cambridge that he had met segouin
they were not much more than acquaintances as yet but jimmy found great pleasure in the society of one who had seen so much of the world and was reputed to own some of the biggest hotels in france
such a person as his father agreed was well worth knowing even if he had not been the charming companion he was
villona was entertaining also a brilliant pianist but unfortunately very poor the car ran on merrily with its cargo of hilarious youth the two cousins sat on the front seat jimmy and his hungarian friend sat behind
the frenchmen flung their laughter and light word over their shoulder and often jimmy had to strain forward to catch the quick phrase
this was not altogether pleasant for him as he had nearly always to make a deft guess at the meaning and shout back a suitable answer in the face of a high wind
decidedly villona was in excellent spirits he kept up a deep bass hum of melody for miles of the road besides villona humming would confuse anybody the noise of the car too
rapid motion through space elates one so does notoriety so does the possession of money these were three good reasons for jimmy excitement
at the control segouin had presented him to one of the french competitors and in answer to his confused murmur of compliment the swarthy face of the driver had disclosed a line of shining white teeth
he had been seen by many of his friend that day in the company of these continentals it was pleasant after that honour to return to the profane world of spectators amid nudges and significant looks
then as to money he really had a great sum under his control segouin perhaps would not think it a great sum
but jimmy who in spite of temporary errors was at heart the inheritor of solid instincts knew well with what difficulty it had been got together
this knowledge had previously kept his bills within the limits of reasonable recklessness and if he had been so conscious of the labour latent in money when there had been question merely of some freak of the higher intelligence how much more so now when he was about to stake the greater part of his substance
of course the investment was a good one and segouin had managed to give the impression that it was by a favour of friendship the mite of irish money was to be included in the capital of the concern
jimmy had a respect for his father shrewdness in business matter and in this case it had been his father who had first suggested the investment money to be made in the motor business pots of money
it was a serious thing for him moreover segouin had the unmistakable air of wealth jimmy set out to translate into day work that lordly car in which he sat
the journey laid a magical finger on the genuine pulse of life and gallantly the machinery of human nerves strove to answer the bounding course of the swift blue animal
how smoothly it ran in what style they had come careering along the country road they drove down dame street the street was busy with unusual traffic loud with the horns of motorists and the gongs of impatient tram drivers
near the bank segouin drew up and jimmy and his friend alighted a little knot of people collected on the footpath to pay homage to the snorting motor
the party was to dine together that evening in segouin hotel and meanwhile jimmy and his friend who was staying with him were to go home to dress
the car steered out slowly for grafton street while the two young man pushed their way through the knot of gazers
they walked northward with a curious feeling of disappointment in the exercise while the city hung its pale globes of light above them in a haze of summer evening
a certain pride mingled with his parents trepidation a certain eagerness also to play fast and loose for the name of great foreign city have at least this virtue
jimmy too looked very well when he was dressed and as he stood in the hall giving a last equation to the bows of his dress tie his father may have felt even commercially satisfied at having secured for his son qualities often unpurchaseable
his father therefore was unusually friendly with villona and his manner expressed a real respect for foreign accomplishments but this subtlety of his host was probably lost upon the hungarian who was beginning to have a sharp desire for his dinner
in jimmy house this dinner had been pronounced an occasion the dinner was excellent exquisite segouin jimmy decided had a very refined taste
the party was increased by a young englishman named routh whom jimmy had seen with segouin at cambridge the young man supped in a snug room lit by electric candle lamp
jimmy whose imagination was kindling conceived the lively youth of the frenchmen twined elegantly upon the firm framework of the englishman manner
they talked volubly and with little reserve a graceful image of his he thought and a just one he admired the dexterity with which their host directed the conversation
villona with immense respect began to discover to the mildly surprised englishman the beauties of the english madrigal deploring the loss of old instruments
the five young man had various tastes and their tongue had been loosened riviere not wholly ingenuously undertook to explain to jimmy the triumph of the french mechanicians
the resonant voice of the hungarian was about to prevail in ridicule of the spurious lutes of the romantic painters when segouin shepherded his party into politics
jimmy under generous influences felt the buried zeal of his father wake to life within him he aroused the torpid routh at last
here was congenial ground for all the room grew doubly hot and segouin task grew harder each moment there was even danger of personal spite
the alert host at an opportunity lifted his glass to humanity and when the toast had been drunk he threw open a window significantly
that night the city wore the mask of a capital the five young man strolled along stephen green in a faint cloud of aromatic smoke
at the corner of grafton street a short fat man was putting two handsome lady on a car in charge of another fat man
they talked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from their shoulder the people made way for them the car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the party
andre it farley a torrent of talk followed farley was an american no one knew very well what the talk was about
villona and riviere were the noisiest but all the man were excited they got up on a car squeezing themselves together amid much laughter
they took the train at westland row and in a few seconds as it seemed to jimmy they were walking out of kingstown station
they drove by the crowd blended now into soft colours to a music of merry bells the ticket collector saluted jimmy he was an old man fine night sir
it was a serene summer night the harbour lay like a darkened mirror at their foot they proceeded towards it with linked arm singing cadet roussel in chorus stamping their foot at every
ho ho hohe vraiment they got into a rowboat at the slip and made out for the american yacht there was to be supper music cards
villona said with conviction it is delightful there was a yacht piano in the cabin villona played a waltz for farley and riviere farley acting as cavalier and riviere as lady
then an impromptu square dance the man devising original figure what merriment jimmy took his part with a will this was seeing life at least
then farley got out of breath and cried stop a man brought in a light supper and the young man sat down to it for form sake
they drank however it was bohemian they drank ireland england france hungary the united states of america jimmy made a speech a long speech villona saying hear hear
whenever there was a pause there was a great clapping of hand when he sat down it must have been a good speech
farley clapped him on the back and laughed loudly what jovial fellow what good company they were cards cards the table was cleared
villona returned quietly to his piano and played voluntaries for them the other man played game after game flinging themselves boldly into the adventure
they drank the health of the queen of heart and of the queen of diamonds jimmy felt obscurely the lack of an audience the wit was flashing
play ran very high and paper began to pass jimmy did not know exactly who was winning but he knew that he was losing
but it was his own fault for he frequently mistook his cards and the other man had to calculate his i u for him
they were devils of fellow but he wished they would stop it was getting late someone gave the toast of the yacht
the belle of newport and then someone proposed one great game for a finish the piano had stopped villona must have gone up on deck
it was a terrible game they stopped just before the end of it to drink for luck jimmy understood that the game lay between routh and segouin
what excitement jimmy was excited too he would lose of course how much had he written away the man rose to their foot to play the last tricks
talking and gesticulating routh won the cabin shook with the young man cheering and the cards were bundled together they began then to gather in what they had won
he knew that he would regret in the morning but at present he was glad of the rest glad of the dark stupor that would cover up his folly
farley and jimmy were the heaviest losers he leaned his elbows on the table and rested his head between his hand counting the beats of his temples
two gallants the grey warm evening of august had descended upon the city and a mild warm air a memory of summer circulated in the street
the cabin door opened and he saw the hungarian standing in a shaft of grey light daybreak gentleman the street shuttered for the repose of sunday swarmed with a gaily coloured crowd
like illumined pearls the lamp shone from the summits of their tall poles upon the living texture below which changing shape and hue unceasingly sent up into the warm grey evening air an unchanging unceasing murmur
two young man came down the hill of rutland square one of them was just bringing a long monologue to a close
the other who walked on the verge of the path and was at time obliged to step on to the road owing to his companion rudeness wore an amused listening face
a yachting cap was shoved far back from his forehead and the narrative to which he listened made constant waves of expression break forth over his face from the corner of his nose and eye and mouth
he was squat and ruddy little jets of wheezing laughter followed one another out of his convulsed body his eye twinkling with cunning enjoyment glanced at every moment towards his companion face
once or twice he rearranged the light waterproof which he had slung over one shoulder in toreador fashion his breeches his white rubber shoes and his jauntily slung waterproof expressed youth
but his figure fell into rotundity at the waist his hair was scant and grey and his face when the waves of expression had passed over it had a ravaged look
when he was quite sure that the narrative had ended he laughed noiselessly for fully half a minute then he said well
that takes the biscuit his voice seemed winnowed of vigour and to enforce his word he added with humour that takes the solitary unique and if i may so call it recherche biscuit
he became serious and silent when he had said this his tongue was tired for he had been talking all the afternoon in a public house in dorset street
but in spite of this reputation his adroitness and eloquence had always prevented his friend from forming any general policy against him
he had a brave manner of coming up to a party of them in a bar and of holding himself nimbly at the borders of the company until he was included in a round
most people considered lenehan a leech he was a sporting vagrant armed with a vast stock of story limericks and riddles
he was insensitive to all kinds of discourtesy no one knew how he achieved the stern task of living but his name was vaguely associated with racing tissues
and where did you pick her up corley he asked corley ran his tongue swiftly along his upper lip
one night man he said i was going along dame street and i spotted a fine tart under waterhouse clock and said good night you know
so we went for a walk round by the canal and she told me she was a slavey in a house in baggot street
i put my arm round her and squeezed her a bit that night then next sunday man i met her by appointment
we went out to donnybrook and i brought her into a field there she told me she used to go with a dairyman
it was fine man cigarettes every night she bring me and paying the tram out and back and one night she brought me two bloody fine cigars
o the real cheese you know that the old fellow used to smoke i was afraid man she get in the family way
but she up to the dodge maybe she thinks you ll marry her said lenehan i told her i was out of a job said corley
i told her i was in pim she doesnt know my name i was too hairy to tell her that
but she thinks i a bit of class you know lenehan laughed again noiselessly of all the good one ever i heard he said that emphatically takes the biscuit
the swing of his burly body made his friend execute a few light skips from the path to the roadway and back again
corley stride acknowledged the compliment corley was the son of an inspector of police and he had inherited his father frame and gait
his head was large globular and oily it sweated in all weathers and his large round hat set upon it sideways looked like a bulb which had grown out of another
he always stared straight before him as if he were on parade and when he wished to gaze after someone in the street it was necessary for him to move his body from the hips
he walked with his hand by his side holding himself erect and swaying his head from side to side at present he was about town
whenever any job was vacant a friend was always ready to give him the hard word he was often to be seen walking with policemen in plain clothes talking earnestly
he knew the inner side of all affairs and was fond of delivering final judgments he spoke without listening to the speech of his companions
his conversation was mainly about himself what he had said to such a person and what such a person had said to him and what he had said to settle the matter
when he reported these dialogues he aspirated the first letter of his name after the manner of florentines lenehan offered his friend a cigarette
as the two young man walked on through the crowd corley occasionally turned to smile at some of the passing girl
but lenehan gaze was fixed on the large faint moon circled with a double halo he watched earnestly the passing of the grey web of twilight across its face
at length he said well tell me corley i suppose you ll be able to pull it off all right eh corley closed one eye expressively as an answer
is she game for that asked lenehan dubiously you can never know woman she all right said corley
i know the way to get around her man she a bit gone on me you re what i call a gay lothario said lenehan
and the proper kind of a lothario too a shade of mockery relieved the servility of his manner to save himself he had the habit of leaving his flattery open to the interpretation of raillery
but corley had not a subtle mind there nothing to touch a good slavey he affirmed take my tip for it
by one who has tried them all said lenehan first i used to go with girl you know said corley unbosoming girl off the south circular
i used to take them out man on the tram somewhere and pay the tram or take them to a band or a play at the theatre or buy them chocolate and sweets or something that way
i used to spend money on them right enough he added in a convincing tone as if he was conscious of being disbelieved
but lenehan could well believe it he nodded gravely i know that game he said and it a mug game
and damn the thing i ever got out of it said corley ditto here said lenehan only off of one of them said corley
he moistened his upper lip by running his tongue along it the recollection brightened his eye he too gazed at the pale disc of the moon now nearly veiled and seemed to meditate
she was a bit of all right he said regretfully he was silent again then he added she on the turf now
i saw her driving down earl street one night with two fellow with her on a car i suppose that your doing said lenehan
there was other at her before me said corley philosophically this time lenehan was inclined to disbelieve he shook his head to and fro and smiled
you know you cant kid me corley he said honest to god said corley didnt she tell me herself
as they passed along the railings of trinity college lenehan skipped out into the road and peered up at the clock
lenehan made a tragic gesture base betrayer he said twenty after he said time enough said corley
she ll be there all right i always let her wait a bit lenehan laughed quietly ecod corley you know how to take them he said
i up to all their little tricks corley confessed but tell me said lenehan again are you sure you can bring it off
all right you know it a ticklish job they re damn close on that point eh what his bright small eye searched his companion face for reassurance
corley swung his head to and fro as if to toss aside an insistent insect and his brows gathered i ll pull it off he said
he did not wish to ruffle his friend temper to be sent to the devil and told that his advice was not wanted
leave it to me cant you lenehan said no more a little tact was necessary but corley brow was soon smooth again
his thought were running another way she a fine decent tart he said with appreciation that what she is
not far from the porch of the club a harpist stood in the roadway playing to a little ring of listeners
he plucked at the wires heedlessly glancing quickly from time to time at the face of each new comer and from time to time wearily also at the sky
his harp too heedless that her coverings had fallen about her knees seemed weary alike of the eye of strangers and of her master hand
one hand played in the bass the melody of silent moyle while the other hand careered in the treble after each group of note
they walked along nassau street and then turned into kildare street the note of the air sounded deep and full the two young man walked up the street without speaking the mournful music following them
when they reached stephen green they crossed the road here the noise of tram the light and the crowd released them from their silence
there she is said corley at the corner of hume street a young woman was standing she wore a blue dress and a white sailor hat
she stood on the curbstone swinging a sunshade in one hand lenehan grew lively let have a look at her corley he said
corley glanced sideways at his friend and an unpleasant grin appeared on his face are you trying to get inside me
he asked damn it said lenehan boldly i dont want an introduction all i want is to have a look at her
i not going to eat her a look at her said corley more amiably well i ll tell you what
i ll go over and talk to her and you can pass by right said lenehan corley had already thrown one leg over the chains when lenehan called out
and after where will we meet half ten answered corley bringing over his other leg where corner of merrion street
we ll be coming back work it all right now said lenehan in farewell corley did not answer he sauntered across the road swaying his head from side to side
his bulk his easy pace and the solid sound of his boots had something of the conqueror in them he approached the young woman and without saluting began at once to converse with her
she swung her umbrella more quickly and executed half turns on her heels once or twice when he spoke to her at close quarters she laughed and bent her head
lenehan observed them for a few minute then he walked rapidly along beside the chains at some distance and crossed the road obliquely
as he approached hume street corner he found the air heavily scented and his eye made a swift anxious scrutiny of the young woman appearance
she had her sunday finery on her blue serge skirt was held at the waist by a belt of black leather
the great silver buckle of her belt seemed to depress the centre of her body catching the light stuff of her white blouse like a clip
the end of her tulle collarette had been carefully disordered and a big bunch of red flowers was pinned in her bosomm stems upwards
she wore a short black jacket with mother of pearl buttons and a ragged black boa lenehan eye noted approvingly her stout short muscular body
frank rude health glowed in her face on her fat red cheeks and in her unabashed blue eye her features were blunt
she had broad nostrils a straggling mouth which lay open in a contented leer and two projecting front teeth as he passed lenehan took off his cap and after about ten seconds corley returned a salute to the air
this he did by raising his hand vaguely and pensively changing the angle of position of his hat lenehan walked as far as the shelbourne hotel where he halted and waited
after waiting for a little time he saw them coming towards him and when they turned to the right he followed them stepping lightly in his white shoes down one side of merrion square
as he walked on slowly timing his pace to theirs he watched corley head which turned at every moment towards the young woman face like a big ball revolving on a pivot
he kept the pair in view until he had seen them climbing the stair of the donnybrook tram then he turned about and went back the way he had come
his gaiety seemed to forsake him and as he came by the railings of the duke lawn he allowed his hand to run along them
now that he was alone his face looked older the air which the harpist had played began to control his movements
his softly padded foot played the melody while his finger swept a scale of variations idly along the railings after each group of note
he walked listlessly round stephen green and then down grafton street though his eye took note of many elements of the crowd through which he passed they did so morosely
he found trivial all that was meant to charm him and did not answer the glances which invited him to be bold
he knew that he would have to speak a great deal to invent and to amuse and his brain and throat were too dry for such a task
the problem of how he could pass the hour till he met corley again troubled him a little he could think of no way of passing them but to keep on walking
he turned to the left when he came to the corner of rutland square and felt more at ease in the dark quiet street the sombre look of which suited his mood
he paused at last before the window of a poor looking shop over which the word refreshment bar were printed in white letters
a cut ham was exposed on a great blue dish while near it on a plate lay a segment of very light plum pudding
he eyed this food earnestly for some time and then after glancing warily up and down the street went into the shop quickly
he was hungry for except some biscuits which he had asked two grudging curates to bring him he had eaten nothing since breakfast time
on the glass of the window were two flying inscriptions ginger beer and ginger ale he sat down at an uncovered wooden table opposite two work girl and a mechanic
a slatternly girl waited on him how much is a plate of peas he asked three halfpence sir said the girl
he spoke roughly in order to belie his air of gentility for his entry had been followed by a pause of talk
bring me a plate of peas he said and a bottle of ginger beer his face was heated to appear natural he pushed his cap back on his head and planted his elbows on the table
the girl brought him a plate of grocer hot peas seasoned with pepper and vinegar a fork and his ginger beer
the mechanic and the two work girl examined him point by point before resuming their conversation in a subdued voice he ate his food greedily and found it so good that he made a note of the shop mentally
when he had eaten all the peas he sipped his ginger beer and sat for some time thinking of corley adventure
in his imagination he beheld the pair of lovers walking along some dark road he heard corley voice in deep energetic gallantries and saw again the leer of the young woman mouth
this vision made him feel keenly his own poverty of purse and spirit he was tired of knocking about of pulling the devil by the tail of shifts and intrigues
he would be thirty one in november would he never get a good job would he never have a home of his own
he thought how pleasant it would be to have a warm fire to sit by and a good dinner to sit down to
he had walked the street long enough with friend and with girl he knew what those friend were worth he knew the girl too
experience had embittered his heart against the world but all hope had not left him he felt better after having eaten than he had felt before less weary of his life less vanquished in spirit
he might yet be able to settle down in some snug corner and live happily if he could only come across some good simple minded girl with a little of the ready
he paid twopence halfpenny to the slatternly girl and went out of the shop to begin his wandering again he went into capel street and walked along towards the city hall
then he turned into dame street at the corner of george street he met two friend of his and stopped to converse with them
he was glad that he could rest from all his walking his friend asked him had he seen corley and what was the latest
he replied that he had spent the day with corley his friend talked very little they looked vacantly after some figure in the crowd and sometimes made a critical remark
one said that he had seen mac an hour before in westmoreland street at this lenehan said that he had been with mac the night before in egan
the young man who had seen mac in westmoreland street asked was it true that mac had won a bit over a billiard match
lenehan did not know he said that mr_holohan had stood them drink in egan he left his friend at a quarter to ten and went up george street
the crowd of girl and young man had thinned and on his way up the street he heard many groups and couples bidding one another good night
he turned to the left at the city markets and walked on into grafton street he went as far as the clock of the college of surgeons it was on the stroke of ten
when he reached the corner of merrion street he took his stand in the shadow of a lamp and brought out one of the cigarettes which he had reserved and lit it
he leaned against the lamp post and kept his gaze fixed on the part from which he expected to see corley and the young woman return
he set off briskly along the northern side of the green hurrying for fear corley should return too soon his mind became active again
he wondered had corley managed it successfully he wondered if he had asked her yet or if he would leave it to the last
but the memory of corley slowly revolving head calmed him somewhat he was sure corley would pull it off all right
all at once the idea struck him that perhaps corley had seen her home by another way and given him the slip
he suffered all the pangs and thrills of his friend situation as well as those of his own his eye searched the street there was no sign of them
yet it was surely half an hour since he had seen the clock of the college of surgeons would corley do a thing like that
he lit his last cigarette and began to smoke it nervously he strained his eye as each tram stopped at the far corner of the square
they must have gone home by another way the paper of his cigarette broke and he flung it into the road with a curse
suddenly he saw them coming towards him he started with delight and keeping close to his lamp post tried to read the result in their walk
they were walking quickly the young woman taking quick short step while corley kept beside her with his long stride they did not seem to be speaking
an intimation of the result pricked him like the point of a sharp instrument he knew corley would fail he knew it was no go
they turned down baggot street and he followed them at once taking the other footpath when they stopped he stopped too
they talked for a few moment and then the young woman went down the step into the area of a house
corley remained standing at the edge of the path a little distance from the front step some minute passed then the hall door was opened slowly and cautiously
a woman came running down the front step and coughed corley turned and went towards her his broad figure hid hers from view for a few seconds and then she reappeared running up the step
the door closed on her and corley began to walk swiftly towards stephen green lenehan hurried on in the same direction
he took them as a warning and glancing back towards the house which the young woman had entered to see that he was not observed he ran eagerly across the road
some drops of light rain fell anxiety and his swift run made him pant he called out hallo corley corley turned his head to see who had called him and then continued walking as before
lenehan ran after him settling the waterproof on his shoulder with one hand hallo corley he cried again he came level with his friend and looked keenly in his face
he could see nothing there well he said did it come off they had reached the corner of ely place
still without answering corley swerved to the left and went up the side street his features were composed in stern calm
lenehan kept up with his friend breathing uneasily he was baffled and a note of menace pierced through his voice
cant you tell us he said did you try her corley halted at the first lamp and stared grimly before him
then with a grave gesture he extended a hand towards the light and smiling opened it slowly to the gaze of his disciple
a small gold coin shone in the palm the boarding house mrs_mooney was a butcher daughter she was a woman who was quite able to keep thing to herself a determined woman
she had married her father foreman and opened a butcher shop near spring gardens but as soon as his father in law was dead mr mrs_mooney began to go to the devil
he drank plundered the till ran headlong into debt it was no use making him take the pledge he was sure to break out again a few day after
by fighting his wife in the presence of customers and by buying bad meat he ruined his business one night he went for his wife with the cleaver and she had to sleep in a neighbour house
after that they lived apart she went to the priest and got a separation from him with care of the child
she would give him neither money nor food nor house room and so he was obliged to enlist himself as a sheriff man
he was a shabby stooped little drunkard with a white face and a white moustache and white eyebrows pencilled above his little eye which were pink veined and raw and all day long he sat in the bailiff room waiting to be put on a job
mrs_mooney who had taken what remained of her money out of the butcher business and set up a boarding house in hardwicke street was a big imposing woman
her house had a floating population made up of tourists from liverpool and the isle of man and occasionally artiste from the music hall
she governed her house cunningly and firmly knew when to give credit when to be stern and when to let thing pass
its resident population was made up of clerk from the city all the resident young man spoke of her as the madam
mrs_mooney young man paid fifteen shillings a week for board and lodgings beer or stout at dinner excluded they shared in common tastes and occupations and for this reason they were very chummy with one another
jack_mooney the madam son who was clerk to a commission agent in fleet street had the reputation of being a hard case
they discussed with one another the chances of favourites and outsiders he was fond of using soldiers obscenities usually he came home in the small hour
when he met his friend he had always a good one to tell them and he was always sure to be on to a good thing that is to say a likely horse or a likely artiste
he was also handy with the mits and sang comic songs on sunday night there would often be a reunion in mrs_mooney front drawing room
the music hall artiste would oblige and sheridan played waltzes and polkas and vamped accompaniments polly mrs_mooney the madam daughter would also sing
she sang i a naughty girl you neednt sham you know i am polly was a slim girl of nineteen she had light soft hair and a small full mouth
her eye which were grey with a shade of green through them had a habit of glancing upwards when she spoke with anyone which made her look like a little perverse madonna
mrs_mooney had first sent her daughter to be a typist in a corn factor office but as a disreputable sheriff man used to come every other day to the office asking to be allowed to say a word to his daughter she had taken her daughter home again and set her to do housework
as polly was very lively the intention was to give her the run of the young man besides young man like to feel that there is a young woman not very far away
polly of course flirted with the young man but mrs_mooney who was a shrewd judge knew that the young man were only passing the time away none of them meant business
thing went on so for a long time and mrs_mooney began to think of sending polly back to typewriting when she noticed that something was going on between polly and one of the young man
she watched the pair and kept her own counsel polly knew that she was being watched but still her mother persistent silence could not be misunderstood
there had been no open complicity between mother and daughter no open understanding but though people in the house began to talk of the affair still mrs_mooney did not intervene
polly began to grow a little strange in her manner and the young man was evidently perturbed at last when she judged it to be the right moment mrs_mooney intervened
she dealt with moral problems as a cleaver deals with meat and in this case she had made up her mind
all the window of the boarding house were open and the lace curtains ballooned gently towards the street beneath the raised sashes
the belfry of george church sent out constant peals and worshippers singly or in groups traversed the little circus before the church revealing their purpose by their self contained demeanour no less than by the little volumes in their gloved hand
breakfast was over in the boarding house and the table of the breakfast room was covered with plate on which lay yellow streaks of eggs with morsels of bacon fat and bacon rind
it was a bright sunday morning of early summer promising heat but with a fresh breeze blowing mrs_mooney sat in the straw arm chair and watched the servant mary_jane remove the breakfast thing
when the table was cleared the broken bread collected the sugar and butter safe under lock and key she began to reconstruct the interview which she had had the night before with polly
thing were as she had suspected she had been frank in her question and polly had been frank in her answers
she made mary_jane collect the crusts and piece of broken bread to help to make tuesday bread pudding both had been somewhat awkward of course
she had been made awkward by her not wishing to receive the news in too cavalier a fashion or to seem to have connived and polly had been made awkward not merely because allusions of that kind always made her awkward but also because she did not wish it to be thought that in her wise innocence she had divined the intention behind her mother tolerance
mrs_mooney glanced instinctively at the little gilt clock on the mantelpiece as soon as she had become aware through her revery that the bells of george church had stopped ringing
it was seventeen minute past eleven she would have lots of time to have the matter out with mr doran and then catch short twelve at marlborough street
she was sure she would win to begin with she had all the weight of social opinion on her side she was an outraged mother
she had allowed him to live beneath her roof assuming that he was a man of honour and he had simply abused her hospitality
he was thirty four or thirty five year of age so that youth could not be pleaded as his excuse nor could ignorance be his excuse since he was a man who had seen something of the world
he had simply taken advantage of polly youth and inexperience that was evident the question was what reparation would he make
it is all very well for the man he can go his way as if nothing had happened having had his moment of pleasure but the girl has to bear the brunt
some mother would be content to patch up such an affair for a sum of money she had known case of it
there must be reparation made in such case but she would not do so for her only one reparation could make up for the loss of her daughter honour marriage
she counted all her cards again before sending mary_jane up to mr doran room to say that she wished to speak with him
she felt sure she would win he was a serious young man not rakish or loud voiced like the other if it had been mr sheridan or mr meade or bantam mr_lyons
her task would have been much harder she did not think he would face publicity all the lodgers in the house knew something of the affair details had been invented by some
besides he had been employed for thirteen year in a great catholic wine merchant office and publicity would mean for him perhaps the loss of his job
whereas if he agreed all might be well she knew he had a good screw for one thing and she suspected he had a bit of stuff put by
the decisive expression of her great florid face satisfied her and she thought of some mother she knew who could not get their daughter off their hand
nearly the half hour she stood up and surveyed herself in the pier glass mr doran was very anxious indeed this sunday morning
he had made two attempts to shave but his hand had been so unsteady that he had been obliged to desist
three day reddish beard fringed his jaws and every two or three minute a mist gathered on his glass so that he had to take them off and polish them with his pocket handkerchief
the recollection of his confession of the night before was a cause of acute pain to him the priest had drawn out every ridiculous detail of the affair and in the end had so magnified his sin that he was almost thankful at being afforded a loophole of reparation
the harm was done what could he do now but marry her or run away he could not brazen it out
the affair would be sure to be talked of and his employer would be certain to hear of it dublin is such a small city everyone knows everyone else business
he felt his heart leap warmly in his throat as he heard in his excited imagination old mr leonard calling out in his rasping voice
send mr doran here please all his long year of service gone for nothing all his industry and diligence thrown away
as a young man he had sown his wild oats of course he had boasted of his free thinking and denied the existence of god to his companions in public house
he still bought a copy of reynolds newspaper every week but he attended to his religious duties and for nine tenths of the year lived a regular life
but that was all passed and done with nearly he had money enough to settle down on it was not that
but the family would look down on her first of all there was her disreputable father and then her mother boarding house was beginning to get a certain fame
he had a notion that he was being had he could imagine his friend talking of the affair and laughing she was a little vulgar some time she said i seen and if i had ve known
but what would grammar matter if he really loved her he could not make up his mind whether to like her or despise her for what she had done
of course he had done it too his instinct urged him to remain free not to marry once you are married you are done for it said
while he was sitting helplessly on the side of the bed in shirt and trousers she tapped lightly at his door and entered
she told him all that she had made a clean breast of it to her mother and that her mother would speak with him that morning
she cried and threw her arm round his neck saying bob bob what am i to do what am i to do at all
she would put an end to herself she said he comforted her feebly telling her not to cry that it would be all right never fear
he remembered well with the curious patient memory of the celibate the first casual caresses her dress her breath her finger had given him
he felt against his shirt the agitation of her bosom it was not altogether his fault that it had happened then late one night as he was undressing for bed she had tapped at his door timidly
she wanted to relight her candle at his for hers had been blown out by a gust it was her bath night
she wore a loose open combing jacket of printed flannel her white instep shone in the opening of her furry slippers and the blood glowed warmly behind her perfumed skin
from her hand and wrists too as she lit and steadied her candle a faint perfume arose on night when he came in very late it was she who warmed up his dinner
he scarcely knew what he was eating feeling her beside him alone at night in the sleeping house and her thoughtfulness
if the night was anyway cold or wet or windy there was sure to be a little tumbler of punch ready for him
perhaps they could be happy together they used to go upstairs together on tiptoe each with a candle and on the third landing exchange reluctant good night
they used to kiss he remembered well her eye the touch of her hand and his delirium but delirium passes he echoed her phrase applying it to himself what am i to do
but the sin was there even his sense of honour told him that reparation must be made for such a sin
the instinct of the celibate warned him to hold back while he was sitting with her on the side of the bed
mary_jane came to the door and said that the missus wanted to see him in the parlour he stood up to put on his coat and waistcoat more helpless than ever
when he was dressed he went over to her to comfort her it would be all right never fear he left her crying on the bed and moaning softly
going down the stair his glass became so dimmed with moisture that he had to take them off and polish them
he longed to ascend through the roof and fly away to another country where he would never hear again of his trouble and yet a force pushed him downstairs step by step
on the last flight of stair he passed jack_mooney who was coming up from the pantry nursing two bottle of bass
they saluted coldly and the lover eye rested for a second or two on a thick bulldog face and a pair of thick short arm
when he reached the foot of the staircase he glanced up and saw jack_mooney regarding him from the door of the return room
suddenly he remembered the night when one of the music hall artiste a little blond londoner had made a rather free allusion to polly
my god the implacable face of his employer and of the madam stared upon his discomfiture the reunion had been almost broken up on account of jack_mooney violence
the music hall artiste a little paler than usual kept smiling and saying that there was no harm meant but jack_mooney kept shouting at him that if any fellow tried that sort of a game on with his sister he bloody well put his teeth down his throat so he would
everyone tried to quiet him polly sat for a little time on the side of the bed crying then she dried her eye and went over to the looking glass
she dipped the end of the towel in the water jug and refreshed her eye with the cool water she looked at herself in profile and readjusted a hairpin above her ear
then she went back to the bed again and sat at the foot she regarded the pillows for a long time and the sight of them awakened in her mind secret amiable memory
she rested the nape of her neck against the cool iron bed rail and fell into a reverie there was no longer any perturbation visible on her face
her hopes and visions were so intricate that she no longer saw the white pillows on which her gaze was fixed or remembered that she was waiting for anything
she waited on patiently almost cheerfully without alarm her memory gradually giving place to hopes and visions of the future at last she heard her mother calling
she started to her foot and ran to the banisters polly polly yes mamma come down dear mr doran wants to speak to you
then she remembered what she had been waiting for a little cloud eight year before he had seen his friend off at the north wall and wished him godspeed
ignatius_gallaher had got on you could tell that at once by his travelled air his well cut tweed suit and fearless accent
few fellow had talents like his and fewer still could remain unspoiled by such success ignatius_gallaher heart was in the right place and he had deserved to win
little_chandler thought ever since lunch time had been of his meeting with ignatius_gallaher of ignatius_gallaher invitation and of the great city london where ignatius_gallaher lived
he was called little_chandler because though he was but slightly under the average stature he gave one the idea of being a little man
it was something to have a friend like that his hand were white and small his frame was fragile his voice was quiet and his manner were refined
the half moons of his nails were perfect and when he smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish white teeth
he took the greatest care of his fair silken hair and moustache and used perfume discreetly on his handkerchief as he sat at his desk in the king inns he thought what changes those eight year had brought
the friend whom he had known under a shabby and necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the london press
he turned often from his tiresome writing to gaze out of the office window the glow of a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and walks
it cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the untidy nurses and decrepit old man who drowsed on the benches it flickered upon all the moving figure on the child who ran screaming along the gravel paths and on everyone who passed through the gardens
he watched the scene and thought of life and as always happened when he thought of life he became sad a gentle melancholy took possession of him
he felt how useless it was to struggle against fortune this being the burden of wisdom which the age had bequeathed to him
he had bought them in his bachelor day and many an evening as he sat in the little room off the hall he had been tempted to take one down from the bookshelf and read out something to his wife
he remembered the book of poetry upon his shelves at home but shyness had always held him back and so the book had remained on their shelves
at time he repeated lines to himself and this consoled him when his hour had struck he stood up and took leave of his desk and of his fellow clerk punctiliously
he emerged from under the feudal arch of the king inns a neat modest figure and walked swiftly down henrietta street
they stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the step before the gaping door or squatted like mice upon the thresholds
the golden sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp a horde of grimy child populated the street little_chandler gave them no thought
he picked his way deftly through all that minute vermin like life and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions in which the old nobility of dublin had roystered
no memory of the past touched him for his mind was full of a present joy he had never been in corless but he knew the value of the name
he knew that people went there after the theatre to eat oysters and drink liqueurs and he had heard that the waiters there spoke french and german
walking swiftly by at night he had seen cabs drawn up before the door and richly dressed lady escorted by cavaliers alight and enter quickly
they wore noisy dress and many wraps their face were powdered and they caught up their dress when they touched earth like alarmed atalantas
it was his habit to walk swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he found himself in the city late at night he hurried on his way apprehensively and excitedly
he chose the darkest and narrowest street and as he walked boldly forward the silence that was spread about his footsteps troubled him the wandering silent figure troubled him and at time a sound of low fugitive laughter made him tremble like a leaf
he had always passed without turning his head to look sometimes however he courted the causes of his fear he turned to the right towards capel street
ignatius_gallaher on the london press who would have thought it possible eight year before still now that he reviewed the past little_chandler could remember many signs of future greatness in his friend
of course he did mix with a rakish set of fellow at that time drank freely and borrowed money on all side
in the end he had got mixed up in some shady affair some money transaction at least that was one version of his flight
people used to say that ignatius_gallaher was wild but nobody denied him talent there was always a certain something in ignatius_gallaher that impressed you in spite of yourself
little_chandler remembered and the remembrance brought a slight flush of pride to his cheek one of ignatius_gallaher sayings when he was in a tight corner half time now boy he used to say light heartedly
even when he was out at elbows and at his wits end for money he kept up a bold face
where my considering cap that was ignatius_gallaher all out and damn it you couldnt but admire him for it
little_chandler quickened his pace for the first time in his life he felt himself superior to the people he passed
for the first time his soul revolted against the dull inelegance of capel street there was no doubt about it if you wanted to succeed you had to go away
you could do nothing in dublin as he crossed grattan bridge he looked down the river towards the lower quays and pitied the poor stunted house
they seemed to him a band of tramps huddled together along the riverbanks their old coats covered with dust and soot stupefied by the panorama of sunset and waiting for the first chill of night bid them arise shake themselves and begone
he wondered whether he could write a poem to express his idea perhaps ignatius_gallaher might be able to get it into some london paper for him
he was not sure what idea he wished to express but the thought that a poetic moment had touched him took life within him like an infant hope
could he write something original he stepped onward bravely every step brought him nearer to london farther from his own sober inartistic life
a light began to tremble on the horizon of his mind he was not so old thirty two his temperament might be said to be just at the point of maturity
there were so many different moods and impressions that he wished to express in verse he felt them within him he tried weigh to his soul to see if it was a poet soul
melancholy was the dominant note of his temperament he thought but it was a melancholy tempered by recurrences of faith and resignation and simple joy
if he could give expression to it in a book of poems perhaps man would listen he would never be popular he saw that
the english critics perhaps would recognise him as one of the celtic school by reason of the melancholy tone of his poems besides that he would put in allusions
he could not sway the crowd but he might appeal to a little circle of kindred mind he began to invent sentences and phrases from the notice which his book would get
mr little_chandler has the gift of easy and graceful verse wistful sadness pervades these poems the celtic note
it was a pity his name was not more irish looking perhaps it would be better to insert his mother name before the surname
thomas malone little_chandler or better stillt malone little_chandler he would speak to ignatius_gallaher about it he pursued his revery so ardently that he passed his street and had to turn back
as he came near corless his former agitation began to overmaster him and he halted before the door in indecision finally he opened the door and entered
the light and noise of the bar held him at the doorways for a few moment he looked about him but his sight was confused by the shining of many red and green wine glass
he glanced quickly to right and left frowning slightly to make his errand appear serious but when his sight cleared a little he saw that nobody had turned to look at him and there sure enough was ignatius_gallaher leaning with his back against the counter and his foot planted far apart
the bar seemed to him to be full of people and he felt that the people were observing him curiously
hallo tommy old hero here you are what is it to be what will you have i taking whisky better stuff than we get across the water
soda lithia no mineral i the same spoils the flavour here garcon bring us two halves of malt whisky like a good fellow
well and how have you been pulling along since i saw you last dear god how old we re getting do you see any signs of aging in me eh what
a little grey and thin on the top what ignatius_gallaher took off his hat and displayed a large closely cropped head
his eye which were of bluish slate colour relieved his unhealthy pallor and shone out plainly above the vivid orange tie he wore
his face was heavy pale and cleanshaven between these rival features the lip appeared very long and shapeless and colourless he bent his head and felt with two sympathetic finger the thin hair at the crown
little_chandler shook his head as a denial ignatius galaher put on his hat again it pulls you down he said
always hurry and scurry looking for copy and sometimes not finding it and then always to have something new in your stuff
press life damn proofs and printers i say for a few day i deuced glad i can tell you to get back to the old country

here you are tommy water say when little_chandler allowed his whisky to be very much diluted you dont know what good for you my boy said ignatius_gallaher
i drink mine neat i drink very little as a rule said little_chandler modestly an odd half one or so
when i meet any of the old crowd that all ah well said ignatius_gallaher cheerfully here to us and to old time and old acquaintance
they clinked glass and drank the toast i met some of the old gang today said ignatius_gallaher
o hara seems to be in a bad way what he doing nothing said little_chandler he gone to the dogs
but hogan has a good sit hasnt he yes he in the land commission i met him one night in london and he seemed to be very flush
poor hara boose i suppose other thing too said little_chandler shortly ignatius_gallaher laughed tommy he said i see you havent changed an atom
you re the very same serious person that used to lecture me on sunday morning when i had a sore head and a fur on my tongue
you want to knock about a bit in the world have you never been anywhere even for a trip i ve been to the isle of man said little_chandler
ignatius_gallaher laughed the isle of man he said go to london or paris paris for choice that do you good
have you seen paris i should think i have i ve knocked about there a little and is it really so beautiful as they say asked little_chandler
he sipped a little of his drink while ignatius_gallaher finished his boldly beautiful said ignatius_gallaher pausing on the word and on the flavour of his drink
it not so beautiful you know of course it is beautiful but it the life of paris that the thing
ah there no city like paris for gaiety movement excitement little_chandler finished his whisky and after some trouble succeeded in catching the barman eye
i ve been to the moulin rouge ignatius_gallaher continued when the barman had removed their glass and i ve been to all the bohemian cafes
little_chandler said nothing until the barman returned with two glass then he touched his friend glass lightly and reciprocated the former toast
he ordered the same again hot stuff not for a pious chap like you tommy he was beginning to feel somewhat disillusioned
ignatius_gallaher accent and way of expressing himself did not please him there was something vulgar in his friend which he had not observed before
but perhaps it was only the result of living in london amid the bustle and competition of the press the old personal charm was still there under this new gaudy manner
and after all ignatius_gallaher had lived he had seen the world little_chandler looked at his friend enviously everything in paris is gay said ignatius_gallaher
they believe in enjoying life and dont you think they re right if you want to enjoy yourself properly you must go to paris
and mind you they ve a great feeling for the irish there when they heard i was from ireland they were ready to eat me man
little_chandler took four or five sips from his glass tell me he said is it true that paris is so immoral as they say
ignatius_gallaher made a catholic gesture with his right arm every place is immoral he said of course you do find spicy bit in paris
go to one of the students balls for instance that lively if you like when the cocottes begin to let themselves loose
you know what they are i suppose i ve heard of them said little_chandler ignatius_gallaher drank off his whisky and shook his head
ah he said you may say what you like there no woman like the parisienne for style for go then it is an immoral city said little_chandler with timid insistence i mean compared with london or dublin
london said ignatius_gallaher it six of one and half a dozen of the other you ask hogan my boy i showed him a bit about london when he was over there
he open your eye i say tommy dont make punch of that whisky liquor up no really come on another one wont do you any harm
what is it the same again i suppose well all right francois the same again will you smoke tommy ignatius_gallaher produced his cigar case
i ll tell you my opinion said ignatius_gallaher emerging after some time from the clouds of smoke in which he had taken refuge it a rum world
the two friend lit their cigars and puffed at them in silence until their drink were served talk of immorality
ignatius_gallaher puffed thoughtfully at his cigar and then in a calm historian tone he proceeded to sketch for his friend some pictures of the corruption which was rife abroad
i ve heard of case what am i saying i ve known them case of immorality he summarised the vices of many capitals and seemed inclined to award the palm to berlin
some thing he could not vouch for his friend had told him but of other he had had personal experience he spared neither rank nor caste
he revealed many of the secrets of religious house on the continent and described some of the practices which were fashionable in high society and ended by telling with details a story about an english duchess a story which he knew to be true
little_chandler was astonished ah well said ignatius_gallaher here we are in old jog along dublin where nothing is known of such thing
how dull you must find it said little_chandler after all the other place you ve seen well said ignatius_gallaher it a relaxation to come over here you know
and after all it the old country as they say isnt it you cant help having a certain feeling for it
that human nature but tell me something about yourself hogan told me you had tasted the joys of connubial bliss two year ago wasnt it
little_chandler blushed and smiled yes he said i was married last may twelve months i hope it not too late in the day to offer my best wishes said ignatius_gallaher
i didnt know your address or i have done so at the time he extended his hand which little_chandler took
he said i wish you and yours every joy in life old chap and tons of money and may you never die till i shoot you
well tommy and that the wish of a sincere friend an old friend you know that i know that said little_chandler
any youngsters said ignatius_gallaher little_chandler blushed again we have one child he said son or daughter
a little boy ignatius_gallaher slapped his friend sonorously on the back bravo he said i wouldnt doubt you tommy
little_chandler smiled looked confusedly at his glass and bit his lower lip with three childishly white front teeth
i hope you ll spend an evening with us he said before you go back my wife will be delighted to meet you
we can have a little music and thanks awfully old chap said ignatius_gallaher i sorry we didnt meet earlier
you see i over here with another fellow clever young chap he is too and we arranged to go to a little card party
but i must leave tomorrow night tonight perhaps i awfully sorry old man only for that in that case
but who knows said ignatius_gallaher considerately next year i may take a little skip over here now that i ve broken the ice
it only a pleasure deferred very well said little_chandler the next time you come we must have an evening together
that agreed now isnt it yes that agreed said ignatius_gallaher next year if i come parole honneur
and to clinch the bargain said little_chandler we ll just have one more now ignatius_gallaher took out a large gold watch and looked at it
is it to be the last he said because you know i have an a o yes positively said little_chandler
very well then said ignatius_gallaher let us have another one as a deoc an doruis that good vernacular for a small whisky i believe
little_chandler ordered the drink the blush which had risen to his face a few moment before was establishing itself
three small whisky had gone to his head and ignatius_gallaher strong cigar had confused his mind for he was a delicate and abstinent person
the adventure of meeting ignatius_gallaher after eight year of finding himself with ignatius_gallaher in corless surrounded by light and noise of listening to ignatius_gallaher story and of sharing for a brief space ignatius_gallaher vagrant and triumphant life upset the equipoise of his sensitive nature
a trifle made him blush at any time and now he felt warm and excited he felt acutely the contrast between his own life and his friend and it seemed to him unjust
he was sure that he could do something better than his friend had ever done or could ever do something higher than mere tawdry journalism if he only got the chance
ignatius_gallaher was his inferior in birth and education what was it that stood in his way his unfortunate timidity he wished to vindicate himself in some way to assert his manhood
he saw behind ignatius_gallaher refusal of his invitation ignatius_gallaher was only patronising him by his friendliness just as he was patronising ireland by his visit
the barman brought their drink little_chandler pushed one glass towards his friend and took up the other boldly who knows
when you come next year i may have the pleasure of wishing long life and happiness to mr and mrs ignatius_gallaher
he said as they lifted their glass ignatius_gallaher in the act of drinking closed one eye expressively over the rim of his glass
when he had drunk he smacked his lip decisively set down his glass and said no blooming fear of that my boy
i going to have my fling first and see a bit of life and the world before i put my head in the sack if i ever do
some day you will said little_chandler calmly ignatius_gallaher turned his orange tie and slate blue eye full upon his friend
you think so he said you ll put your head in the sack repeated little_chandler stoutly like everyone else if you can find the girl
he had slightly emphasised his tone and he was aware that he had betrayed himself but though the colour had heightened in his cheek he did not flinch from his friend gaze
ignatius_gallaher watched him for a few moment and then said if ever it occurs you may bet your bottom dollar there ll be no mooning and spooning about it
i mean to marry money she ll have a good fat account at the bank or she wont do for me
little_chandler shook his head why man alive said ignatius_gallaher vehemently do you know what it is i ve only to say the word and tomorrow
i can have the woman and the cash you dont believe it well i know it there are hundreds what am i saying thousands of rich germans and jews rotten with money that only be too glad
you wait a while my boy see if i dont play my cards properly when i go about a thing i mean business i tell you
you just wait he tossed his glass to his mouth finished his drink and laughed loudly then he looked thoughtfully before him and said in a calmer tone
but i in no hurry they can wait i dont fancy tying myself up to one woman you know he imitated with his mouth the act of tasting and made a wry face
must get a bit stale i should think he said little_chandler sat in the room off the hall holding a child in his arm
to save money they kept no servant but annie young sister monica came for an hour or so in the morning and an hour or so in the evening to help
little_chandler had come home late for tea and moreover he had forgotten to bring annie home the parcel of coffee from bewley
but monica had gone home long ago it was a quarter to nine of course she was in a bad humour and gave him short answers
she said she would do without any tea but when it came near the time at which the shop at the corner closed she decided to go out herself for a quarter of a pound of tea and two pounds of sugar
a little lamp with a white china shade stood upon the table and its light fell over a photograph which was enclosed in a frame of crumpled horn
she put the sleeping child deftly in his arm and said here dont waken him it was annie photograph little_chandler looked at it pausing at the thin tight lip
she wore the pale blue summer blouse which he had brought her home as a present one saturday it had cost him ten and elevenpence but what an agony of nervousness it had cost him
how he had suffered that day waiting at the shop door until the shop was empty standing at the counter and trying to appear at his ease while the girl piled lady blouses before him paying at the desk and forgetting to take up the odd penny of his change being called back by the cashier and finally striving to hide his blushes as he left the shop by examining the parcel to see if it was securely tied
when he brought the blouse home annie kissed him and said it was very pretty and stylish but when she heard the price she threw the blouse on the table and said it was a regular swindle to charge ten and elevenpence for it
but when she tried it on she was delighted with it especially with the make of the sleeves and kissed him and said he was very good to think of her
at first she wanted to take it back hm he looked coldly into the eye of the photograph and they answered coldly
certainly they were pretty and the face itself was pretty but he found something mean in it why was it so unconscious and ladylike
the composure of the eye irritated him they repelled him and defied him there was no passion in them no rapture
he thought of what ignatius_gallaher had said about rich jewesses those dark oriental eye he thought how full they are of passion of voluptuous longing
why had he married the eye in the photograph he caught himself up at the question and glanced nervously round the room
he found something mean in the pretty furniture which he had bought for his house on the hire system annie had chosen it herself and it reminded him of her
it too was prim and pretty a dull resentment against his life awoke within him could he not escape from his little house
was it too late for him to try to live bravely like ignatius_gallaher could he go to london there was the furniture still to be paid for
if he could only write a book and get it published that might open the way for him a volume of byron poems lay before him on the table
he opened it cautiously with his left hand lest he should waken the child and began to read the first poem in the book
not en a zephyr wanders through the grove whilst i return to view my margaret tomb and scatter flowers on the dust i love
hushed are the winds and still the evening gloom he paused he felt the rhythm of the verse about him in the room
there were so many thing he wanted to describe his sensation of a few hour before on grattan bridge for example
how melancholy it was could he too write like that express the melancholy of his soul in verse if he could get back again into that mood
the child awoke and began to cry he turned from the page and tried to hush it but it would not be hushed
he rocked it faster while his eye began to read the second stanza within this narrow cell reclines her clay that clay where once
he began to rock it to and fro in his arm but its wailing cry grew keener it was useless he couldnt read
he couldnt do anything the wailing of the child pierced the drum of his ear it was useless useless he was a prisoner for life
his arm trembled with anger and suddenly bending to the child face he shouted stop the child stopped for an instant had a spasm of fright and began to scream
he jumped up from his chair and walked hastily up and down the room with the child in his arm it began to sob piteously losing its breath for four or five seconds and then bursting out anew
the thin wall of the room echoed the sound he tried to soothe it but it sobbed more convulsively he looked at the contracted and quivering face of the child and began to be alarmed
he counted seven sobs without a break between them and caught the child to his breast in fright if it died
the door was burst open and a young woman ran in panting what is it what is it she cried
the child hearing its mother voice broke out into a paroxysm of sobbing it nothing annie it nothing he began to cry
she flung her parcels on the floor and snatched the child from him what have you done to him
little_chandler sustained for one moment the gaze of her eye and his heart closed together as he met the hatred in them
she cried glaring into his face he began to stammer it nothing he he began to cry i couldnt i didnt do anything
giving no heed to him she began to walk up and down the room clasping the child tightly in her arm and murmuring
what my little man my little mannie was ou frightened love there now love there now lambabaun mamma little lamb of the world
he listened while the paroxysm of the child sobbing grew less and less and tears of remorse started to his eye
there now little_chandler felt his cheeks suffused with shame and he stood back out of the lamplight counterparts
the bell rang furiously and when miss parker went to the tube a furious voice called out in a piercing north of ireland accent
miss parker returned to her machine saying to a man who was writing at a desk mr_alleyne wants you upstairs
send farrington here the man muttered blast him under his breath and pushed back his chair to stand up when he stood up he was tall and of great bulk
he had a hanging face dark wine coloured with fair eyebrows and moustache his eye bulged forward slightly and the whites of them were dirty
he went heavily upstairs until he came to the second landing where a door bore a brass plate with the inscription mr_alleyne
he lifted up the counter and passing by the clients went out of the office with a heavy step here he halted puffing with labour and vexation and knocked
simultaneously mr_alleyne a little man wearing gold rimmed glass on a cleanshaven face shot his head up over a pile of documents
the shrill voice cried come in the man entered mr_alleyne room the head itself was so pink and hairless it seemed like a large egg reposing on the paper
mr_alleyne did not lose a moment farrington what is the meaning of this why have i always to complain of you
may i ask you why you havent made a copy of that contract between bodley and kirwan i told you it must be ready by four clock
but mr shelley said sir mr shelley said sir kindly attend to what i say and not to what mr shelley says sir
let me tell you that if the contract is not copied before this evening i ll lay the matter before mr crosbie
you have always some excuse or another for shirking work do you hear me now yes sir do you hear me now
understand once for all that you get a half an hour for your lunch and not an hour and a half
ay and another little matter i might as well be talking to the wall as talking to you how many course do you want i like to know
do you mind me now yes sir mr_alleyne bent his head again upon his pile of paper the man stared fixedly at the polished skull which directed the affairs of crosbie alleyne gauging its fragility
a spasm of rage gripped his throat for a few moment and then passed leaving after it a sharp sensation of thirst
the middle of the month was passed and if he could get the copy done in time mr_alleyne might give him an order on the cashier
the man recognised the sensation and felt that he must have a good night drinking he stood still gazing fixedly at the head upon the pile of paper
then as if he had been unaware of the man presence till that moment he shot up his head again saying eh
suddenly mr_alleyne began to upset all the paper searching for something are you going to stand there all day upon my word farrington you take thing easy
the man walked heavily towards the door and as he went out of the room he heard mr_alleyne cry after him that if the contract was not copied by evening mr crosbie would hear of the matter
i was waiting to see very good you neednt wait to see go downstairs and do your work he returned to his desk in the lower office and counted the sheets which remained to be copied
he took up his pen and dipped it in the ink but he continued to stare stupidly at the last word he had written in no case shall the said bernard bodley be
the evening was falling and in a few minute they would be lighting the gas then he could write he felt that he must slake the thirst in his throat
he stood up from his desk and lifting the counter as before passed out of the office as he was passing out the chief clerk looked at him inquiringly
it all right mr shelley said the man pointing with his finger to indicate the objective of his journey the chief clerk glanced at the hat rack but seeing the row complete offered no remark
as soon as he was on the landing the man pulled a shepherd plaid cap out of his pocket put it on his head and ran quickly down the rickety stair
from the street door he walked on furtively on the inner side of the path towards the corner and all at once dived into a doorway
he was now safe in the dark snug of neill shop and filling up the little window that looked into the bar with his inflamed face the colour of dark wine or dark meat he called out here pat give us a p like a good fellow
the curate brought him a glass of plain porter the man drank it at a gulp and asked for a caraway seed
he put his penny on the counter and leaving the curate to grope for it in the gloom retreated out of the snug as furtively as he had entered it
darkness accompanied by a thick fog was gaining upon the dusk of february and the lamp in eustace street had been lit
the man went up by the house until he reached the door of the office wondering whether he could finish his copy in time
on the stair a moist pungent odour of perfumes saluted his nose evidently miss delacour had come while he was out in neill
he crammed his cap back again into his pocket and re entered the office assuming an air of absentmindedness mr_alleyne has been calling for you said the chief clerk severely
the man glanced at the two clients who were standing at the counter as if to intimate that their presence prevented him from answering
where were you as the clients were both male the chief clerk allowed himself a laugh i know that game he said
five time in one day is a little bit well you better look sharp and get a copy of our correspondence in the delacour case for mr_alleyne
this address in the presence of the public his run upstairs and the porter he had gulped down so hastily confused the man and as he sat down at his desk to get what was required he realised how hopeless was the task of finishing his copy of the contract before half past five
the dark damp night was coming and he longed to spend it in the bars drinking with his friend amid the glare of gas and the clatter of glass
he got out the delacour correspondence and passed out of the office he hoped mr_alleyne would not discover that the last two letters were missing
the moist pungent perfume lay all the way up to mr_alleyne room miss delacour was a middle aged woman of jewish appearance
mr_alleyne was said to be sweet on her or on her money she came to the office often and stayed a long time when she came
she was sitting beside his desk now in an aroma of perfumes smoothing the handle of her umbrella and nodding the great black feather in her hat
the man put the correspondence on the desk and bowed respectfully but neither mr_alleyne nor miss delacour took any notice of his bow
mr_alleyne had swivelled his chair round to face her and thrown his right foot jauntily upon his left knee mr_alleyne tapped a finger on the correspondence and then flicked it towards him as if to say
that all right you can go the man returned to the lower office and sat down again at his desk
he stared intently at the incomplete phrase in no case shall the said bernard bodley be and thought how strange it was that the last three word began with the same letter
the man listened to the clicking of the machine for a few minute and then set to work to finish his copy
the chief clerk began to hurry miss parker saying she would never have the letters typed in time for post but his head was not clear and his mind wandered away to the glare and rattle of the public house
it was a night for hot punches he struggled on with his copy but when the clock struck five he had still fourteen pages to write
blast it he couldnt finish it in time he longed to execrate aloud to bring his fist down on something violently
he was so enraged that he wrote bernard bernard instead of bernard bodley and had to begin again on a clean sheet
he felt strong enough to clear out the whole office singlehanded his body ached to do something to rush out and revel in violence
all the indignities of his life enraged him could he ask the cashier privately for an advance no the cashier was no good
no damn good he wouldnt give an advance he knew where he would meet the boy leonard and halloran and nosey flynn
the barometer of his emotional nature was set for a spell of riot his imagination had so abstracted him that his name was called twice before he answered
mr_alleyne and miss delacour were standing outside the counter and all the clerk had turn round in anticipation of something
the man got up from his desk mr_alleyne began a tirade of abuse saying that two letters were missing the man answered that he knew nothing about them that he had made a faithful copy
the tirade continued it was so bitter and violent that the man could hardly restrain his fist from descending upon the head of the manikin before him
i know nothing about any other two letters he said stupidly you know nothing of course you know nothing said mr_alleyne
tell me he added glancing first for approval to the lady beside him do you take me for a fool do you think me an utter fool
the man glanced from the lady face to the little egg shaped head and back again and almost before he was aware of it his tongue had found a felicitous moment i dont think sir he said that that a fair question to put to me
everyone was astounded the author of the witticism no less than his neighbours and miss delacour who was a stout amiable person began to smile broadly
there was a pause in the very breathing of the clerk mr_alleyne flushed to the hue of a wild rose and his mouth twitched with a dwarf passion
he shook his fist in the man face till it seemed to vibrate like the knob of some electric machine you impertinent ruffian
you impertinent ruffian i ll make short work of you wait till you see you ll apologise to me for your impertinence or you ll quit the office instanter
you ll quit this i telling you or you ll apologise to me he stood in a doorway opposite the office watching to see if the cashier would come out alone
all the clerk passed out and finally the cashier came out with the chief clerk it was no use trying to say a word to him when he was with the chief clerk
he had been obliged to offer an abject apology to mr_alleyne for his impertinence but he knew what a hornet nest the office would be for him
he could remember the way in which mr_alleyne had hounded little peake out of the office in order to make room for his own nephew
the man felt that his position was bad enough he felt savage and thirsty and revengeful annoyed with himself and with everyone else
mr_alleyne would never give him an hour rest his life would be a hell to him he had made a proper fool of himself this time
but they had never pulled together from the first he and mr_alleyne ever since the day mr_alleyne had overheard him mimicking his north of ireland accent to amuse higgins and miss parker that had been the beginning of it
could he not keep his tongue in his cheek he might have tried higgins for the money but sure higgins never had anything for himself
a man with two establishments to keep up of course he couldnt he felt his great body again aching for the comfort of the public house
the fog had begun to chill him and he wondered could he touch pat in neill he could not touch him for more than a bob and a bob was no use
yet he must get money somewhere or other he had spent his last penny for the p and soon it would be too late for getting money anywhere
suddenly as he was fingering his watch chain he thought of terry kelly pawn office in fleet street that was the dart why didnt he think of it sooner
he went through the narrow alley of temple bar quickly muttering to himself that they could all go to hell because he was going to have a good night of it
the clerk in terry kelly said a crown but the consignor held out for six shillings and in the end the six shillings was allowed him literally
in westmoreland street the footpaths were crowded with young man and woman returning from business and ragged urchins ran here and there yelling out the name of the evening editions
he came out of the pawn office joyfully making a little cylinder of the coins between his thumb and finger the man passed through the crowd looking on the spectacle generally with proud satisfaction and staring masterfully at the office girl
his head was full of the noise of tram gongs and swishing trolleys and his nose already sniffed the curling fumes of punch
as he walked on he preconsidered the terms in which he would narrate the incident to the boy so i just looked at him coolly you know and looked at her
i dont think that that a fair question to put to me says i nosey flynn was sitting up in his usual corner of davy byrne and when he heard the story he stood farrington a half one saying it was as smart a thing as ever he heard
then i looked back at him again taking my time you know farrington stood a drink in his turn after a while halloran and paddy leonard came in and the story was repeated to them
o halloran stood tailors of malt hot all round and told the story of the retort he had made to the chief clerk when he was in callan of fownes street but as the retort was after the manner of the liberal shepherds in the eclogues he had to admit that it was not as clever as farrington retort
at this farrington told the boy to polish off that and have another just as they were naming their poisons who should come in but higgins
the man asked him to give his version of it and he did so with great vivacity for the sight of five small hot whisky was very exhilarating
of course he had to join in with the other everyone roared laughing when he showed the way in which mr_alleyne shook his fist in farrington face
then he imitated farrington saying and here was my nabs as cool as you please while farrington looked at the company out of his heavy dirty eye smiling and at time drawing forth stray drops of liquor from his moustache with the aid of his lower lip
o halloran had money but neither of the other two seemed to have any so the whole party left the shop somewhat regretfully
at the corner of duke street higgins and nosey flynn bevelled off to the left while the other three turned back towards the city
when that round was over there was a pause rain was drizzling down on the cold street and when they reached the ballast office farrington suggested the scotch house
the three man pushed past the whining match sellers at the door and formed a little party at the corner of the counter
leonard introduced them to a young fellow named weathers who was performing at the tivoli as an acrobat and knockabout artiste
the bar was full of man and loud with the noise of tongue and glass they began to exchange story farrington stood a drink all round
farrington who had definite notions of what was what asked the boy would they have an apollinaris too but the boy told tim to make theirs hot
weathers said he would take a small irish and apollinaris the talk became theatrical halloran stood a round and then farrington stood another round weathers protesting that the hospitality was too irish
o halloran said that he and leonard would go but that farrington wouldnt go because he was a married man and farrington heavy dirty eye leered at the company in token that he understood he was being chaffed
weathers made them all have just one little tincture at his expense and promised to meet them later on at mulligan in poolbeg street
he promised to get them in behind the scenes and introduce them to some nice girl when the scotch house closed they went round to mulligan
they went into the parlour at the back and halloran ordered small hot specials all round they were all beginning to feel mellow
farrington was just standing another round when weathers came back much to farrington relief he drank a glass of bitter this time
presently two young woman with big hat and a young man in a check suit came in and sat at a table close by
funds were getting low but they had enough to keep them going weathers saluted them and told the company that they were out of the tivoli
farrington eye wandered at every moment in the direction of one of the young woman there was something striking in her appearance
an immense scarf of peacock blue muslin was wound round her hat and knotted in a great bow under her chin and she wore bright yellow gloves reaching to the elbow
farrington gazed admiringly at the plump arm which she moved very often and with much grace and when after a little time she answered his gaze he admired still more her large dark brown eye
she glanced at him once or twice and when the party was leaving the room she brushed against his chair and said pardon in a london accent
the oblique staring expression in them fascinated him he watched her leave the room in the hope that she would look back at him but he was disappointed
he cursed his want of money and cursed all the round he had stood particularly all the whisky and apolinaris which he had stood to weathers
if there was one thing that he hated it was a sponge he was so angry that he lost count of the conversation of his friend
weathers was showing his biceps muscle to the company and boasting so much that the other two had called on farrington to uphold the national honour
when paddy leonard called him he found that they were talking about feats of strength farrington pulled up his sleeve accordingly and showed his biceps muscle to the company
the two arm were examined and compared and finally it was agreed to have a trial of strength the table was cleared and the two man rested their elbows on it clasping hand
when paddy leonard said go each was to try to bring down the other hand on to the table farrington looked very serious and determined
the trial began after about thirty seconds weathers brought his opponent hand slowly down on to the table farrington dark wine coloured face flushed darker still with anger and humiliation at having been defeated by such a stripling
you re not to put the weight of your body behind it play fair he said who not playing fair said the other
come on again the two best out of three the trial began again the veins stood out on farrington forehead and the pallor of weathers complexion changed to peony
their hand and arm trembled under the stress after a long struggle weathers again brought his opponent hand slowly on to the table
there was a murmur of applause from the spectators the curate who was standing beside the table nodded his red head towards the victor and said with stupid familiarity
ah that the knack what the hell do you know about it said farrington fiercely turning on the man
what do you put in your gab for sh sh said halloran observing the violent expression of farrington face
a very sullen faced man stood at the corner of connell bridge waiting for the little sandymount tram to take him home
pony up boy we ll have just one little smahan more and then we ll be off he was full of smouldering anger and revengefulness
he felt humiliated and discontented he did not even feel drunk and he had only twopence in his pocket he cursed everything
he had done for himself in the office pawned his watch spent all his money and he had not even got drunk
he began to feel thirsty again and he longed to be back again in the hot reeking public house he had lost his reputation as a strong man having been defeated twice by a mere boy
his heart swelled with fury and when he thought of the woman in the big hat who had brushed against him and said pardon
his tram let him down at shelbourne road and he steered his great body along in the shadow of the wall of the barracks
his fury nearly choked him he loathed returning to his home when he went in by the side door he found the kitchen empty and the kitchen fire nearly out
his wife was a little sharp faced woman who bullied her husband when he was sober and was bullied by him when he was drunk
he bawled upstairs ada ada they had five child a little boy came running down the stair who is that said the man peering through the darkness
me pa who are you charlie no pa tom_burke where your mother she out at the chapel
that right did she think of leaving any dinner for me yes pa i light the lamp what do you mean by having the place in darkness
are the other child in bed the man sat down heavily on one of the chair while the little boy lit the lamp
he began to mimic his son flat accent saying half to himself at the chapel at the chapel if you please
when the lamp was lit he banged his fist on the table and shouted what for my dinner i going to cook it pa said the little boy
the man jumped up furiously and pointed to the fire on that fire you let the fire out by god i ll teach you to do that again
he took a step to the door and seized the walking stick which was standing behind it i ll teach you to let the fire out
the little boy cried pa and ran whimpering round the table but the man followed him and caught him by the coat
he said rolling up his sleeve in order to give his arm free play the little boy looked about him wildly but seeing no way of escape fell upon his knees
now you ll let the fire out the next time said the man striking at him vigorously with the stick
take that you little whelp the boy uttered a squeal of pain as the stick cut his thigh he clasped his hand together in the air and his voice shook with fright
pa he cried dont beat me pa and i ll i ll say a hail mary_jane for you i ll say a hail mary_jane for you pa if you dont beat me
the matron had given her leave to go out as soon as the woman tea was over and maria looked forward to her evening out
i ll say a hail mary_jane clay the kitchen was spick and span the cook said you could see yourself in the big copper boilers
these barmbracks seemed uncut but if you went closer you would see that they had been cut into long thick even slices and were ready to be handed round at tea
the fire was nice and bright and on one of the side table were four very big barmbracks maria had cut them herself
maria was a very very small person indeed but she had a very long nose and a very long chin she talked a little through her nose always soothingly
yes my dear and no my dear she was always sent for when the woman quarrelled over their tubs and always succeeded in making peace
one day the matron had said to her maria you are a veritable peace maker and the sub matron and two of the board lady had heard the compliment
and ginger mrs_mooney was always saying what she wouldnt do to the dummy who had charge of the irons if it wasnt for maria
everyone was so fond of maria the woman would have their tea at six clock and she would be able to get away before seven
from ballsbridge to the pillar twenty minute from the pillar to drumcondra twenty minute and twenty minute to buy the thing
she would be there before eight she took out her purse with the silver clasps and read again the word a present from belfast
she was very fond of that purse because joe_dillon had brought it to her five year before when he and alphy had gone to belfast on a whit monday trip
in the purse were two half crowns and some coppers she would have five shillings clear after paying tram fare what a nice evening they would have all the child singing
often he had wanted her to go and live with them but she would have felt herself in the way though joe_dillon wife was ever so nice with her and she had become accustomed to the life of the laundry
only she hoped that joe_dillon wouldnt come in drunk he was so different when he took any drink joe_dillon was a good fellow
she had nursed him and alphy too and joe_dillon used often say mamma is mamma but maria is my proper mother
after the break up at home the boy had got her that position in the dublin by lamplight laundry and she liked it
she used to have such a bad opinion of protestants but now she thought they were very nice people a little quiet and serious but still very nice people to live with
she had lovely ferns and wax plants and whenever anyone came to visit her she always gave the visitor one or two slips from her conservatory
there was one thing she didnt like and that was the tracts on the walks but the matron was such a nice person to deal with so genteel
when the cook told her everything was ready she went into the woman room and began to pull the big bell
in a few minute the woman began to come in by twos and threes wiping their steaming hand in their petticoats and pulling down the sleeves of their blouses over their red steaming arm
they settled down before their huge mugs which the cook and the dummy filled up with hot tea already mixed with milk and sugar in huge tin cans
then she had her plants in the conservatory and she liked looking after them maria superintended the distribution of the barmbrack and saw that every woman got her four slices
lizzie fleming said maria was sure to get the ring and though fleming had said that for so many hallow eves maria had to laugh and say she didnt want any ring or man either and when she laughed her grey green eye sparkled with disappointed shyness and the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin
then ginger mrs_mooney lifted her mug of tea and proposed maria health while all the other woman clattered with their mugs on the table and said she was sorry she hadnt a sup of porter to drink it in
there was a great deal of laughing and joking during the meal and maria laughed again till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin and till
her minute body nearly shook itself asunder because she knew that mrs_mooney meant well though of course she had the notions of a common woman
but wasnt maria glad when the woman had finished their tea and the cook and the dummy had begun to clear away the tea thing
she went into her little bedroom and remembering that the next morning was a mass morning changed the hand of the alarm from seven to six
then she took off her working skirt and her house boots and laid her best skirt out on the bed and her tiny dress boots beside the foot of the bed
she changed her blouse too and as she stood before the mirror she thought of how she used to dress for mass on sunday morning when she was a young girl and she looked with quaint affection at the diminutive body which she had so often adorned
in spite of its year she found it a nice tidy little body when she got outside the street were shining with rain and she was glad of her old brown waterproof
the tram was full and she had to sit on the little stool at the end of the car facing all the people with her toes barely touching the floor
she arranged in her mind all she was going to do and thought how much better it was to be independent and to have your own money in your pocket
she hoped they would have a nice evening she was sure they would but she could not help thinking what a pity it was alphy and joe_dillon were not speaking
they were always falling out now but when they were boy together they used to be the best of friend but such was life
she went into downes cake shop but the shop was so full of people that it was a long time before she could get herself attended to
she bought a dozen of mixed penny cakes and at last came out of the shop laden with a big bag
she got out of her tram at the pillar and ferreted her way quickly among the crowd then she thought what else would she buy she wanted to buy something really nice
they would be sure to have plenty of apples and nuts it was hard to know what to buy and all she could think of was cake
she decided to buy some plumcake but downes plumcake had not enough almond icing on top of it so she went over to a shop in henry street
here she was a long time in suiting herself and the stylish young lady behind the counter who was evidently a little annoyed by her asked her was it wedding cake she wanted to buy
that made maria blush and smile at the young lady but the young lady took it all very seriously and finally cut a thick slice of plumcake parcelled it up and said two and four please
she thought she would have to stand in the drumcondra tram because none of the young man seemed to notice her but an elderly gentleman made room for her
he was a stout gentleman and he wore a brown hard hat he had a square red face and a greyish moustache
maria thought he was a colonel looking gentleman and she reflected how much more polite he was than the young man who simply stared straight before them
he supposed the bag was full of good thing for the little one and said it was only right that the youngsters should enjoy themselves while they were young
the gentleman began to chat with her about hallow eve and the rainy weather maria agreed with him and favoured him with demure nods and hems
he was very nice with her and when she was getting out at the canal bridge she thanked him and bowed and he bowed to her and raised his hat and smiled agreeably and
while she was going up along the terrace bending her tiny head under the rain she thought how easy it was to know a gentleman even when he has a drop taken
everybody said here maria when she came to joe_dillon house joe_dillon was there having come home from business and all the child had their sunday dress on
there were two big girl in from next door and game were going on maria gave the bag of cakes to the eldest boy alphy to divide and
mrs_donnelly said it was too good of her to bring such a big bag of cakes and made all the child say
but maria said she had brought something special for papa and mamma something they would be sure to like and she began to look for her plumcake
thanks maria she tried in downes bag and then in the pocket of her waterproof and then on the hallstand
then she asked all the child had any of them eaten it by mistake of course but the child all said no and looked as if they did not like to eat cakes if they were to be accused of stealing
everybody had a solution for the mystery and mrs_donnelly said it was plain that maria had left it behind her in the tram
but nowhere could she find it maria remembering how confused the gentleman with the greyish moustache had made her coloured with shame and vexation and disappointment
at the thought of the failure of her little surprise and of the two and fourpence she had thrown away for nothing she nearly cried outright
he told her all that went on in his office repeating for her a smart answer which he had made to the manager
but joe_dillon said it didnt matter and made her sit down by the fire he was very nice with her maria did not understand why joe_dillon laughed so much over the answer he had made
joe_dillon said he wasnt so bad when you knew how to take him that he was a decent sort so long as you didnt rub him the wrong way
but she said that the manager must have been a very overbearing person to deal with mrs_donnelly played the piano for the child and they danced and sang
nobody could find the nutcrackers and joe_dillon was nearly getting cross over it and asked how did they expect maria to crack nuts without a nutcracker
then the two next door girl handed round the nuts but maria said she didnt like nuts and that they werent to bother about her
then joe_dillon asked would she take a bottle of stout and mrs_donnelly said there was port wine too in the house if she would prefer that
so maria let him have his way and they sat by the fire talking over old time and maria thought she would put in a good word for alphy
but joe_dillon cried that god might strike him stone dead if ever he spoke a word to his brother again and maria said she was sorry she had mentioned the matter
mrs_donnelly told her husband it was a great shame for him to speak that way of his own flesh and blood
but joe_dillon said that alphy was no brother of his and there was nearly being a row on the head of it
but joe_dillon said he would not lose his temper on account of the night it was and asked his wife to open some more stout
maria said she would rather they didnt ask her to take anything but joe_dillon insisted the two next door girl had arranged some hallow eve game and soon everything was merry again
maria was delighted to see the child so merry and joe_dillon and his wife in such good spirits the next door girl put some saucers on the table and then led the child up to the table blindfold
one got the prayer book and the other three got the water and when one of the next door girl got the ring mrs_donnelly shook her finger at the blushing girl as much as to say i know all about it
they insisted then on blindfolding maria and leading her up to the table to see what she would get and while they were putting on the bandage maria laughed and laughed again till the tip of her nose nearly met the tip of her chin
they led her up to the table amid laughing and joking and she put her hand out in the air as she was told to do
she moved her hand about here and there in the air and descended on one of the saucers she felt a soft wet substance with her finger and was surprised that nobody spoke or took off her bandage
somebody said something about the garden and at last mrs_donnelly said something very cross to one of the next door girl and told her to throw it out at once that was no play
there was a pause for a few seconds and then a great deal of scuffling and whispering maria understood that it was wrong that time
and so she had to do it over again and this time she got the prayer book after that mrs_donnelly played miss mccloud reel for the child and joe_dillon made maria take a glass of wine
soon they were all quite merry again and mrs_donnelly said maria would enter a convent before the year was out because she had got the prayer book
maria had never seen joe_dillon so nice to her as he was that night so full of pleasant talk and reminiscences
at last the child grew tired and sleepy and joe_dillon asked maria would she not sing some little song before she went one of the old songs
she said they were all very good to her mrs_donnelly said do please maria and so maria had to get up and stand beside the piano
then she played the prelude and said now maria and maria blushing very much began to sing in a tiny quavering voice
mrs_donnelly bade the child be quiet and listen to maria song she sang i dreamt that i dwelt and when she came to the second verse she sang again
i dreamt that i dwelt in marble hall with vassals and serfs at my side and of all who assembled within those wall that i was the hope and the pride
i had riches too great to count could boast of a high ancestral name but i also dreamt which pleased me most that you loved me still the same
but no one tried to show her her mistake and when she had ended her song joe_dillon was very much moved
he said that there was no time like the long ago and no music for him like poor old balfe whatever other people might say and his eye filled up so much with tears that he could not find what he was looking for and in the end he had to ask his wife to tell him where the corkscrew was
james duffy lived in chapelizod because he wished to live as far as possible from the city of which he was a citizen and because he found all the other suburbs of dublin mean modern and pretentious
he lived in an old sombre house and from his window he could look into the disused distillery or upwards along the shallow river on which dublin is built
a painful case mr the lofty wall of his uncarpeted room were free from pictures he had himself bought every article of furniture in the room
a black iron bedstead an iron washstand four cane chair a clothes rack a coal scuttle a fender and irons and a square table on which lay a double desk
a bookcase had been made in an alcove by means of shelves of white wood the bed was clothed with white bedclothes and a black and scarlet rug covered the foot
a little hand mirror hung above the washstand and during the day a white shaded lamp stood as the sole ornament of the mantelpiece
the book on the white wooden shelves were arranged from below upwards according to bulk a complete wordsworth stood at one end of the lowest shelf and a copy of the maynooth the top shelf
in the desk lay a manuscript translation of hauptmann michael kramer the stage directions of which were written in purple ink and a little sheaf of paper held together by a brass pin
in these sheets a sentence was inscribed from time to time and in an ironical moment the headline of an advertisement for bile beans had been pasted on to the first sheet
on lifting the lid of the desk a faint fragrance escaped the fragrance of new cedarwood pencils or of a bottle of gum or of an overripe apple which might have been left there and forgotten
writing materials were always on the desk mr duffy abhorred anything which betokened physical or mental disorder a mediaeval doctor would have called him saturnine
on his long and rather large head grew dry black hair and a tawny moustache did not quite cover an unamiable mouth
his cheekbones also gave his face a harsh character but there was no harshness in the eye which looking at the world from under their tawny eyebrows gave the impression of a man ever alert to greet a redeeming instinct in other but often disappointed
his face which carried the entire tale of his year was of the brown tint of dublin street he lived at a little distance from his body regarding his own acts with doubtful side glances
he had an odd autobiographical habit which led him to compose in his mind from time to time a short sentence about himself containing a subject in the third person and a predicate in the past tense
he never gave alms to beggars and walked firmly carrying a stout hazel he had been for many year cashier of a private bank in baggot street
at midday he went to dan tom_burke and took his lunch a bottle of lager beer and a small trayful of arrowroot biscuits
he dined in an eating house in george street where he felt himself safe from the society of dublin gilded youth and where there was a certain plain honesty in the bill of fare
every morning he came in from chapelizod by tram at four clock he was set free his evening were spent either before his landlady piano or roaming about the outskirts of the city
his liking for mozart music brought him sometimes to an opera or a concert these were the only dissipations of his life
he lived his spiritual life without any communion with other visiting his relatives at christmas and escorting them to the cemetery when they died
he performed these two social duties for old dignity sake but conceded nothing further to the conventions which regulate the civic life
he allowed himself to think that in certain circumstances he would rob his hank but as these circumstances never arose his life rolled out evenly an adventureless tale
he had neither companions nor friend church nor creed one evening he found himself sitting beside two lady in the rotunda
the lady who sat next him looked round at the deserted house once or twice and then said what a pity there is such a poor house tonight
the house thinly peopled and silent gave distressing prophecy of failure it so hard on people to have to sing to empty benches
he took the remark as an invitation to talk he was surprised that she seemed so little awkward while they talked he tried to fix her permanently in his memory
when he learned that the young girl beside her was her daughter he judged her to be a year or so younger than himself
her face which must have been handsome had remained intelligent it was an oval face with strongly marked features the eye were very dark blue and steady
their gaze began with a defiant note but was confused by what seemed a deliberate swoon of the pupil into the iris revealing for an instant a temperament of great sensibility
the pupil reasserted itself quickly this half disclosed nature fell again under the reign of prudence and her astrakhan jacket moulding a bosom of a certain fullness struck the note of defiance more definitely
he met her again a few week afterwards at a concert in earlsfort terrace and seized the moment when her daughter attention was diverted to become intimate
she alluded once or twice to her husband but her tone was not such as to make the allusion a warning
her name was mrs sinico her husband great great grandfather had come from leghorn her husband was captain of a mercantile boat plying between dublin and holland and they had one child
this was the first of many meetings they met always in the evening and chose the most quiet quarters for their walks together
mr duffy however had a distaste for underhand way and finding that they were compelled to meet stealthily he forced her to ask him to her house
meeting her a third time by accident he found courage to make an appointment she came captain sinico encouraged his visits thinking that his daughter hand was in question
he had dismissed his wife so sincerely from his gallery of pleasures that he did not suspect that anyone else would take an interest in her
as the husband was often away and the daughter out giving music lessons mr duffy had many opportunities of enjoying the lady society
neither he nor she had had any such adventure before and neither was conscious of any incongruity little by little he entangled his thought with hers
he lent her book provided her with idea shared his intellectual life with her she listened to all sometimes in return for his theories she gave out some fact of her own life
he told her that for some time he had assisted at the meetings of an irish socialist party where he had felt himself a unique figure amidst a score of sober workmen in a garret lit by an inefficient oil lamp
when the party had divided into three sections each under its own leader and in its own garret he had discontinued his attendances
with almost maternal solicitude she urged him to let his nature open to the full she became his confessor the workmen discussions he said were too timorous the interest they took in the question of wages was inordinate
he felt that they were hard featured realists and that they resented an exactitude which was the produce of a leisure not within their reach
no social revolution he told her would be likely to strike dublin for some centuries she asked him why did he not write out his thought
to submit himself to the criticisms of an obtuse middle class which entrusted its morality to policemen and its fine arts to impresarios
for what he asked her with careful scorn to compete with phrasemongers incapable of thinking consecutively for sixty seconds he went often to her little cottage outside dublin often they spent their evening alone
little by little as their thought entangled they spoke of subjects less remote her companionship was like a warm soil about an exotic
many time she allowed the dark to fall upon them refraining from lighting the lamp the dark discreet room their isolation the music that still vibrated in their ear united them
this union exalted him wore away the rough edges of his character emotionalised his mental life sometimes he caught himself listening to the sound of his own voice
he thought that in her eye he would ascend to an angelical stature and as he attached the fervent nature of his companion more and more closely to him he heard the strange impersonal voice which he recognised as his own insisting on the soul incurable loneliness
the end of these discourses was that one night during which she had shown every sign of unusual excitement mrs sinico caught up his hand passionately and pressed it to her cheek
we cannot give ourselves it said we are our own mr duffy was very much surprised her interpretation of his word disillusioned him
as he did not wish their last interview to be troubled by the influence of their ruined confessional they met in a little cakeshop near the parkgate
it was cold autumn weather but in spite of the cold they wandered up and down the road of the park for nearly three hour
he did not visit her for a week then he wrote to her asking her to meet him they agreed to break off their intercourse every bond he said is a bond to sorrow
when they came out of the park they walked in silence towards the tram but here she began to tremble so violently that fearing another collapse on her part he bade her
good bye quickly and left her a few day later he received a parcel containing his book and music four year passed
some new piece of music encumbered the music stand in the lower room and on his shelves stood two volumes by nietzsche
mr duffy returned to his even way of life his room still bore witness of the orderliness of his mind thus spake zarathustra and the gay science
one of his sentences written two months after his last interview with mrs sinico read love between man and man is impossible because there must not be sexual intercourse and friendship between man and woman
he wrote seldom in the sheaf of paper which lay in his desk is impossible because there must be sexual intercourse
and still every morning he went into the city by tram and every evening walked home from the city after having dined moderately in george street and read the evening paper for dessert
one evening as he was about to put a morsel of corned beef and cabbage into his mouth his hand stopped
he kept away from concert lest he should meet her his father died the junior partner of the bank retired his eye fixed themselves on a paragraph in the evening paper which he had propped against the water carafe
then he drank a glass of water pushed his plate to one side doubled the paper down before him between his elbows and read the paragraph over and over again
he replaced the morsel of food on his plate and read the paragraph attentively the cabbage began to deposit a cold white grease on his plate
the girl came over to him to ask was his dinner not properly cooked he said it was very good and ate a few mouthfuls of it with difficulty
he walked along quickly through the november twilight his stout hazel stick striking the ground regularly the fringe of the buff mail peeping out of a side pocket of his tight reefer overcoat
then he paid his bill and went out on the lonely road which leads from the parkgate to chapelizod he slackened his pace
his stick struck the ground less emphatically and his breath issuing irregularly almost with a sighing sound condensed in the wintry air
when he reached his house he went up at once to his bedroom and taking the paper from his pocket read the paragraph again by the failing light of the window
this was the paragraph death of a lady at sydney parade a painful case today at the city of dublin hospital
the deputy coroner in the absence of mr leverett held an inquest on the body of mrs emily sinico aged forty three year who was killed at sydney parade station yesterday evening
the evidence showed that the deceased lady while attempting to cross the line was knocked down by the engine of the ten clock slow train from kingstown thereby sustaining injuries of the head and right side which led to her death
james lennon driver of the engine stated that he had been in the employment of the railway company for fifteen year
on hearing the guard whistle he set the train in motion and a second or two afterwards brought it to rest in response to loud cries
he read it not aloud but moving his lip as a priest does when he reads the prayers secreto the train was going slowly
p dunne railway porter stated that as the train was about to start he observed a woman attempting to cross the lines
he ran towards her and shouted but before he could reach her she was caught by the buffer of the engine and fell to the ground
a juror you saw the lady fall witness yes police sergeant croly deposed that when he arrived he found the deceased lying on the platform apparently dead
dr halpin assistant house surgeon of the city of dublin hospital stated that the deceased had two lower ribs fractured and had sustained severe contusions of the right shoulder
he had the body taken to the waiting room pending the arrival of the ambulance constable corroborated the right side of the head had been injured in the fall
the injuries were not sufficient to have caused death in a normal person death in his opinion had been probably due to shock and sudden failure of the heart action
the company had always taken every precaution to prevent people crossing the lines except by the bridges both by placing notices in every station and by the use of patent spring gates at level crossings
the deceased had been in the habit of crossing the lines late at night from platform to platform and in view of certain other circumstances of the case he did not think the railway officials were to blame
mr b patterson finlay on behalf of the railway company expressed his deep regret at the accident captain sinico of leoville sydney parade husband of the deceased also gave evidence
he stated that the deceased was his wife he was not in dublin at the time of the accident as he had arrived only that morning from rotterdam
they had been married for twenty two year and had lived happily until about two year ago when his wife began to be rather intemperate in her habits
miss mary_jane sinico said that of late her mother had been in the habit of going out at night to buy spirits
she witness had often tried to reason with her mother and had induced her to join a league she was not at home until an hour after the accident
the jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence and exonerated lennon from all blame the deputy coroner said it was a most painful case and expressed great sympathy with captain sinico and his daughter
he urged on the railway company to take strong measures to prevent the possibility of similar accidents in the future no blame attached to anyone
the river lay quiet beside the empty distillery and from time to time a light appeared in some house on the lucan road
mr duffy raised his eye from the paper and gazed out of his window on the cheerless evening landscape what an end
the whole narrative of her death revolted him and it revolted him to think that he had ever spoken to her of what he held sacred
the threadbare phrases the inane expression of sympathy the cautious word of a reporter won over to conceal the details of a commonplace vulgar death attacked his stomach
not merely had she degraded herself she had degraded him he saw the squalid tract of her vice miserable and malodorous
his soul companion he thought of the hobbling wretches whom he had seen carrying cans and bottle to be filled by the barman
evidently she had been unfit to live without any strength of purpose an easy prey to habits one of the wrecks on which civilisation has been reared
just god what an end but that she could have sunk so low was it possible he had deceived himself so utterly about her
he remembered her outburst of that night and interpreted it in a harsher sense than he had ever done he had no difficulty now in approving of the course he had taken
as the light failed and his memory began to wander he thought her hand touched his the shock which had first attacked his stomach was now attacking his nerves
he put on his overcoat and hat quickly and went out the cold air met him on the threshold it crept into the sleeves of his coat
when he came to the public house at chapelizod bridge he went in and ordered a hot punch the proprietor served him obsequiously but did not venture to talk
they drank at intervals from their huge pint tumblers and smoked spitting often on the floor and sometimes dragging the sawdust over their spits with their heavy boots
there were five or six workingmen in the shop discussing the value of a gentleman estate in county kildare mr duffy sat on his stool and gazed at them without seeing or hearing them
after a while they went out and he called for another punch he sat a long time over it the shop was very quiet
the proprietor sprawled on the counter reading the herald and yawning now and again a tram was heard swishing along the lonely road outside
as he sat there living over his life with her and evoking alternately the two images in which he now conceived her he realised that she was dead that she had ceased to exist that she had become a memory
he began to feel ill at ease he asked himself what else could he have done he could not have carried on a comedy of deception with her he could not have lived with her openly
he had done what seemed to him best how was he to blame now that she was gone he understood how lonely her life must have been sitting night after night alone in that room
his life would be lonely too until he too died ceased to exist became a memory if anyone remembered him it was after nine clock when he left the shop
the night was cold and gloomy he entered the park by the first gate and walked along under the gaunt trees
he walked through the bleak alleys where they had walked four year before she seemed to be near him in the darkness
at moment he seemed to feel her voice touch his ear her hand touch his he stood still to listen why had he withheld life from her
when he gained the crest of the magazine hill he halted and looked along the river towards dublin the light of which burned redly and hospitably in the cold night
he looked down the slope and at the base in the shadow of the wall of the park he saw some human figure lying
why had he sentenced her to death he felt his moral nature falling to piece those venal and furtive loves filled him with despair
one human being had seemed to love him and he had denied her life and happiness he had sentenced her to ignominy a death of shame
he gnawed the rectitude of his life he felt that he had been outcast from life feast he knew that the prostrate creatures down by the wall were watching him and wished him gone
no one wanted him he was outcast from life feast he turned his eye to the grey gleaming river winding along towards dublin
beyond the river he saw a goods train winding out of kingsbridge station like a worm with a fiery head winding through the darkness obstinately and laboriously
it passed slowly out of sight but still he heard in his ear the laborious drone of the engine reiterating the syllables of her name
he turned back the way he had come the rhythm of the engine pounding in his ear he began to doubt the reality of what memory told him
he halted under a tree and allowed the rhythm to die away he could not feel her near him in the darkness nor her voice touch his ear
he waited for some minute listening he could hear nothing the night was perfectly silent he listened again perfectly silent he felt that he was alone
room old jack_mooney raked the cinders together with a piece of cardboard and spread them judiciously over the whitening dome of coals
when the dome was thinly covered his face lapsed into darkness but as he set himself to fan the fire again his crouching shadow ascended the opposite wall and his face slowly re emerged into light
the moist blue eye blinked at the fire and the moist mouth fell open at time munching once or twice mechanically when it closed
when the cinders had caught he laid the piece of cardboard against the wall sighed and said that better now mr connor
mr connor a grey haired young man whose face was disfigured by many blotches and pimples had just brought the tobacco for a cigarette into a shapely cylinder but when spoken to he undid his handiwork meditatively
ivy day in the committee it was an old man face very bony and hairy then he began to roll the tobacco again meditatively and after a moment thought decided to lick the paper
did mr tierney say when he be back he asked in a husky falsetto he didnt say
mr connor put his cigarette into his mouth and began search his pocket he took out a pack of thin pasteboard cards
i ll get you a match said the old man never mind this ll do said mr connor he selected one of the cards and read what was printed on it municipal elections
mr richard tierney l respectfully solicits the favour of your vote and influence at the coming election in the royal exchange ward
mr connor had been engaged by tierney agent to canvass one part of the ward but as the weather was inclement and his boots let in the wet he spent a great part of the day sitting by the fire in the committee room in wicklow street with jack_mooney the old caretaker
royal exchange ward they had been sitting thus since the short day had grown dark it was the sixth of october dismal and cold out of door
mr connor tore a strip off the card and lighting it lit his cigarette as he did so the flame lit up a leaf of dark glossy ivy the lapel of his coat
the old man watched him attentively and then taking up the piece of cardboard again began to fan the fire slowly while his companion smoked
ah yes he said continuing it hard to know what way to bring up child now who think he turn out like that
i sent him to the christian brothers and i done what i could for him and there he goes boosing about
i tried to make him someway decent he replaced the cardboard wearily only i an old man now i change his tune for him
i take the stick to his back and beat him while i could stand over him as i done many a time before
the mother you know she cocks him up with this and that that what ruins child said mr connor
to be sure it is said the old man and little thanks you get for it only impudence he takes th upper hand of me whenever he sees i ve a sup taken
what the world coming to when son speaks that way to their father what age is he said mr connor
nineteen said the old man why dont you put him to something sure amnt i never done at the drunken bowsy ever since he left school
i wont keep you i says you must get a job for yourself but sure it worse whenever he gets a job he drink it all
mr connor shook his head in sympathy and the old man fell silent gazing into the fire someone opened the door of the room and called out
hello is this a freemasons meeting who that said the old man what are you doing in the dark asked a voice
is that you mr_hynes asked mr connor yes what are you doing in the dark said mr_hynes advancing into the light of the fire
imminent little drops of rain hung at the brim of his hat and the collar of his jacket coat was turned up
he was a tall slender young man with a light brown moustache well mat he said to mr connor how goes it
the old man left the hearth and after stumbling about the room returned with two candlesticks which he thrust one after the other into the fire and carried to the table
mr connor shook his head a denuded room came into view and the fire lost all its cheerful colour the wall of the room were bare except for a copy of an election address
in the middle of the room was a small table on which paper were heaped mr_hynes leaned against the mantelpiece and asked has he paid you yet
not yet said mr connor i hope to god he ll not leave us in the lurch tonight mr_hynes laughed
he ll pay you never fear he said i hope he ll look smart about it if he means business said mr connor
what do you think jack_mooney said mr_hynes satirically to the old man the old man returned to his seat by the fire saying it isnt but he has it anyway
not like the other tinker what other tinker said mr_hynes colgan said the old man scornfully it is because colgan a working man you say that
hasnt the working man as good a right to be in the corporation as anyone else ay and a better right than those shoneens that are always hat in hand before any fellow with a handle to his name
what the difference between a good honest bricklayer and a publican eh isnt that so mat said mr_hynes addressing mr connor
i think you re right said mr connor one man is a plain honest man with no hunker sliding about him
he goes in to represent the labour classes this fellow you re working for only wants to get some job or other
of course the working classes should be represented said the old man the working man said mr_hynes gets all kicks and no halfpence
but it labour produces everything the working man is not looking for fat jobs for his son and nephews and cousins the working man is not going to drag the honour of dublin in the mud to please a german monarch
how that said the old man dont you know they want to present an address of welcome to edward rex if he comes here next year
what do we want kowtowing to a foreign king our man wont vote for the address said mr connor
he goes in on the nationalist ticket wont he said mr_hynes wait till you see whether he will or not
i know him is it tricky dicky tierney by god perhaps you re right joe_dillon said mr connor anyway i wish he turn up with the spondulics
mr_hynes took off his hat shook it and then turned down the collar of his coat displaying as he did so an ivy leaf in the lapel
the three man fell silent the old man began to rake more cinders together if this man was alive he said pointing to the leaf we have no talk of an address of welcome
that true said mr connor musha god be with them time said the old man there was some life in it then
the room was silent again then a bustling little man with a snuffling nose and very cold ear pushed in the door
he walked over quickly to the fire rubbing his hand as if he intended to produce a spark from them
o dont stir jack_mooney dont stir said mr_henchy he nodded curtly to mr_hynes and sat down on the chair which the old man vacated
no money boy he said sit down here mr_henchy said the old man offering him his chair
did you serve aungier street he asked mr connor yes said mr connor beginning to search his pocket for memoranda
did you call on grimes i did well how does he stand he wouldnt promise he said i wont tell anyone what way i going to vote
but i think he ll be all right why so he asked me who the nominators were and i told him
i mentioned father tom_burke name i think it ll be all right mr_henchy began to snuffle and to rub his hand over the fire at a terrific speed
then he said for the love of god jack_mooney bring us a bit of coal there must be some left
the old man went out of the room it no go said mr_henchy shaking his head i asked the little shoeboy but he said oh now mr_henchy when i see work going on properly

but is that a fact asked mr connor god yes said mr_henchy did you never hear that
and the man used to go in on sunday morning before the house were open to buy a waistcoat or a trousers moya
but tricky dicky little old father always had a tricky little black bottle up in a corner do you mind now
that that that where he first saw the light the old man returned with a few lumps of coal which he placed here and there on the fire
thats a nice how do you do said mr connor how does he expect us to work for him if he wont stump up
i cant help it said mr_henchy i expect to find the bailiffs in the hall when i go home
mr_hynes laughed and shoving himself away from the mantelpiece with the aid of his shoulder made ready to leave
it ll be all right when king eddie comes he said well boy i off for the present see you later
neither mr_henchy nor the old man said anything but just as the door was closing mr connor who had been staring moodily into the fire called out suddenly
bye bye he went out of the room slowly bye joe_dillon mr_henchy waited a few moment and then nodded in the direction of the door
usha poor joe_dillon said mr connor throwing the end of his cigarette into the fire he hard up like the rest of us
tell me he said across the fire what brings our friend in here what does he want mr_henchy snuffled vigorously and spat so copiously that he nearly put out the fire which uttered a hissing protest
to tell you my private and candid opinion he said i think he a man from the other camp he a spy of colgan if you ask me
just go round and try and find out how they re getting on they wont suspect you do you twig ah poor joe_dillon is a decent skin said mr connor
his father was a decent respectable man mr_henchy admitted poor old larry mr_hynes many a good turn he did in his day
but i greatly afraid our friend is not nineteen carat damn it i can understand a fellow being hard up but what i cant understand is a fellow sponging
couldnt he have some spark of manhood about him he doesnt get a warm welcome from me when he comes said the old man
let him work for his own side and not come spying around here i dont know said mr connor dubiously as he took out cigarette paper and tobacco
i think joe_dillon mr_hynes is a straight man he a clever chap too with the pen do you remember that thing he wrote
some of these hillsiders and fenians are a bit too clever if you ask me said mr_henchy do you know what my private and candid opinion is about some of those little jokers
i believe half of them are in the pay of the castle there no knowing said the old man
but i know it for a fact said mr_henchy they re castle hacks i dont say mr_hynes no damn it
i think he a stroke above that but there a certain little nobleman with a cock eye you know the patriot i alluding to
mr connor nodded there a lineal descendant of major sirr for you if you like the heart blood of a patriot
that sell his country for fourpence ay and go down on his bended knees and thank the almighty christ he had a country to sell
that a fellow now there was a knock at the door come in said mr_henchy a person resembling a poor clergyman or a poor actor appeared in the doorway
his black clothes were tightly buttoned on his short body and it was impossible to say whether he wore a clergyman collar or a layman because the collar of his shabby frock coat the uncovered buttons of which reflected the candlelight was turned up about his neck
he wore a round hat of hard black felt his face shining with raindrops had the appearance of damp yellow cheese save where two rosy spots indicated the cheekbones
he opened his very long mouth suddenly to express disappointment and at the same time opened wide his very bright blue eye to express pleasure and surprise
father keon said mr_henchy jumping up from his chair is that you come in no no no
said father keon quickly pursing his lip as if he were addressing a child wont you come in and sit down
no no no said father keon speaking in a discreet indulgent velvety voice dont let me disturb you now i just looking for mr fanning
he round at the black eagle said mr_henchy but wont you come in and sit down a minute
he retreated from the doorway and mr_henchy seizing one of the candlesticks went to the door to light him downstairs
no no thank you it was just a little business matter said father keon thank you indeed dont trouble i beg
no but the stair is so dark no no i can see thank you indeed are you right now
all right thanks thanks mr_henchy returned with the candlestick and put it on the table he sat down again at the fire
there was silence for a few moment tell me john said mr connor lighting his cigarette with another pasteboard card hm
what he is exactly ask me an easier one said mr_henchy fanning and himself seem to me very thick
they re often in kavanagh together is he a priest at all mmmyes i believe so i think he what you call a black sheep
we havent many of them thank god but we have a few he an unfortunate man of some kind and how does he knock it out asked mr connor
that another mystery is he attached to any chapel or church or institution or no said mr_henchy i think he travelling on his own account
god forgive me he added i thought he was the dozen of stout is there any chance of a drink itself asked mr connor
i dry too said the old man i asked that little shoeboy three time said mr_henchy would he send up a dozen of stout
i asked him again now but he was leaning on the counter in his shirt sleeves having a deep goster with alderman cowley
why didnt you remind him said mr connor well i couldnt go over while he was talking to alderman cowley
i just waited till i caught his eye and said about that little matter i was speaking to you about
that ll be all right mr he said yerra sure the little hop my thumb has forgotten all about it there some deal on in that quarter said mr connor thoughtfully
i saw the three of them hard at it yesterday at suffolk street corner i think i know the little game they re at said mr_henchy
you must owe the city father money nowadays if you want to be made lord mayor then they ll make you lord mayor
by god i thinking seriously of becoming a city father myself what do you think would i do for the job
driving out of the mansion house said mr_henchy in all my vermin with jack_mooney here standing up behind me in a powdered wig eh
mr connor laughed so far as owing money goes and make me your private secretary john yes and i ll make father keon my private chaplain
we ll have a family party faith mr_henchy said the old man you keep up better style than some of them
i was talking one day to old keegan the porter and how do you like your new master pat says i to him
you havent much entertaining now says i entertaining says he he live on the smell of an oil rag and do you know what he told me
he told me what do you think of a lord mayor of dublin sending out for a pound of chops for his dinner
now i declare to god i didnt believe him what said mr_henchy and mr connor how that for high living says he
wisha wisha says i a pound of chops says he coming into the mansion house wisha says i what kind of people is going at all now
at this point there was a knock at the door and a boy put in his head what is it said the old man
from the black eagle said the boy walking in sideways and depositing a basket on the floor with a noise of shaken bottle
the old man helped the boy to transfer the bottle from the basket to the table and counted the full tally
after the transfer the boy put his basket on his arm and asked any bottle what bottle said the old man
wont you let us drink them first said mr_henchy i was told to ask for the bottle come back tomorrow said the old man
here boy said mr_henchy will you run over to farrell and ask him to lend us a corkscrew for mr_henchy say
the boy went out and mr_henchy began to rub his hand cheerfully saying ah well he not so bad after all
tell him we wont keep it a minute leave the basket there he as good as his word anyhow
there no tumblers said the old man dont let that trouble you jack_mooney said mr_henchy many the good man before now drank out of the bottle
anyway it better than nothing said mr connor he not a bad sort said mr_henchy only fanning has such a loan of him
the old man opened three bottle and was handing back the corkscrew when mr_henchy said to the boy would you like a drink boy
he means well you know in his own tinpot way the boy came back with the corkscrew if you please sir said the boy
the old man opened another bottle grudgingly and handed it to the boy what age are you he asked
as the old man said nothing further the boy took the bottle and said here my best respects sir to mr_henchy drank the contents put the bottle back on the table and wiped his mouth with his sleeve
seventeen said the boy then he took up the corkscrew and went out of the door sideways muttering some form of salutation
that the way it begins said the old man the thin edge of the wedge said mr_henchy the old man distributed the three bottle which he had opened and the man drank from them simultaneously
after having drunk each placed his bottle on the mantelpiece within hand reach and drew in a long breath of satisfaction
well i did a good day work today said mr_henchy after a pause that so john yes
i got him one or two sure thing in dawson street mr_crofton and myself between ourselves you know mr_crofton he a decent chap of course but he not worth a damn as a canvasser
he hasnt a word to throw to a dog he stands and looks at the people while i do the talking
one of them was a very fat man whose blue serge clothes seemed to be in danger of falling from his sloping figure
here two man entered the room he had a big face which resembled a young ox face in expression staring blue eye and a grizzled moustache
the other man who was much younger and frailer had a thin clean shaven face he wore a very high double collar and a wide brimmed bowler hat
hello mr_crofton said mr_henchy to the fat man talk of the devil where did the boose come from
asked the young man did the cow calve of course mr_lyons spots the drink first thing said mr connor laughing
is that the way you chap canvass said mr_lyons and mr_crofton and i out in the cold and rain looking for votes
why blast your soul said mr_henchy i get more votes in five minute than you two get in a week
open two bottle of stout jack_mooney said mr connor how can i said the old man when there no corkscrew
wait now wait now said mr_henchy getting up quickly did you ever see this little trick he took two bottle from the table and carrying them to the fire put them on the hob
mr_lyons sat on the edge of the table pushed his hat towards the nape of his neck and began to swing his legs
then he sat down again by the fire and took another drink from his bottle which is my bottle
he asked this lad said mr_henchy mr_crofton sat down on a box and looked fixedly at the other bottle on the hob
the first reason sufficient in itself was that he had nothing to say the second reason was that he considered his companions beneath him
he had been a canvasser for wilkins the conservative but when the conservatives had withdrawn their man and choosing the lesser of two evils given their support to the nationalist candidate he had been engaged to work for mr tiemey
he was silent for two reasons in a few minute an apologetic pok was heard as the cork flew out of mr_lyons bottle
mr_lyons jumped off the table went to the fire took his bottle and carried it back to the table
i was just telling them mr_crofton said mr_henchy that we got a good few votes today who did you get asked mr_lyons
well i got parkes for one and i got atkinson for two and got ward of dawson street fine old chap he is too regular old toff old conservative
but isnt your candidate a nationalist said he he a respectable man said i he in favour of whatever will benefit this country
he has extensive house property in the city and three place of business and isnt it to his own advantage to keep down the rates
he a prominent and respected citizen said i and a poor law guardian and he doesnt belong to any party good bad or indifferent
he a big ratepayer i said that the way to talk to em and what about the address to the king said mr_lyons after drinking and smacking his lip
listen to me said mr_henchy what we want in this country as i said to old ward is capital
the king coming here will mean an influx of money into this country the citizens of dublin will benefit by it
look at all the money there is in the country if we only worked the old industries the mills the ship building yards and factories
look at all the factories down by the quays there idle it capital we want but look here john said mr connor
why should we welcome the king of england didnt parnell himself parnell said mr_henchy is dead now here the way i look at it
here this chap come to the throne after his old mother keeping him out of it till the man was grey
he a man of the world and he means well by us he a jolly fine decent fellow if you ask me and no damn nonsense about him
he just says to himself the old one never went to see these wild irish by christ i ll go myself and see what they re like
and are we going to insult the man when he comes over here on a friendly visit eh isnt that right mr_crofton
mr_crofton nodded his head but after all now said mr_lyons argumentatively king edward life you know is not the very
let bygones be bygones said mr_henchy i admire the man personally he just an ordinary knockabout like you and me
he fond of his glass of grog and he a bit of a rake perhaps and he a good sportsman damn it cant we irish play fair
that all very fine said mr_lyons but look at the case of parnell now in the name of god said mr_henchy where the analogy between the two case
what i mean said mr_lyons is we have our ideals why now would we welcome a man like that
do you think now after what he did parnell was a fit man to lead us and why then would we do it for edward the seventh
this is parnell anniversary said mr connor and dont let us stir up any bad blood we all respect him now that he dead and gone even the conservatives he added turning to mr_crofton
pok the tardy cork flew out of mr_crofton bottle mr_crofton got up from his box and went to the fire
as he returned with his capture he said in a deep voice our side of the house respects him because he was a gentleman
right you are mr_crofton said mr_henchy fiercely he was the only man that could keep that bag of cats in order
down ye dogs lie down ye curs that the way he treated them come in joe_dillon come in he called out catching sight of mr_hynes in the doorway
mr_hynes came in slowly open another bottle of stout jack_mooney said mr_henchy i forgot there no corkscrew
here show me one here and i ll put it at the fire the old man handed him another bottle and he placed it on the hob
sit down joe_dillon said mr connor we re just talking about the chief ay ay said mr_henchy mr_hynes sat on the side of the table near mr_lyons but said nothing
there one of them anyhow said mr_henchy that didnt renege him by god i ll say for you joe_dillon no by god you stuck to him like a man
joe_dillon said mr connor suddenly give us that thing you wrote do you remember have you got it on you ay said mr_henchy
give us that did you ever hear that mr_crofton listen to this now splendid thing go on said mr connor
mr_hynes did not seem to remember at once the piece to which they were alluding but after reflecting a while he said that thing is it
fire away joe_dillon sure that old now out with it man said mr connor sh sh said mr_henchy
now joe_dillon mr_hynes hesitated a little longer then amid the silence he took off his hat laid it on the table and stood up
he seemed to be rehearsing the piece in his mind after a rather long pause he announced the death of parnell th october
he cleared his throat once or twice and then began to recite he is dead our uncrowned king is dead erin mourn with grief and woe
he lies slain by the coward hounds he raised to glory from the mire and erin hopes and erin dreams perish upon her monarch pyre
for he lies dead whom the fell gang of modern hypocrites laid low in palace cabin or in cot the irish heart
he would have had his erin famed the green flag gloriously unfurled her statesmen bards and warriors raised before the nations of the world
where er it be is bowed with woe for he is gone who would have wrought her destiny he dreamed alas twas but a dream
shame on the coward caitiff hand that smote their lord or with a kiss betrayed him to the rabble rout of fawning priest no friend of his
of liberty but as he strove to clutch that idol treachery sundered him from the thing he loved may everlasting shame consume
the memory of those who tried to befoul and smear the exalted name of one who spurned them in his pride
he fell as fall the mighty one nobly undaunted to the last and death has now united him with erin heroes of the past
no sound of strife disturb his sleep calmly he rests no human pain or high ambition spurs him now the peaks of glory to attain
but erin list his spirit may rise like the phoenix from the flames when breaks the dawning of the day the day that brings us freedom reign
they had their way they laid him low and on that day may erin well pledge in the cup she lifts to joy one grief the memory of parnell
mr_hynes sat down again on the table when he had finished his recitation there was a silence and then a burst of clapping even mr_lyons clapped
the applause continued for a little time when it had ceased all the auditors drank from their bottle in silence pok
the cork flew out of mr_hynes bottle but mr_hynes remained sitting flushed and bare headed on the table he did not seem to have heard the invitation
good man joe_dillon said mr connor taking out his cigarette paper and pouch the better to hide his emotion
what do you think of that mr_crofton cried mr_henchy isnt that fine what mr_crofton said that it was a very fine piece of writing
a mother mr_holohan assistant secretary of the eire abu society had been walking up and down dublin for nearly a month with his hand and pocket full of dirty piece of paper arranging about the series of concert
he walked up and down constantly stood by the hour at street corner arguing the point and made note but in the end it was mrs_kearney who arranged everything
he had a game leg and for this his friend called him hoppy mr_holohan miss devlin had become mrs_kearney out of spite
she had been educated in a high class convent where she had learned french and music as she was naturally pale and unbending in manner she made few friend at school
when she came to the age of marriage she was sent out to many house where her playing and ivory manner were much admired
she sat amid the chilly circle of her accomplishments waiting for some suitor to brave it and offer her a brilliant life
but the young man whom she met were ordinary and she gave them no encouragement trying to console her romantic desires by eating a great deal of turkish delight in secret
however when she drew near the limit and her friend began to loosen their tongue about her she silenced them by marrying mr kearney who was a bootmaker on ormond quay
after the first year of married life mrs_kearney perceived that such a man would wear better than a romantic person but she never put her own romantic idea away
he was much older than she his conversation which was serious took place at intervals in his great brown beard he was sober thrifty and pious he went to the altar every first friday sometimes with her oftener by himself
at some party in a strange house when she lifted her eyebrow ever so slightly he stood up to take his leave and
but she never weakened in her religion and was a good wife to him when his cough troubled him she put the eider down quilt over his foot and made a strong rum punch
by paying a small sum every week into a society he ensured for both his daughter a dowry of one hundred pounds each when they came to the age of twenty four
he sent the older daughter miss_kathleen_kearney to a good convent where she learned french and music and afterward paid her fees at the academy
every year in the month of july mrs_kearney found occasion to say to some friend my good man is packing us off to skerries for a few week
when the irish revival began to be appreciable mrs_kearney determined to take advantage of her daughter name and brought an irish teacher to the house
for his part he was a model father if it was not skerries it was howth or greystones miss_kathleen_kearney and her sister sent irish picture postcards to their friend and these friend sent back other irish picture postcards
on special sundays when mr kearney went with his family to the pro cathedral a little crowd of people would assemble after mass at the corner of cathedral street
they were all friend of the kearneys musical friend or nationalist friend and when they had played every little counter of gossip they shook hand with one another all together laughing at the crossing of so many hand and said good bye to one another in irish
people said that she was very clever at music and a very nice girl and moreover that she was a believer in the language movement
soon the name of miss_kathleen_kearney began to be heard often on people lip mrs_kearney was well content at this
therefore she was not surprised when one day mr_holohan came to her and proposed that her daughter should be the accompanist at a series of four grand concert which his society was going to give in the antient concert room
she entered heart and soul into the details of the enterprise advised and dissuaded and finally a contract was drawn up by which miss_kathleen_kearney was to receive eight guineas for her services as accompanist at the four grand concert
as mr_holohan was a novice in such delicate matter as the wording of bills and the disposing of items for a programme mrs_kearney helped him
she brought him into the drawing room made him sit down and brought out the decanter and the silver biscuit barrel she had tact
she knew what artiste should go into capitals and what artiste should go into small type she knew that the first tenor would not like to come on after mr meade comic turn
to keep the audience continually diverted she slipped the doubtful items in between the old favourites mr_holohan called to see her every day to have her advice on some point
she was invariably friendly and advising homely in fact she pushed the decanter towards him saying now help yourself mr_holohan and while he was helping himself she said dont be afraid
dont be afraid of it everything went on smoothly mrs_kearney bought some lovely blush pink charmeuse in brown thomas to let into the front of miss_kathleen_kearney dress
she took a dozen of two shilling tickets for the final concert and sent them to those friend who could not be trusted to come otherwise
it cost a pretty penny but there are occasions when a little expense is justifiable she forgot nothing and thanks to her everything that was to be done was done
when mrs_kearney arrived with her daughter at the antient concert room on wednesday night she did not like the look of thing
a few young man wearing bright blue badges in their coats stood idle in the vestibule none of them wore evening dress
she passed by with her daughter and a quick glance through the open door of the hall showed her the cause of the stewards idleness
the concert were to be on wednesday thursday friday and saturday at first she wondered had she mistaken the hour no it was twenty minute to eight
in the dressing room behind the stage she was introduced to the secretary of the society mr_fitzpatrick she smiled and shook his hand
she noticed that he wore his soft brown hat carelessly on the side of his head and that his accent was flat
he held a programme in his hand and while he was talking to her he chewed one end of it into a moist pulp
he was a little man with a white vacant face he seemed to bear disappointments lightly mr_holohan came into the dressingroom every few minute with reports from the box office
the artiste talked among themselves nervously glanced from time to time at the mirror and rolled and unrolled their music when it was nearly half past eight the few people in the hall began to express their desire to be entertained
mr_fitzpatrick came in smiled vacantly at the room and said well now lady and gentleman i suppose we better open the ball
mrs_kearney rewarded his very flat final syllable with a quick stare of contempt and then said to her daughter encouragingly are you ready dear
when she had an opportunity she called mr_holohan aside and asked him to tell her what it meant
mr_holohan did not know what it meant he said that the committee had made a mistake in arranging for four concert four was too many
and the artiste said mrs_kearney of course they are doing their best but really they are not good
mr_holohan admitted that the artiste were no good but the committee he said had decided to let the first three concert go as they pleased and reserve all the talent for saturday night
mrs_kearney said nothing but as the mediocre items followed one another on the platform and the few people in the hall grew fewer and fewer she began to regret that she had put herself to any expense for such a concert
there was something she didnt like in the look of thing and mr_fitzpatrick vacant smile irritated her very much
however she said nothing and waited to see how it would end the concert expired shortly before ten and everyone went home quickly
the concert on thursday night was better attended but mrs_kearney saw at once that the house was filled with paper
the audience behaved indecorously as if the concert were an informal dress rehearsal mr_fitzpatrick seemed to enjoy himself he was quite unconscious that mrs_kearney was taking angry note of his conduct
he stood at the edge of the screen from time to time jutting out his head and exchanging a laugh with two friend in the corner of the balcony
in the course of the evening mrs_kearney learned that the friday concert was to be abandoned and that the committee was going to move heaven and earth to secure a bumper house on saturday night
she buttonholed him as he was limping out quickly with a glass of lemonade for a young lady and asked him was it true
when she heard this she sought out mr_holohan yes it was true but of course that doesnt alter the contract she said
the contract was for four concert mr_holohan seemed to be in a hurry he advised her to speak to mr_fitzpatrick
she called mr_fitzpatrick away from his screen and told him that her daughter had signed for four concert and that of course according to the terms of the contract she should receive the sum originally stipulated for whether the society gave the four concert or not
mr_fitzpatrick who did not catch the point at issue very quickly seemed unable to resolve the difficulty and said that he would bring the matter before the committee
mrs_kearney anger began to flutter in her cheek and she had all she could do to keep from asking and who is the cometty pray
mrs_kearney was now beginning to be alarmed but she knew that it would not be ladylike to do that so she was silent
special puffs appeared in all the evening paper reminding the music loving public of the treat which was in store for it on the following evening
little boy were sent out into the principal street of dublin early on friday morning with bundles of handbills mrs_kearney was somewhat reassured but she thought well to tell her husband part of her suspicions
he listened carefully and said that perhaps it would be better if he went with her on saturday night she agreed
she respected her husband in the same way as she respected the general post office as something large secure and fixed and though she knew the small number of his talents she appreciated his abstract value as a male
she was glad that he had suggested coming with her she thought her plans over the night of the grand concert came
mrs_kearney with her husband and daughter arrived at the antient concert room three quarters of an hour before the time at which the concert was to begin
mrs_kearney placed her daughter clothes and music in charge of her husband and went all over the building looking for mr_holohan or mr_fitzpatrick
she asked the stewards was any member of the committee in the hall and after a great deal of trouble a steward brought out a little woman named miss beirne to whom mrs_kearney explained that she wanted to see one of the secretaries
by ill luck it was a rainy evening she could find neither miss beirne expected them any minute and asked could she do anything
mrs_kearney looked searchingly at the oldish face which was screwed into an expression of trustfulness and enthusiasm and answered no thank you
she looked out at the rain until the melancholy of the wet street effaced all the trustfulness and enthusiasm from her twisted features
the little woman hoped they would have a good house then she gave a little sigh and said ah well we did our best the dear knows
mrs_kearney had to go back to the dressing room the artiste were arriving the bass and the second tenor had already come
he was the son of a hall porter in an office in the city and as a boy he had sung prolonged bass note in the resounding hall
the bass mr duggan was a slender young man with a scattered black moustache from this humble state he had raised himself until he had become a first rate artiste
one night when an operatic artiste had fallen ill he had undertaken the part of the king in the opera of maritana at the queen theatre
he sang his music with great feeling and volume and was warmly welcomed by the gallery but unfortunately he marred the good impression by wiping his nose in his gloved hand once or twice out of thoughtlessness
he said yous so softly that it passed unnoticed and he never drank anything stronger than milk for his voice sake
he had appeared in grand opera he was unassuming and spoke little mr bell the second tenor was a fair haired little man who competed every year for prizes at the feis ceoil
on his fourth trial he had been awarded a bronze medal he was extremely nervous and extremely jealous of other tenor and he covered his nervous jealousy with an ebullient friendliness
it was his humour to have people know what an ordeal a concert was to him therefore when he saw mr duggan he went over to him and asked are you in it too
yes said mr duggan mr bell laughed at his fellow sufferer held out his hand and said shake mrs_kearney passed by these two young man and went to the edge of the screen to view the house
the seats were being filled up rapidly and a pleasant noise circulated in the auditorium she came back and spoke to her husband privately
their conversation was evidently about miss_kathleen_kearney for they both glanced at her often as she stood chatting to one of her nationalist friend miss_healy the contralto
an unknown solitary woman with a pale face walked through the room the woman followed with keen eye the faded blue dress which was stretched upon a meagre body
someone said that she was madam glynn the soprano i wonder where did they dig her up said miss_kathleen_kearney to miss_healy
mr_holohan limped into the dressing room at that moment and the two young lady asked him who was the unknown woman
i sure i never heard of her miss_healy had to smile mr_holohan said that she was madam glynn from london
madam glynn took her stand in a corner of the room holding a roll of music stiffly before her and from time to time changing the direction of her startled gaze
the shadow took her faded dress into shelter but fell revengefully into the little cup behind her collar bone the noise of the hall became more audible
the first tenor and the baritone arrived together they were both well dressed stout and complacent and they brought a breath of opulence among the company
she wanted to be on good terms with them but while she strove to be polite her eye followed mr_holohan in his limping and devious course
mrs_kearney brought her daughter over to them and talked to them amiably as soon as she could she excused herself and went out after him
mr_holohan i want to speak to you for a moment she said they went down to a discreet part of the corridor
mrs_kearney asked him when was her daughter going to be paid mr_holohan said that mr_fitzpatrick had charge of that
mrs_kearney said that she didnt know anything about mr_fitzpatrick her daughter had signed a contract for eight guineas and she would have to be paid
mr_holohan said that it wasnt his business why isnt it your business asked mrs_kearney didnt you yourself bring her the contract
anyway if it not your business it my business and i mean to see to it you better speak to mr_fitzpatrick said mr_holohan distantly
i dont know anything about mr_fitzpatrick repeated mrs_kearney i have my contract and i intend to see that it is carried out
two man in outdoor dress had taken possession of the fireplace and were chatting familiarly with miss_healy and the baritone
when she came back to the dressing room her cheeks were slightly suffused the room was lively they were the freeman man and mr madden tom_burke
the freeman man had come in to say that he could not wait for the concert as he had to report the lecture which an american priest was giving in the mansion house
he said they were to leave the report for him at the freeman office and he would see that it went in
he was a grey haired man with a plausible voice and careful manner he held an extinguished cigar in his hand and the aroma of cigar smoke floated near him
he had not intended to stay a moment because concert and artiste bored him considerably but he remained leaning against the mantelpiece
he was old enough to suspect one reason for her politeness but young enough in spirit to turn the moment to account
miss_healy stood in front of him talking and laughing the warmth fragrance and colour of her body appealed to his senses
he was pleasantly conscious that the bosom which he saw rise and fall slowly beneath him rose and fell at that moment for him that the laughter and fragrance and wilful glances were his tribute
when he could stay no longer he took leave of her regretfully madden tom_burke will write the notice he explained to mr_holohan and i ll see it in
thank you very much mr hendrick said mr_holohan you ll see it in i know now wont you have a little something before you go
the two man went along some tortuous passages and up a dark staircase and came to a secluded room where one of the stewards was uncorking bottle for a few gentleman
i dont mind said mr hendrick one of these gentleman was mr madden tom_burke who had found out the room by instinct
he was a suave elderly man who balanced his imposing body when at rest upon a large silk umbrella his magniloquent western name was the moral umbrella upon which he balanced the fine problem of his finances
while mr_holohan was entertaining the freeman man mrs_kearney was speaking so animatedly to her husband that he had to ask her to lower her voice
he was widely respected the conversation of the other in the dressing room had become strained mr bell the first item stood ready with his music but the accompanist made no sign
evidently something was wrong mr kearney looked straight before him stroking his beard while mrs_kearney spoke into miss_kathleen_kearney ear with subdued emphasis
the first tenor and the baritone and miss_healy stood together waiting tranquilly but mr bell nerves were greatly agitated because he was afraid the audience would think that he had come late
from the hall came sounds of encouragement clapping and stamping of foot mr_holohan and mr madden tom_burke came into the room
in a moment mr_holohan perceived the hush he went over to mrs_kearney and spoke with her earnestly while they were speaking the noise in the hall grew louder
mr_holohan became very red and excited he spoke volubly but mrs_kearney said curtly at intervals she wont go on
she must get her eight guineas mr_holohan pointed desperately towards the hall where the audience was clapping and stamping
he appealed to mr kearney and to miss_kathleen_kearney but mr kearney continued to stroke his beard and miss_kathleen_kearney looked down moving the point of her new shoe
it was not her fault mrs_kearney repeated she wont go on without her money after a swift struggle of tongue mr_holohan hobbled out in haste
when the strain of the silence had become somewhat painful miss_healy said to the baritone have you seen mrs pat campbell this week
the room was silent the baritone had not seen her but he had been told that she was very fine
the first tenor bent his head and began to count the links of the gold chain which was extended across his waist smiling and humming random note to observe the effect on the frontal sinus
the noise in the auditorium had risen to a clamour when mr_fitzpatrick burst into the room followed by mr_holohan who was panting
the conversation went no further from time to time everyone glanced at mrs_kearney the clapping and stamping in the hall were punctuated by whistling
mr_fitzpatrick held a few banknotes in his hand he counted out four into mrs_kearney hand and said she would get the other half at the interval
but miss_kathleen_kearney gathered in her skirt and said now mr bell to the first item who was shaking like an aspen
mrs_kearney said this is four shillings short the singer and the accompanist went out together the noise in hall died away
there was a pause of a few seconds and then the piano was heard the first part of the concert was very successful except for madam glynn item
the poor lady sang killarney in a bodiless gasping voice with all the old fashioned mannerisms of intonation and pronunciation which she believed lent elegance to her singing
she looked as if she had been resurrected from an old stage wardrobe and the cheaper part of the hall made fun of her high wailing note
the first tenor and the contralto however brought down the house miss_kathleen_kearney played a selection of irish air which was generously applauded
the first part closed with a stirring patriotic recitation delivered by a young lady who arranged amateur theatricals it was deservedly applauded and when it was ended the man went out for the interval content
in one corner were mr_holohan mr_fitzpatrick miss beirne two of the stewards the baritone the bass and mr madden tom_burke
all this time the dressing room was a hive of excitement mr madden tom_burke said it was the most scandalous exhibition he had ever witnessed
miss_kathleen_kearney musical career was ended in dublin after that he said the baritone was asked what did he think of mrs_kearney conduct
he did not like to say anything he had been paid his money and wished to be at peace with man
however he said that mrs_kearney might have taken the artiste into consideration the stewards and the secretaries debated hotly as to what should be done when the interval came
in another corner of the room were mrs_kearney and her husband mr bell miss_healy and the young lady who had to recite the patriotic piece
i agree with miss beirne said mr madden tom_burke pay her nothing mrs_kearney said that the committee had treated her scandalously
she had spared neither trouble nor expense and this was how she was repaid they thought they had only a girl to deal with and that therefore they could ride roughshod over her
but she would show them their mistake they wouldnt have dared to have treated her like that if she had been a man
but she would see that her daughter got her rights she wouldnt be fooled if they didnt pay her to the last farthing she would make dublin ring
of course she was sorry for the sake of the artiste but what else could she do she appealed to the second tenor who said he thought she had not been well treated
then she appealed to miss_healy miss healy wanted to join the other group but she did not like to do so because she was a great friend of miss_kathleen_kearney and the kearneys
as soon as the first part was ended mr_fitzpatrick and mr_holohan went over to mrs_kearney and told her that the other four guineas would be paid after the committee meeting on the following tuesday and that in case her daughter did not play for the second part the committee would consider the contract broken and would pay nothing
had often invited her to their house i havent seen any committee said mrs_kearney angrily my daughter has her contract
she will get four pounds eight into her hand or a foot she wont put on that platform i surprised at you mrs_kearney said mr_holohan
i never thought you would treat us this way and what way did you treat me asked mrs_kearney
her face was inundated with an angry colour and she looked as if she would attack someone with her hand
i asking for my rights she said you might have some sense of decency said mr_holohan might i indeed
and when i ask when my daughter is going to be paid i cant get a civil answer she tossed her head and assumed a haughty voice you must speak to the secretary
it not my business i a great fellow fol the diddle i do i thought you were a lady said mr_holohan walking away from her abruptly
after that mrs_kearney conduct was condemned on all hand everyone approved of what the committee had done she stood at the door haggard with rage arguing with her husband and daughter gesticulating with them
she waited until it was time for the second part to begin in the hope that the secretaries would approach her
but miss_healy had kindly consented to play one or two accompaniments mrs_kearney had to stand aside to allow the baritone and his accompanist to pass up to the platform
she stood still for an instant like an angry stone image and when the first note of the song struck her ear she caught up her daughter cloak and said to her husband get a cab
he went out at once mrs_kearney wrapped the cloak round her daughter and followed him as she passed through the doorway she stopped and glared into mr_holohan face
i not done with you yet she said but i done with you said mr_holohan miss_kathleen_kearney followed her mother meekly
mr_holohan began to pace up and down the room in order to cool himself for he his skin on fire
that a nice lady he said she a nice lady you did the proper thing mr_holohan said mr madden tom_burke poised upon his umbrella in approval
grace two gentleman who were in the lavatory at the time tried to lift him up but he was quite helpless
he lay curled up at the foot of the stair down which he had fallen they succeeded in turning him over
his hat had rolled a few yards away and his clothes were smeared with the filth and ooze of the floor on which he had lain face downwards
his eye were closed and he breathed with a grunting noise a thin stream of blood trickled from the corner of his mouth
these two gentleman and one of the curates carried him up the stair and laid him down again on the floor of the bar
in two minute he was surrounded by a ring of man the manager of the bar asked everyone who he was and who was with him
no one knew who he was but one of the curates said he had served the gentleman with a small rum
was he by himself asked the manager no sir there was two gentleman with him and where are they
no one knew a voice said give him air he fainted the ring of onlookers distended and closed again elastically
a dark medal of blood had formed itself near the man head on the tessellated floor the manager alarmed by the grey pallor of the man face sent for a policeman
his collar was unfastened and his necktie undone he opened eye for an instant sighed and closed them again one of gentleman who had carried him upstairs held a dinged silk hat in his hand
the manager asked repeatedly did no one know who the injured man was or where had his friend gone the door of the bar opened and an immense constable entered
a crowd which had followed him down the laneway collected outside the door struggling to look in through the glass panels
he moved his head slowly to right and left and from the manager to the person on the floor as if he feared to be the victim of some delusion
then he drew off his glove produced a small book from his waist licked the lead of his pencil and made ready to indite
the manager at once began to narrate what he knew the constable a young man with thick immobile features listened he asked in a suspicious provincial accent who is the man
what his name and address a young man in a cycling suit cleared his way through the ring of bystanders he knelt down promptly beside the injured man and called for water
the constable knelt down also to help the young man washed the blood from the injured man mouth and then called for some brandy
the constable repeated the order in an authoritative voice until a curate came running with the glass the brandy was forced down the man throat
in a few seconds he opened his eye and looked about him he looked at the circle of face and then understanding strove to rise to his foot
you re all right now asked the young man in the cycling suit sha nothing said the injured man trying to stand up
he was helped to his foot the manager said something about a hospital and some of the bystanders gave advice the battered silk hat was placed on the man head
the constable asked where do you live the man without answering began to twirl the end of his moustache he made light of his accident
it was nothing he said only a little accident he spoke very thickly where do you live repeated the constable
while the point was being debated a tall agile gentleman of fair complexion wearing a long yellow ulster came from the far end of the bar
the man said they were to get a cab for him seeing the spectacle he called out hallo tom_burke old man
what the trouble sha nothing said the man the new comer surveyed the deplorable figure before him and then turned to the constable saying it all right constable
i ll see him home the constable touched his helmet and answered all right mr_power come now tom_burke said mr_power taking his friend by the arm
no bones broken what can you walk the young man in the cycling suit took the man by the other arm and the crowd divided
how did you get yourself into this mess asked mr_power the gentleman fell down the stair said the young man
i ery uch liged to you sir said the injured man not at all ant we have a little
not now not now the three man left the bar and the crowd sifted through the door in to the laneway
the manager brought the constable to the stair to inspect the scene of the accident they agreed that the gentleman must have missed his footing
the customers returned to the counter and a curate set about removing the traces of blood from the floor when they came out into grafton street mr_power whistled for an outsider
the injured man said again as well as he could i ery uch liged to you sir i hope we ll eet again
y na is mr_kernan the shock and the incipient pain had partly sobered him dont mention it said the young man
mr_kernan was hoisted on to the car and while mr_power was giving directions to the carman he expressed his gratitude to the young man and regretted that they could not have a little drink together
they shook hand another time said the young man the car drove off towards westmoreland street as it passed ballast office the clock showed half past nine
a keen east wind hit them blowing from the mouth of the river mr_kernan was huddled together with cold his friend asked him to tell how the accident had happened
i ant an he answered ongue is hurt show the other leaned over the well of the car and peered into mr_kernan mouth but he could not see
he struck a match and sheltering it in the shell of his hand peered again into the mouth which mr_kernan opened obediently
the lower teeth and gums were covered with clotted blood and a minute piece of the tongue seemed to have been bitten off
the swaying movement of the car brought the match to and from the opened mouth the match was blown out
that ugly said mr_power sha nothing said mr_kernan closing his mouth and pulling the collar of his filthy coat across his neck
mr_kernan was a commercial traveller of the old school which believed in the dignity of its calling he had never been seen in the city without a silk hat of some decency and a pair of gaiters
he carried on the tradition of his napoleon the great blackwhite whose memory he evoked at time by legend and mimicry
modern business methods had spared him only so far as to allow him a little office in crowe street on the window blind of which was written the name of his firm with the address london c
on the mantelpiece of this little office a little leaden battalion of canisters was drawn up and on the table before the window stood four or five china bowls which were usually half full of a black liquid
by grace of these two articles of clothing he said a man could always pass muster from these bowls mr_kernan tasted tea
he took a mouthful drew it up saturated his palate with it and then spat it forth into the grate then he paused to judge
the arc of his social rise intersected the arc of his friend decline but mr_kernan decline was mitigated by the fact that certain of those friend who had known him at his highest point of success still esteemed him as a character
mr_power a much younger man was employed in the royal irish constabulary office in dublin castle mr_power was one of these friend
his inexplicable debts were a byword in his circle he was a debonair young man the car halted before a small house on the glasnevin road and mr_kernan was helped into the house
his wife put him to bed while mr_power sat downstairs in the kitchen asking the child where they went to school and what book they were in
the child two girl and a boy conscious of their father helplessness and of their mother absence began some horseplay with him
he was surprised at their manner and at their accents and his brow grew thoughtful after a while mrs mr_kernan entered the kitchen exclaiming such a sight
mr_power was careful to explain to her that he was not responsible that he had come on the scene by the merest accident
mrs mr_kernan remembering mr_power good office during domestic quarrels as well as many small but opportune loans said you neednt tell me that mr_power
o he ll do for himself one day and that the holy alls of it he been drinking since friday i know you re a friend of his not like some of the other he does be with
they re all right so long as he has money in his pocket to keep him out from his wife and family
nice friend who was he with tonight i like to know mr_power shook his head but said nothing
i so sorry she continued that i ve nothing in the house to offer you but if you wait a minute i ll send round to mr_fogarty at the corner
mr_power stood up we were waiting for him to come home with the money he never seems to think he has a home at all
now mrs mr_kernan said mr_power we ll make him turn over a new leaf i ll talk to martin he the man
we ll come here one of these night and talk it over she saw him to the door the carman was stamping up and down the footpath and swinging his arm to warm himself
it very kind of you to bring him home she said not at all said mr_power he got up on the car
as it drove off he raised his hat to her gaily we ll make a new man of him he said
good night mrs mr_kernan mrs mr_kernan puzzled eye watched the car till it was out of sight
then she withdrew them went into the house and emptied her husband pocket she was an active practical woman of middle age
not long before she had celebrated her silver wedding and renewed her intimacy with her husband by waltzing with him to mr_power accompaniment
in her day of courtship mr_kernan had seemed to her a not ungallant figure and she still hurried to the chapel door whenever a wedding was reported and seeing the bridal pair recalled with vivid pleasure how she had passed out of the star of the sea church in sandymount leaning on the arm of a jovial well fed man who was dressed smartly in a frock coat and lavender trousers and carried a silk hat gracefully balanced upon his other arm
after three week she had found a wife life irksome and later on when she was beginning to find it unbearable she had become a mother
the part of mother presented to her no insuperable difficulties and for twenty five year she had kept house shrewdly for her husband
her two eldest son were launched one was in a draper shop in glasgow and the other was clerk to a tea merchant in belfast
they were good son wrote regularly and sometimes sent home money the other child were still at school mr_kernan sent a letter to his office next day and remained in bed
she accepted his frequent intemperance as part of the climate healed him dutifully whenever he was sick and always tried to make him eat a breakfast
he had never been violent since the boy had grown up and she knew that he would walk to the end of thomas street and back again to book even a small order
she made beef tea for him and scolded him roundly there were worse husband two night after his friend came to see him
she brought them up to his bedroom the air of which was impregnated with a personal odour and gave them chair at the fire
he sat propped up in the bed by pillows and the little colour in his puffy cheeks made them resemble warm cinders
he apologised to his guests for the disorder of the room but at the same time looked at them a little proudly with a veteran pride
he was quite unconscious that he was the victim of a plot which his friend mr_cunningham mr coy and mr_power had disclosed to mrs mr_kernan in the parlour
mr_kernan tongue the occasional stinging pain of which had made him somewhat irritable during the day became more polite the idea had been mr_power but its development was entrusted to mr_cunningham
mr_kernan came of protestant stock and though he had been converted to the catholic faith at the time of his marriage he had not been in the pale of the church for twenty year
he was fond moreover of giving side thrusts at catholicism mr_cunningham was the very man for such a case he was an elder colleague of mr_power
people had great sympathy with him for it was known that he had married an unpresentable woman who was an incurable drunkard
his own domestic life was not very happy he had set up house for her six time and each time she had pawned the furniture on him
his blade of human knowledge natural astuteness particularised by long association with case in the police courts had been tempered by brief immersions in the waters of general philosophy
everyone had respect for poor martin cunningham he was a thoroughly sensible man influential and intelligent he was well informed his friend bowed to his opinions and considered that his face was like shakespeare
when the plot had been disclosed to her mrs mr_kernan had said i leave it all in your hand mr_cunningham
religion for her was a habit and she suspected that a man of her husband age would not change greatly before death
she was tempted to see a curious appropriateness in his accident and but that she did not wish to seem bloody minded would have told the gentleman that mr_kernan tongue would not suffer by being shortened
after a quarter of a century of married life she had very few illusions left however mr_cunningham was a capable man and religion was religion
she believed steadily in the sacred heart as the most generally useful of all catholic devotions and approved of the sacraments
her faith was bounded by her kitchen but if she was put to it she could believe also in the banshee and in the holy ghost
the scheme might do good and at least it could do no harm her beliefs were not extravagant the gentleman began to talk of the accident
a man of seventy had bitten off a piece of his tongue during an epileptic fit and the tongue had filled in again so that no one could see a trace of the bite
mr_cunningham said that he had once known a similar case well i not seventy said the invalid god forbid said mr_cunningham
it doesnt pain you now asked mr coy mr coy had been at one time a tenor of some reputation
his line of life had not been the shortest distance between two point and for short periods he had been driven to live by his wits
he had been a clerk in the midland railway a canvasser for advertisements for the irish time and for the freeman journal a town traveller for a coal firm on commission a private inquiry agent a clerk in the office of the sub sheriff and he had recently become secretary to the city coroner
his wife who had been a soprano still taught young child to play the piano at low terms his new office made him professionally interested in mr_kernan case
pain not much answered mr_kernan but it so sickening i feel as if i wanted to retch off
that the boose said mr_cunningham firmly no said mr_kernan i think i caught a cold on the car
there something keeps coming into my throat phlegm or mucus said mr coy it keeps coming like from down in my throat sickening
yes yes said mr coy that the thorax he looked at mr_cunningham and mr_power at the same time with an air of challenge
mr_cunningham nodded his head rapidly and mr_power said ah well all well that end well i very much obliged to you old man said the invalid
mr_power waved his hand those other two fellow i was with who were you with asked mr_cunningham
a chap i dont know his name damn it now what his name little chap with sandy hair
and who else harford hm said mr_cunningham when mr_cunningham made that remark people were silent it was known that the speaker had secret sources of information
mr harford sometimes formed one of a little detachment which left the city shortly after noon on sunday with the purpose of arriving as soon as possible at some public house on the outskirts of the city where its members duly qualified themselves as bona fide travellers
in this case the monosyllable had a moral intention but his fellow travellers had never consented to overlook his origin he had begun life as an obscure financier by lending small sums of money to workmen at usurious interest
though he had never embraced more than the jewish ethical code his fellow catholics whenever they had smarted in person or by proxy under his exactions spoke of him bitterly as an irish jew and an illiterate and saw divine disapproval of usury made manifest through the person of his idiot son
later on he had become the partner of a very fat short gentleman mr goldberg in the liffey loan bank at other time they remembered his good point
i wonder where did he go to said mr_kernan he wished the details of the incident to remain vague
he wished his friend to think there had been some mistake that mr harford and he had missed each other his friend who knew quite well mr harford manner in drinking were silent
mr_power said again all well that end well mr_kernan changed the subject at once that was a decent young chap that medical fellow he said
only for him only for him said mr_power it might have been a case of seven day without the option of a fine
yes yes said mr_kernan trying to remember i remember now there was a policeman decent young fellow he seemed
how did it happen at all it happened that you were peloothered tom_burke said mr_cunningham gravely true bill said mr_kernan equally gravely
i suppose you squared the constable jack_mooney said mr coy mr_power did not relish the use of his christian name
he was not straight laced but he could not forget that mr coy had recently made a crusade in search of valises and portmanteaus to enable mrs coy to fulfil imaginary engagements in the country
more than he resented the fact that he had been victimised he resented such low playing of the game he answered the question therefore as if mr_kernan had asked it
he was keenly conscious of his citizenship wished to live with his city on terms mutually honourable and resented any affront put upon him by those whom he called country bumpkins
the narrative made mr_kernan indignant is this what we pay rates for he asked to feed and clothe these ignorant bostooms and they re nothing else
mr_cunningham laughed he was a castle official only during office hour how could they be anything else tom_burke
he said he assumed a thick provincial accent and said in a tone of command catch your cabbage everyone laughed
mr_cunningham said it is supposed they say you know to take place in the depot where they get these thundering big country fellow omadhauns you know to drill
mr coy who wanted to enter the conversation by any door pretended that he had never heard the story the sergeant makes them stand in a row against the wall and hold up their plate
then he has a bloody big bowl of cabbage before him on the table and a bloody big spoon like a shovel
he takes up a wad of cabbage on the spoon and pegs it across the room and the poor devils have to try and catch it on their plate catch your cabbage
he illustrated the story by grotesque gestures at dinner you know everyone laughed again but mr_kernan was somewhat indignant still
he talked of writing a letter to the paper these yahoos coming up here he said think they can boss the people
i neednt tell you martin what kind of man they are mr_cunningham gave a qualified assent it like everything else in this world he said
you get some bad one and you get some good one yes you get some good one i admit said mr_kernan satisfied
it better to have nothing to say to them said mr coy that my opinion mrs mr_kernan entered the room and placing a tray on the table said help yourselves gentleman
she declined it saying she was ironing downstairs and after having exchanged a nod with mr_cunningham behind mr_power back prepared to leave the room
mr_power stood up to officiate offering her his chair her husband called out to her and have you nothing for me duckie
you the back of my hand to you said mrs mr_kernan tartly her husband called after her nothing for poor little hubby
he assumed such a comical face and voice that the distribution of the bottle of stout took place amid general merriment
the gentleman drank from their glass set the glass again on the table and paused then mr_cunningham turned towards mr_power and said casually on thursday night you said jack_mooney
thursday yes said mr_power righto said mr_cunningham promptly we can meet in auley said mr coy that ll be the most convenient place
but we mustnt be late said mr_power earnestly because it is sure to be crammed to the door
we can meet at half seven said mr coy righto said mr_cunningham half seven at auley be it there was a short silence
mr_kernan waited to see whether he would be taken into his friend confidence then he asked what in the wind
it nothing said mr_cunningham it only a little matter that we re arranging about for thursday the opera is it said mr_kernan
no no said mr_cunningham in an evasive tone it just a little spiritual matter said mr_kernan
there was silence again then mr_power said point blank to tell you the truth tom_burke we re going to make a retreat
he uttered the metaphor with a certain homely energy and encouraged by his own voice proceeded you see we may as well all admit we re a nice collection of scoundrels one and all
yes that it said mr_cunningham jack_mooney and i and coy here we re all going to wash the pot i say one and all he added with gruff charity and turning to mr_power
own up now i own up said mr_power and i own up said mr coy so we re going to wash the pot together said mr_cunningham
a thought seemed to strike him he turned suddenly to the invalid and said ye know what tom_burke has just occurred to me
you night join in and we have a four handed reel good idea said mr_power the four of us together
the proposal conveyed very little meaning to his mind but understanding that some spiritual agencies were about to concern themselves on his behalf he thought he owed it to his dignity to show a stiff neck
he took no part in the conversation for a long while but listened with an air of calm enmity while his friend discussed the jesuits
mr_kernan was silent i havent such a bad opinion of the jesuits he said intervening at length
they re an educated order i believe they mean well too they re the grandest order in the church tom_burke said mr_cunningham with enthusiasm
the general of the jesuits stands next to the pope there no mistake about it said mr coy if you want a thing well done and
no flies about you go to a jesuit they re the boyos have influence i ll tell you a case in point the jesuits are a fine body of man said mr_power
every other order of the church had to be reformed at some time or other but the jesuit order was never once reformed
it a curious thing said mr_cunningham about the jesuit order it never fell away is that so asked mr coy
that a fact said mr_cunningham that history look at their church too said mr_power look at the congregation they have
the jesuits cater for the upper classes said mr coy of course said mr_power yes said mr_kernan
that why i have a feeling for them it some of those secular priest ignorant bumptious they re all good man said mr_cunningham each in his own way
the irish priesthood is honoured all the world over yes said mr_power not like some of the other priesthoods on the continent said mr coy unworthy of the name
i havent been in the world all this time and seen most side of it without being a judge of character
perhaps you re right said mr_kernan relenting of course i right said mr_cunningham the gentleman drank again one following another example
mr_kernan seemed to be weighing something in his mind he was impressed he had a high opinion of mr_cunningham as a judge of character and as a reader of face
he asked for particulars it just a retreat you know said mr_cunningham father purdon is giving it
it for business man you know he wont be too hard on us tom_burke said mr_power persuasively father purdon
father purdon said the invalid you must know him tom_burke said mr_cunningham stoutly fine jolly fellow
he a man of the world like ourselves ah yes i think i know him rather red face tall
that the man and tell me martin is he a good preacher munno it not exactly a sermon you know
it just kind of a friendly talk you know in a common sense way mr_kernan deliberated mr coy said father tom_burke that was the boy
father tom_burke said mr_cunningham that was a born orator did you ever hear him tom_burke did i ever hear him said the invalid nettled
rather i heard him and yet they say he wasnt much of a theologian said mr_cunningham is that so said mr coy
of course nothing wrong you know only sometimes they say he didnt preach what was quite orthodox ah he was a splendid man said mr coy
i heard him once mr_kernan continued i forget the subject of his discourse now mr_crofton and i were in the back of the pit
you know the the body said mr_cunningham yes in the back near the door i forget now what
o yes it was on the pope the late pope i remember it well upon my word it was magnificent the style of the oratory
and his voice god hadnt he a voice the prisoner of the vatican he called him i remember mr_crofton saying to me when we came out
but he an orangeman mr_crofton isnt he said mr_power course he is said mr_kernan and a damned decent orangeman too
we went into butler in moore street faith i was genuinely moved tell you the god truth and i remember well his very word
mr_kernan he said we worship at different altars he said but our belief is the same struck me as very well put
there a good deal in that said mr_power there used always to be crowd of protestants in the chapel where father tom_burke was preaching
there not much difference between us said mr coy we both believe in he hesitated for a moment in the redeemer
only they dont believe in the pope and in the mother of god but of course said mr_cunningham quietly and effectively our religion is the religion the old original faith
not a doubt of it said mr_kernan warmly mrs mr_kernan came to the door of the bedroom and announced here a visitor for you
who is it mr_fogarty come in come in a pale oval face came forward into the light
the arch of its fair trailing moustache was repeated in the fair eyebrows looped above pleasantly astonished eye mr_fogarty was a modest grocer
he had failed in business in a licensed house in the city because his financial condition had constrained him to tie himself to second class distillers and brewers
he had opened a small shop on glasnevin road where he flattered himself his manner would ingratiate him with the housewives of the district
he bore himself with a certain grace complimented little child and spoke with a neat enunciation he was not without culture
he inquired politely for mr_kernan placed his gift on the table and sat down with the company on equal terms
mr_kernan appreciated the gift all the more since he was aware that there was a small account for groceries unsettled between him and mr_fogarty
mr_fogarty brought a gift with him a half pint of special whisky he said i wouldnt doubt you old man open that jack_mooney will you
mr_power again officiated glass were rinsed and five small measures of whisky were poured out this new influence enlivened the conversation
mr_fogarty sitting on a small area of the chair was specially interested pope leo_dillon xiii said mr_cunningham was one of the light of the age
his great idea you know was the union of the latin and greek churches that was the aim of his life
i often heard he was one of the most intellectual man in europe said mr_power i mean apart from his being pope
so he was said mr_cunningham if not the most so his motto you know as pope was lux upon lux light upon light
no no said mr_fogarty eagerly i think you re wrong there it was lux in tenebris i think light in darkness
and pius ix his predecessor motto was crux upon crux that is cross upon cross to show the difference between their two pontificates
yes said mr coy tenebrae allow me said mr_cunningham positively it was lux upon lux the inference was allowed
mr_cunningham continued pope leo_dillon you know was a great scholar and a poet he had a strong face said mr_kernan
mr coy tasted his whisky contentedly and shook his head with a double intention saying that no joke i can tell you
yes said mr_cunningham he wrote latin poetry is that so said mr_fogarty we didnt learn that tom_burke said mr_power following mr coy example when we went to the penny a week school
there was many a good man went to the penny a week school with a sod of turf under his oxter said mr_kernan sententiously
the old system was the best plain honest education none of your modern trumpery quite right said mr_power
i remember reading said mr_cunningham that one of pope leo_dillon poems was on the invention of the photograph in latin of course
no superfluities said mr_fogarty he enunciated the word and then drank gravely on the photograph exclaimed mr_kernan
yes said mr_cunningham he also drank from his glass well you know said mr coy isnt the photograph wonderful when you come to think of it
of course said mr_power great mind can see thing as the poet says great mind are very near to madness said mr_fogarty
mr_kernan seemed to be troubled in mind he made an effort to recall the protestant theology on some thorny point and in the end addressed mr_cunningham
tell me martin he said werent some of the popes of course not our present man or his predecessor but some of the old popes not exactly
you know up to the knocker there was a silence mr_cunningham said of course there were some bad lots
not one of them not the biggest drunkard not the most out and out ruffian not one of them ever preached ex cathedra a word of false doctrine
but the astonishing thing is this now isnt that an astonishing thing that is said mr_kernan yes because when the pope speaks ex cathedra mr_fogarty explained he is infallible
yes said mr_cunningham i know about the infallibility of the pope i remember i was younger then
or was it that mr_fogarty interrupted he took up the bottle and helped the other to a little more
mr coy seeing that there was not enough to go round pleaded that he had not finished his first measure the other accepted under protest
the light music of whisky falling into glass made an agreeable interlude what that you were saying tom_burke asked mr coy
papal infallibility said mr_cunningham that was the greatest scene in the whole history of the church how was that martin asked mr_power
in the sacred college you know of cardinals and archbishops and bishops there were two man who held out against it while the other were all for it
mr_cunningham held up two thick finger the whole conclave except these two was unanimous no they wouldnt have it
ha said mr coy and they were a german cardinal by the name of dolling or dowling or
dowling was no german and that a sure five said mr_power laughing well this great german cardinal whatever his name was was one and the other was john machale
what cried mr_kernan is it john of tuam are you sure of that now asked mr_fogarty dubiously
i thought it was some italian or american john of tuam repeated mr_cunningham was the man he drank and the other gentleman followed his lead
then he resumed there they were at it all the cardinals and bishops and archbishops from all the end of the earth and these two fighting dog and devil until at last the pope himself stood up and declared infallibility a dogma of the church ex cathedra
on the very moment john machale who had been arguing and arguing against it stood up and shouted out with the voice of a lion credo
i believe said mr_fogarty credo said mr_cunningham that showed the faith he had he submitted the moment the pope spoke
and what about dowling asked mr coy the german cardinal wouldnt submit he left the church mr_cunningham word had built up the vast image of the church in the mind of his hearers
his deep raucous voice had thrilled them as it uttered the word of belief and submission when mrs mr_kernan came into the room drying her hand she came into a solemn company
she did not disturb the silence but leaned over the rail at the foot of the bed i once saw john machale said mr_kernan and i ll never forget it as long as i live
he turned towards his wife to be confirmed i often told you that mrs mr_kernan nodded it was at the unveiling of sir john gray statue
edmund dwyer gray was speaking blathering away and here was this old fellow crabbed looking old chap looking at him from under his bushy eyebrows
mr_kernan knitted his brows and lowering his head like an angry bull glared at his wife god he exclaimed resuming his natural face i never saw such an eye in a man head
it was as much as to say i have you properly taped my lad he had an eye like a hawk
mr_power turned to mrs mr_kernan and said with abrupt joviality well mrs mr_kernan we re going to make your man here a good holy pious and god fearing roman catholic
none of the grays was any good said mr_power there was a pause again he swept his arm round the company inclusively
we re all going to make a retreat together and confess our sins and god knows we want it badly i dont mind said mr_kernan smiling a little nervously
mrs mr_kernan thought it would be wiser to conceal her satisfaction so she said i pity the poor priest that has to listen to your tale
mr_kernan expression changed if he doesnt like it he said bluntly he can do the other thing i ll just tell him my little tale of woe
i not such a bad fellow mr_cunningham intervened promptly we ll all renounce the devil he said together not forgetting his work and pomps
get behind me satan said mr_fogarty laughing and looking at the other mr_power said nothing he felt completely out generalled
all we have to do said mr_cunningham is to stand up with lighted candle in our hand and renew our baptismal vows
but a pleased expression flickered across his face dont forget the candle tom_burke said mr coy whatever you do
what said mr_kernan must i have a candle yes said mr_cunningham no damn it all said mr_kernan sensibly i draw the line there
i ll do the job right enough i ll do the retreat business and confession and all that business but no candle no damn it all i bar the candle
i bar the candle said mr_kernan conscious of having created an effect on his audience and continuing to shake his head to and fro
he shook his head with farcical gravity listen to that said his wife i bar the magic lantern business
everyone laughed heartily there a nice catholic for you said his wife no candle repeated mr_kernan obdurately
the transept of the jesuit church in gardiner street was almost full and still at every moment gentleman entered from the side door and directed by the lay brother walked on tiptoe along the aisles until they found seating accommodation
the light of the lamp of the church fell upon an assembly of black clothes and white collars relieved here and there by tweeds on dark mottled pillars of green marble and on lugubrious canvases
that off the gentleman were all well dressed and orderly the gentleman sat in the benches having hitched their trousers slightly above their knees and laid their hat in security
they sat well back and gazed formally at the distant speck of red light which was suspended before the high altar
in one of the benches near the pulpit sat mr_cunningham and mr_kernan in the bench behind sat mr coy alone and in the bench behind him sat mr_power and mr_fogarty
mr coy had tried unsuccessfully to find a place in the bench with the other and when the party had settled down in the form of a quincunx he had tried unsuccessfully to make comic remarks
as these had not been well received he had desisted even he was sensible of the decorous atmosphere and even he began to respond to the religious stimulus
in a whisper mr_cunningham drew mr_kernan attention to mr harford the moneylender who sat some distance off and to mr fanning the registration agent and mayor maker of the city who was sitting immediately under the pulpit beside one of the newly elected councillors of the ward
to the right sat old michael grimes the owner of three pawnbroker shop and dan hogan nephew who was up for the job in the town clerk office
farther in front sat mr hendrick the chief reporter of the freeman journal and poor carroll an old friend of mr_kernan who had been at one time a considerable commercial figure
gradually as he recognised familiar face mr_kernan began to feel more at home his hat which had been rehabilitated by his wife rested upon his knees
once or twice he pulled down his cuffs with one hand while he held the brim of his hat lightly but firmly with the other hand
a powerful looking figure the upper part of which was draped with a white surplice was observed to be struggling into the pulpit
the priest figure now stood upright in the pulpit two thirds of its bulk crowned by a massive red face appearing above the balustrade
simultaneously the congregation unsettled produced handkerchiefs and knelt upon them with care mr_kernan followed the general example father purdon knelt down turned towards the red speck of light and covering his face with his hand prayed
after an interval he uncovered his face and rose the congregation rose also and settled again on its benches mr_kernan restored his hat to its original position on his knee and presented an attentive face to the preacher
the preacher turned back each wide sleeve of his surplice with an elaborate large gesture and slowly surveyed the array of face
wherefore make unto yourselves friend out of the mammon of iniquity so that when you die they may receive you into everlasting dwellings
then he said for the child of this world are wiser in their generation than the child of light father purdon developed the text with resonant assurance
it was a text which might seem to the casual observer at variance with the lofty morality elsewhere preached by jesus christ
but he told his hearers the text had seemed to him specially adapted for the guidance of those whose lot it was to lead the life of the world and who yet wished to lead that life not in the manner of worldlings
it was one of the most difficult texts in all the scriptures he said to interpret properly it was a text for business man and professional man
jesus christ with his divine understanding of every cranny of our human nature understood that all man were not called to the religious life that by far the vast majority were forced to live in the world and to a certain extent for the world and in this sentence he designed to give them a word of counsel setting before them as exemplars in the religious life those very worshippers of mammon who were of all man the least solicitous in matter religious
he told his hearers that he was there that evening for no terrifying no extravagant purpose but as a man of the world speaking to his fellow man
if he might use the metaphor he said he was their spiritual accountant and he wished each and every one of his hearers to open his book the book of his spiritual life and see if they tallied accurately with conscience
he came to speak to business man and he would speak to them in a businesslike way jesus christ was not a hard taskmaster
he understood our little failings understood the weakness of our poor fallen nature understood the temptations of this life we might have had we all had from time to time
our temptations we might have we all had our failings but one thing only he said he would ask of his hearers
and that was to be straight and manly with god if their accounts tallied in every point to say well i have verified my accounts
but if as might happen there were some discrepancies to admit the truth to be frank and say like a man well i have looked into my accounts
i find all well i find this wrong and this wrong but with god grace i will rectify this and this
hardly had she brought one gentleman into the little pantry behind the office on the ground floor and helped him off with his overcoat than the wheezy hall door bell clanged again
i will set right my accounts the dead lily the caretaker daughter was literally run off her foot and she had to scamper along the bare hallway to let in another guest
it was well for her she had not to attend to the lady also but miss_kate and miss_julia had thought of that and had converted the bathroom upstairs into a lady dressing room
miss_kate and miss_julia were there gossiping and laughing and fussing walking after each other to the head of the stair peering down over the banisters and calling down to lily to ask her who had come
everybody who knew them came to it members of the family old friend of the family the members of miss_julia choir any of miss_kate pupils that were grown up enough and even some of mary_jane pupils too
for year and year it had gone off in splendid style as long as anyone could remember ever since miss_kate and miss_julia after the death of their brother pat had left the house in stoney batter and taken mary_jane their only niece to live with them in the dark gaunt house on usher island the upper part of which they had rented from mr fulham the corn factor on the ground floor
it was always a great affair the misses miss_morkan annual dance never once had it fallen flat that was a good thirty year ago if it was a day
mary_jane who was then a little girl in short clothes was now the main prop of the household for she had the organ in haddington road
she had been through the academy and gave a pupils concert every year in the upper room of the antient concert room
many of her pupils belonged to the better class families on the kingstown and dalkey line old as they were her aunt also did their share
miss_julia though she was quite grey was still the leading soprano in adam and eve and miss_kate being too feeble to go about much gave music lessons to beginners on the old square piano in the back room
though their life was modest they believed in eating well the best of everything diamond bone sirloins three shilling tea and the best bottled stout
lily the caretaker daughter did housemaid work for them but lily seldom made a mistake in the order so that she got on well with her three mistresses
they were fussy that was all but the only thing they would not stand was back answers of course they had good reason to be fussy on such a night
and then it was long after ten clock and yet there was no sign of gabriel and his wife besides they were dreadfully afraid that freddy_malins might turn up screwed
they would not wish for world that any of mary_jane pupils should see him under the influence and when he was like that it was sometimes very hard to manage him
freddy_malins always came late but they wondered what could be keeping gabriel and that was what brought them every two minute to the banisters to ask lily had gabriel or freddy_malins come
o mr conroy said lily to gabriel when she opened the door for him miss_kate and miss_julia thought you were never coming
good night mrs_conroy i ll engage they did said gabriel but they forget that my wife here takes three mortal hour to dress herself
he stood on the mat scraping the snow from his goloshes while lily led his wife to the foot of the stair and called out miss_kate here mrs_conroy
miss_kate and miss_julia came toddling down the dark stair at once both of them kissed gabriel wife said she must be perished alive and asked was gabriel with her
here i am as right as the mail aunt miss_kate go on up i ll follow called out gabriel from the dark
a light fringe of snow lay like a cape on the shoulder of his overcoat and like toecaps on the toes of his goloshes and as the buttons of his overcoat slipped with a squeaking noise through the snow stiffened frieze a cold fragrant air from out of door escaped from crevices and folds
he continued scraping his foot vigorously while the three woman went upstairs laughing to the lady dressing room is it snowing again mr conroy asked lily
she had preceded him into the pantry to help him off with his overcoat gabriel smiled at the three syllables she had given his surname and glanced at her
she was a slim growing girl pale in complexion and with hay coloured hair the gas in the pantry made her look still paler
gabriel had known her when she was a child and used to sit on the lowest step nursing a rag doll
he looked up at the pantry ceiling which was shaking with the stamping and shuffling of foot on the floor above listened for a moment to the piano and then glanced at the girl who was folding his overcoat carefully at the end of a shelf
yes lily he answered and i think we re in for a night of it tell me lily he said in a friendly tone do you still go to school
then said gabriel gaily i suppose we ll be going to your wedding one of these fine day with your young man eh
the girl glanced back at him over her shoulder and said with great bitterness the man that is now is only all palaver and what they can get out of you
gabriel coloured as if he felt he had made a mistake and without looking at her kicked off his goloshes and flicked actively with his muffler at his patent leather shoes
no sir she answered i done schooling this year and more he was a stout tallish young man
the high colour of his cheeks pushed upwards even to his forehead where it scattered itself in a few formless patches of pale red and on his hairless face there scintillated restlessly the polished lenses and the bright gilt rims of the glass which screened his delicate and restless eye
his glossy black hair was parted in the middle and brushed in a long curve behind his ear where it curled slightly beneath the groove left by his hat
when he had flicked lustre into his shoes he stood up and pulled his waistcoat down more tightly on his plump body
then he took a coin rapidly from his pocket lily he said thrusting it into her hand it christmastime isnt it
just here a little he walked rapidly towards the door no sir cried the girl following him
really sir i wouldnt take it christmas time christmas time said gabriel almost trotting to the stair and waving his hand to her in deprecation
he waited outside the drawing room door until the waltz should finish listening to the skirts that swept against it and to the shuffling of foot
the girl seeing that he had gained the stair called out after him well thank you sir he was still discomposed by the girl bitter and sudden retort
it had cast a gloom over him which he tried to dispel by arranging his cuffs and the bows of his tie
he then took from his waistcoat pocket a little paper and glanced at the headings he had made for his speech
he was undecided about the lines from robert browning for he feared they would be above the head of his hearers
the indelicate clacking of the man heels and the shuffling of their soles reminded him that their grade of culture differed from his
some quotation that they would recognise from shakespeare or from the melodies would be better he would only make himself ridiculous by quoting poetry to them which they could not understand
they would think that he was airing his superior education he would fail with them just as he had failed with the girl in the pantry
he had taken up a wrong tone his whole speech was a mistake from first to last an utter failure just then his aunt and his wife came out of the lady dressing room
her hair drawn low over the tops of her ear was grey and grey also with darker shadows was her large flaccid face
though she was stout in build and stood erect her slow eye and parted lip gave her the appearance of a woman who did not know where she was or where she was going
his aunt were two small plainly dressed old woman aunt miss_julia was an inch or so the taller aunt miss_kate was more vivacious
her face healthier than her sister was all puckers and creases like a shrivelled red apple and her hair braided in the same old fashioned way had not lost its ripe nut colour
he was their favourite nephew the son of their dead elder sister ellen who had marriedt conroy of the port and docks
they both kissed gabriel frankly gretta tells me you re not going to take a cab back to monkstown tonight gabriel said aunt miss_kate
no said gabriel turning to his wife we had quite enough of that last year hadnt we dont you remember aunt miss_kate what a cold gretta got out of it
cab window rattling all the way and the east wind blowing in after we passed merrion very jolly it was gretta caught a dreadful cold
aunt miss_kate frowned severely and nodded her head at every word quite right gabriel quite right she said
you cant be too careful but as for gretta there said gabriel she walk home in the snow if she were let
he really an awful bother what with green shades for tom_burke eye at night and making him do the dumb bells and forcing eva to eat the stirabout
mrs_conroy laughed dont mind him aunt miss_kate she said the poor child and she simply hates the sight of it
she broke out into a peal of laughter and glanced at her husband whose admiring and happy eye had been wandering from her dress to her face and hair
o but you ll never guess what he makes me wear now the two aunt laughed heartily too for gabriel solicitude was a standing joke with them
goloshes said mrs_conroy that the latest whenever it wet underfoot i must put on my galoshes tonight even he wanted me to put them on but i wouldnt
gabriel laughed nervously and patted his tie reassuringly while aunt miss_kate nearly doubled herself so heartily did she enjoy the joke
the next thing he ll buy me will be a diving suit the smile soon faded from aunt miss_julia face and her mirthless eye were directed towards her nephew face
after a pause she asked and what are goloshes gabriel goloshes miss_julia exclaimed her sister goodness me dont you know what goloshes are
you wear them over your over your boots gretta isnt it yes said mrs_conroy guttapercha thing we both have a pair now
gabriel knitted his brows and said as if he were slightly angered it nothing very wonderful but gretta thinks it very funny because she says the word reminds her of christy minstrels
gabriel says everyone wears them on the continent on the continent murmured aunt miss_julia nodding her head slowly but tell me gabriel said aunt miss_kate with brisk tact
of course you ve seen about the room gretta was saying the room is all right replied gabriel i ve taken one in the gresham
to be sure said aunt miss_kate by far the best thing to do and the child gretta you re not anxious about them
for one night said mrs_conroy besides bessie will look after them to be sure said aunt miss_kate again
what a comfort it is to have a girl like that one you can depend on there that lily i sure i dont know what has come over her lately
gabriel was about to ask his aunt some question on this point but she broke off suddenly to gaze after her sister who had wandered down the stair and was craning her neck over the banisters
she not the girl she was at all now i ask you she said almost testily where is miss_julia going
miss_julia julia where are you going miss_julia who had gone half way down one flight came back and announced blandly here freddy_malins
at the same moment a clapping of hand and a final flourish of the pianist told that the waltz had ended
the drawing room door was opened from within and some couples came out aunt miss_kate drew gabriel aside hurriedly and whispered into his ear
slip down gabriel like a good fellow and see if he all right and dont let him up if he screwed
i sure he screwed i sure he is gabriel went to the stair and listened over the banisters he could hear two person talking in the pantry
then he recognised freddy_malins laugh he went down the stair noisily it such a relief said aunt miss_kate to mrs_conroy that gabriel is here
i always feel easier in my mind when he here miss_julia there miss daly and miss power will take some refreshment
a tall wizen faced man with a stiff grizzled moustache and swarthy skin who was passing out with his partner said and may we have some refreshment too miss_morkan
thanks for your beautiful waltz miss daly it made lovely time miss_julia said aunt miss_kate summarily and here mr_browne and miss furlong
i the man for the lady said mr_browne pursing his lip until his moustache bristled and smiling in all his wrinkles
take them in miss_julia with miss daly and miss power you know miss_morkan the reason they are so fond of me is
he did not finish his sentence but seeing that aunt miss_kate was out of earshot at once led the three young lady into the back room
the middle of the room was occupied by two square table placed end to end and on these aunt miss_julia and the caretaker were straightening and smoothing a large cloth
on the sideboard were arrayed dishes and plate and glass and bundles of knives and forks and spoons the top of the closed square piano served also as a sideboard for viands and sweets
at a smaller sideboard in one corner two young man were standing drinking hop bitters mr_browne led his charges thither and invited them all in jest to some lady punch hot strong and sweet
then he asked one of the young man to move aside and taking hold of the decanter filled out for himself a goodly measure of whisky
as they said they never took anything strong he opened three bottle of lemonade for them the young man eyed him respectfully while he took a trial sip
his wizened face broke into a broader smile and the three young lady laughed in musical echo to his pleasantry swaying their body to and fro with nervous jerks of their shoulder
god help me he said smiling it the doctor order the boldest said now mr_browne i sure the doctor never ordered anything of the kind
mr_browne took another sip of his whisky and said with sidling mimicry well you see i like the famous mrs cassidy who is reported to have said now mary_jane grimes if i dont take it make me take it for i feel i want it
his hot face had leaned forward a little too confidentially and he had assumed a very low dublin accent so that the young lady with one instinct received his speech in silence
miss furlong who was one of mary_jane pupils asked miss daly what was the name of the pretty waltz she had played and mr_browne seeing that he was ignored turned promptly to the two young man who were more appreciative
a red faced young woman dressed in pansy came into the room excitedly clapping her hand and crying quadrilles quadrilles
close on her heels came aunt miss_kate crying two gentleman and three lady mary_jane here mr bergin and mr kerrigan said mary_jane
mr kerrigan will you take miss power miss furlong may i get you a partner mr bergin that ll just do now
three lady mary_jane said aunt miss_kate the two young gentleman asked the lady if they might have the pleasure and mary_jane turned to miss daly
o miss daly you re really awfully good after playing for the last two dances but really we re so short of lady tonight
i dont mind in the least miss_morkan but i ve a nice partner for you mr bartell arcy the tenor
as the piano had twice begun the prelude to the first figure mary_jane led her recruits quickly from the room
i ll get him to sing later on all dublin is raving about him lovely voice lovely voice said aunt miss_kate they had hardly gone when aunt miss_julia wandered slowly into the room looking behind her at something
miss_julia who was carrying in a column of table napkins turned to her sister and said simply as if the question had surprised her it only freddy_malins miss_kate and gabriel with him
what is the matter miss_julia asked aunt miss_kate anxiously who is it in fact right behind her gabriel could be seen piloting freddy_malins across the landing
his face was fleshy and pallid touched with colour only at the thick hanging lobes of his ear and at the wide wings of his nose
the latter a young man of about forty was of gabriel size and build with very round shoulder he had coarse features a blunt nose a convex and receding brow tumid and protruded lip
he was laughing heartily in a high key at a story which he had been telling gabriel on the stair and at the same time rubbing the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye
freddy_malins bade the misses miss_morkan good evening in what seemed an offhand fashion by reason of the habitual catch in his voice
and then seeing that mr_browne was grinning at him from the sideboard crossed the room on rather shaky legs and began to repeat in an undertone the story he had just told to gabriel
his heavy lidded eye and the disorder of his scanty hair made him look sleepy good evening freddy_malins said aunt miss_julia
he not so bad is he said aunt miss_kate to gabriel gabriel brows were dark but he raised them quickly and answered no hardly noticeable
now isnt he a terrible fellow she said and his poor mother made him take the pledge on new year eve
before leaving the room with gabriel she signalled to mr_browne by frowning and shaking her forefinger in warning to and fro
mr_browne nodded in answer and when she had gone said to freddy_malins now then teddy i going to fill you out a good glass of lemonade just to buck you up
freddy_malins who was nearing the climax of his story waved the offer aside impatiently but mr_browne having first called freddy_malins attention to a disarray in his dress filled out and handed him a full glass of lemonade
but come on gabriel into the drawing room freddy_malins left hand accepted the glass mechanically his right hand being engaged in the mechanical readjustment of his dress
mr_browne whose face was once more wrinkling with mirth poured out for himself a glass of whisky while freddy_malins exploded before he had well reached the climax of his story in a kink of high pitched bronchitic laughter and setting down his untasted and overflowing glass began to rub the knuckles of his left fist backwards and forwards into his left eye repeating word of his last phrase as well as his fit of laughter would allow him
gabriel could not listen while mary_jane was playing her academy piece full of runs and difficult passages to the hushed drawing room
he liked music but the piece she was playing had no melody for him and he doubted whether it had any melody for the other listeners though they had begged mary_jane to play something
four young man who had come from the refreshment room to stand in the doorway at the sound of the piano had gone away quietly in couples after a few minute
the only person who seemed to follow the music were mary_jane herself her hand racing along the key board or lifted from it at the pauses like those of a priestess in momentary imprecation and aunt miss_kate standing at her elbow to turn the page
gabriel eye irritated by the floor which glittered with beeswax under the heavy chandelier wandered to the wall above the piano
and beside it was a picture of the two murdered princes in the tower which aunt miss_julia had worked in red blue and brown wools when she was a girl
a picture of the balcony scene in romeo and juliet hung there probably in the school they had gone to as girl that kind of work had been taught for one year
his mother had worked for him as a birthday present a waistcoat of purple tabinet with little foxes head upon it lined with brown satin and having round mulberry buttons
it was strange that his mother had had no musical talent though aunt miss_kate used to call her the brains carrier of the miss_morkan family
both she and miss_julia had always seemed a little proud of their serious and matronly sister her photograph stood before the pierglass
she held an open book on her knees and was pointing out something in it to constantine who dressed in a man war suit lay at her foot
it was she who had chosen the name of her son for she was very sensible of the dignity of family life
thanks to her constantine was now senior curate in balbrigan and thanks to her gabriel himself had taken his degree in the royal university
some slighting phrases she had used still rankled in his memory she had once spoken of gretta as being country cute and that was not true of gretta at all
a shadow passed over his face as he remembered her sullen opposition to his marriage it was gretta who had nursed her during all her last long illness in their house at monkstown
he knew that mary_jane must be near the end of her piece for she was playing again the opening melody with runs of scales after every bar and while he waited for the end the resentment died down in his heart
the piece ended with a trill of octaves in the treble and a final deep octave in the bass great applause greeted mary_jane as blushing and rolling up her music nervously she escaped from the room
the most vigorous clapping came from the four young man in the doorway who had gone away to the refreshment room at the beginning of the piece but had come back when the piano had stopped
lancers were arranged gabriel found himself partnered with miss ivors she was a frank mannered talkative young lady with a freckled face and prominent brown eye
she did not wear a low cut bodice and the large brooch which was fixed in the front of her collar bore on it an irish device and motto
when they had taken their place she said abruptly i have a crow to pluck with you with me said gabriel
she nodded her head gravely what is it asked gabriel smiling at her solemn manner who is c answered miss ivors turning her eye upon him
gabriel coloured and was about to knit his brows as if he did not understand when she said bluntly innocent amy
i have found out that you write for the daily express now arent you ashamed of yourself why should i be ashamed of myself
asked gabriel blinking his eye and trying to smile well i ashamed of you said miss ivors frankly
to say you write for a paper like that i didnt think you were a west briton a look of perplexity appeared on gabriel face
it was true that he wrote a literary column every wednesday in the daily express for which he was paid fifteen shillings
but that did not make him a west briton surely the book he received for review were almost more welcome than the paltry cheque
nearly every day when his teaching in the college was ended he used to wander down the quays to the second hand booksellers to hickey on bachelor walk to web or massey on aston quay or to clohissey in the by street
he loved to feel the covers and turn over the pages of newly printed book he did not know how to meet her charge
but they were friend of many year standing and their careers had been parallel first at the university and then as teachers he could not risk a grandiose phrase with her
he continued blinking his eye and trying to smile and murmured lamely that he saw nothing political in writing reviews of book
he wanted to say that literature was above politics when their turn to cross had come he was still perplexed and inattentive
miss ivors promptly took his hand in a warm grasp and said in a soft friendly tone of course i was only joking
come we cross now when they were together again she spoke of the university question and gabriel felt more at ease
a friend of hers had shown her his review of browning poems that was how she had found out the secret but she liked the review immensely
then she said suddenly mr conroy will you come for an excursion to the aran isles this summer we re going to stay there a whole month
it will be splendid out in the atlantic you ought to come mr clancy is coming and mr kilkelly and miss_kathleen_kearney
it would be splendid for gretta too if she come she from connacht isnt she her people are said gabriel shortly
but you will come wont you said miss ivors laying her warm hand eagerly on his arm the fact is said gabriel i have just arranged to go go where asked miss ivors
well you know every year i go for a cycling tour with some fellow and so but where
asked miss ivors well we usually go to france or belgium or perhaps germany said gabriel awkwardly and why do you go to france and belgium said miss ivors instead of visiting your own land
well said gabriel it partly to keep in touch with the languages and partly for a change and havent you your own language to keep in touch with irish asked miss ivors
well said gabriel if it comes to that you know irish is not my language their neighbours had turned to listen to the cross examination
gabriel glanced right and left nervously and tried to keep his good humour under the ordeal which was making a blush invade his forehead
and havent you your own land to visit continued miss ivors that you know nothing of your own people and your own country
to tell you the truth retorted gabriel suddenly i sick of my own country sick of it why asked miss ivors
they had to go visiting together and as he had not answered her miss ivors said warmly of course you ve no answer
gabriel did not answer for his retort had heated him why repeated miss ivors gabriel tried to cover his agitation by taking part in the dance with great energy
he avoided her eye for he had seen a sour expression on her face but when they met in the long chain he was surprised to feel his hand firmly pressed
then just as the chain was about to start again she stood on tiptoe and whispered into his ear west briton
when the lancers were over gabriel went away to a remote corner of the room where freddy_malins mother was sitting
she looked at him from under her brows for a moment quizzically until he smiled she was a stout feeble old woman with white hair
her voice had a catch in it like her son and she stuttered slightly she had been told that freddy_malins had come and that he was nearly all right
gabriel asked her whether she had had a good crossing she lived with her married daughter in glasgow and came to dublin on a visit once a year
she answered placidly that she had had a beautiful crossing and that the captain had been most attentive to her she spoke also of the beautiful house her daughter kept in glasgow and of all the friend they had there
while her tongue rambled on gabriel tried to banish from his mind all memory of the unpleasant incident with miss ivors
of course the girl or woman or whatever she was was an enthusiast but there was a time for all thing
perhaps he ought not to have answered her like that but she had no right to call him a west briton before people even in joke
she had tried to make him ridiculous before people heckling him and staring at him with her rabbit eye he saw his wife making her way towards him through the waltzing couples
when she reached him she said into his ear gabriel aunt miss_kate wants to know wont you carve the goose as usual
she sending in the younger one first as soon as this waltz is over so that we ll have the table to ourselves
miss daly will carve the ham and i ll do the pudding all right said gabriel were you dancing asked gabriel
of course i was didnt you see me what row had you with molly ivors no row why did she say so
something like that i trying to get that mr arcy to sing he full of conceit i think
there was no row said gabriel moodily only she wanted me to go for a trip to the west of ireland
and i said i wouldnt his wife clasped her hand excitedly and gave a little jump do go gabriel she cried
she looked at him for a moment then turned to mrs freddy_malins and said there a nice husband for you mrs freddy_malins
while she was threading her way back across the room mrs freddy_malins without adverting to the interruption went on to tell gabriel what beautiful place there were in scotland and beautiful scenery
i love to see galway again you can go if you like said gabriel coldly her son in law brought them every year to the lakes and they used to go fishing
her son in law was a splendid fisher one day he caught a beautiful big fish and the man in the hotel cooked it for their dinner
gabriel hardly heard what she said now that supper was coming near he began to think again about his speech and about the quotation
when he saw freddy_malins coming across the room to visit his mother gabriel left the chair free for him and retired into the embrasure of the window
the room had already cleared and from the back room came the clatter of plate and knives those who still remained in the drawing room seemed tired of dancing and were conversing quietly in little groups
gabriel warm trembling finger tapped the cold pane of the window how cool it must be outside how pleasant it would be to walk out alone first along by the river and then through the park
the snow would be lying on the branches of the trees and forming a bright cap on the top of the wellington monument
how much more pleasant it would be there than at the supper table he ran over the headings of his speech irish hospitality sad memory the three graces paris the quotation from browning
he repeated to himself a phrase he had written in his review one feels that one is listening to a thought tormented music
miss ivors had praised the review was she sincere had she really any life of her own behind all her propagandism
it unnerved him to think that she would be at the supper table looking up at him while he spoke with her critical quizzing eye
there had never been any ill feeling between them until that night perhaps she would not be sorry to see him fail in his speech
he would say alluding to aunt miss_kate and aunt miss_julia lady and gentleman the generation which is now on the wane among us may have had its faults but for my part i think it had certain qualities of hospitality of humour of humanity which the new and very serious and hypereducated generation that is growing up around us seems to me to lack
an idea came into his mind and gave him courage very good that was one for miss ivors what did he care that his aunt were only two ignorant old woman
mr_browne was advancing from the door gallantly escorting aunt miss_julia who leaned upon his arm smiling and hanging her head
an irregular musketry of applause escorted her also as far as the piano and then as mary_jane seated herself on the stool and aunt miss_julia no longer smiling half turned so as to pitch her voice fairly into the room gradually ceased
a murmur in the room attracted his attention gabriel recognised the prelude it was that of an old song of aunt miss_julia arrayed for the bridal
her voice strong and clear in tone attacked with great spirit the runs which embellish the air and though she sang very rapidly she did not miss even the smallest of the grace note
to follow the voice without looking at the singer face was to feel and share the excitement of swift and secure flight
gabriel applauded loudly with all the other at the close of the song and loud applause was borne in from the invisible supper table
it sounded so genuine that a little colour struggled into aunt miss_julia face as she bent to replace in the music stand the old leather bound songbook that had her initials on the cover
freddy_malins who had listened with his head perched sideways to hear her better was still applauding when everyone else had ceased and talking animatedly to his mother who nodded her head gravely and slowly in acquiescence
at last when he could clap no more he stood up suddenly and hurried across the room to aunt miss_julia whose hand he seized and held in both his hand shaking it when word failed him or the catch in his voice proved too much for him
i was just telling my mother he said i never heard you sing so well never no i never heard your voice so good as it is tonight
now would you believe that now that the truth upon my word and honour that the truth i never heard your voice sound so fresh
and so so clear and fresh never aunt miss_julia smiled broadly and murmured something about compliments as she released her hand from his grasp
mr_browne extended his open hand towards her and said to those who were near him in the manner of a showman introducing a prodigy to an audience miss_julia miss_morkan my latest discovery
he was laughing very heartily at this himself when freddy_malins turned to him and said well mr_browne if you re serious you might make a worse discovery
all i can say is i never heard her sing half so well as long as i am coming here
and that the honest truth neither did i said mr_browne i think her voice has greatly improved
aunt miss_julia shrugged her shoulder and said with meek pride thirty year ago i hadnt a bad voice as voice go
i often told miss_julia said aunt miss_kate emphatically that she was simply thrown away in that choir but she never would be said by me
she turned as if to appeal to the good sense of the other against a refractory child while aunt miss_julia gazed in front of her a vague smile of reminiscence playing on her face
no continued aunt miss_kate she wouldnt be said or led by anyone slaving there in that choir night and day night and day
six clock on christmas morning and all for what well isnt it for the honour of god aunt miss_kate asked mary_jane twisting round on the piano stool and smiling
aunt miss_kate turned fiercely on her niece and said i know all about the honour of god mary_jane but i think it not at all honourable for the pope to turn out the woman out of the choirs that have slaved there all their life and put little whipper snappers of boy over their head
i suppose it is for the good of the church if the pope does it but it not just mary_jane and it not right
she had worked herself into a passion and would have continued in defence of her sister for it was a sore subject with her but mary_jane seeing that all the dancers had come back intervened pacifically now aunt miss_kate you re giving scandal to mr_browne who is of the other persuasion
aunt miss_kate turned to mr_browne who was grinning at this allusion to his religion and said hastily i dont question the pope being right
i only a stupid old woman and i wouldnt presume to do such a thing but there such a thing as common everyday politeness and gratitude
and besides aunt miss_kate said mary_jane we really are all hungry and when we are hungry we are all very quarrelsome
and if i were in miss_julia place i tell that father healey straight up to his face
and when we are thirsty we are also quarrelsome added mr_browne so that we had better go to supper said mary_jane and finish the discussion afterwards
on the landing outside the drawing room gabriel found his wife and mary_jane trying to persuade miss ivors to stay for supper
but miss ivors who had put on her hat and was buttoning her cloak would not stay she did not feel in the least hungry and she had already overstayed her time
but only for ten minute molly said mrs_conroy that wont delay you to take a pick itself said mary_jane after all your dancing
i really couldnt said miss ivors i am afraid you didnt enjoy yourself at all said mary_jane hopelessly
ever so much i assure you said miss ivors but you really must let me run off now
gabriel hesitated a moment and said if you will allow me miss ivors i ll see you home if you are really obliged to go
but how can you get home asked mrs_conroy it only two step up the quay but miss ivors broke away from them
i wont hear of it she cried for goodness sake go in to your supper and dont mind me
i quite well able to take care of myself well you re the comical girl molly said mrs_conroy frankly
mary_jane gazed after her a moody puzzled expression on her face while mrs_conroy leaned over the banisters to listen for the hall door
beannacht libh cried miss ivors with a laugh as she ran down the staircase gabriel asked himself was he the cause of her abrupt departure
but she did not seem to be in ill humour she had gone away laughing he stared blankly down the staircase
at the moment aunt miss_kate came toddling out of the supper room almost wringing her hand in despair where is gabriel
she cried where on earth is gabriel there everyone waiting in there stage to let and nobody to carve the goose
here i am aunt miss_kate cried gabriel with sudden animation ready to carve a flock of geese if necessary
a fat brown goose lay at one end of the table and at the other end on a bed of creased paper strewn with sprigs of parsley lay a great ham stripped of its outer skin and peppered over with crust crumbs a neat paper frill round its shin and beside this was a round of spiced beef
between these rival end ran parallel lines of side dishes two little minsters of jelly red and yellow a shallow dish full of blocks of blancmange and red jam a large green leaf shaped dish with a stalk shaped handle on which lay bunches of purple raisins and peeled almonds a companion dish on which lay a solid rectangle of smyrna figs a dish of custard topped with grated nutmeg a small bowl full of chocolates and sweets wrapped in gold and silver paper and a glass vase in which stood some tall celery stalks
in the centre of the table there stood as sentries to a fruit stand which upheld a pyramid of oranges and american apples two squat old fashioned decanters of cut glass one containing port and the other dark sherry
on the closed square piano a pudding in a huge yellow dish lay in waiting and behind it were three squads of bottle of stout and ale and minerals drawn up according to the colours of their uniforms the first two black with brown and red labels the third and smallest squad white with transverse green sashes
gabriel took his seat boldly at the head of the table and having looked to the edge of the carver plunged his fork firmly into the goose
he felt quite at ease now for he was an expert carver and liked nothing better than to find himself at the head of a well laden table
miss furlong what shall i send you he asked a wing or a slice of the breast
while gabriel and miss daly exchanged plate of goose and plate of ham and spiced beef lily went from guest to guest with a dish of hot floury potatoes wrapped in a white napkin
just a small slice of the breast miss higgins what for you anything at all mr conroy this was mary_jane idea and she had also suggested apple sauce for the goose
but aunt miss_kate had said that plain roast goose without any apple sauce had always been good enough for her and she hoped she might never eat worse
mary_jane waited on her pupils and saw that they got the best slices and aunt miss_kate and aunt miss_julia opened and carried across from the piano bottle of stout and ale for the gentleman and bottle of minerals for the lady
there was a great deal of confusion and laughter and noise the noise of order and counter order of knives and forks of corks and glass stoppers
everyone protested loudly so that he compromised by taking a long draught of stout for he had found the carving hot work
mary_jane settled down quietly to her supper but aunt miss_kate and aunt miss_julia were still toddling round the table walking on each other heels getting in each other way and giving each other unheeded order
gabriel began to carve second helpings as soon as he had finished the first round without serving himself mr_browne begged of them to sit down and eat their supper and so did gabriel
but they said there was time enough so that at last freddy_malins stood up and capturing aunt miss_kate plumped her down on her chair amid general laughter
when everyone had been well served gabriel said smiling now if anyone wants a little more of what vulgar people call stuffing
a chorus of voice invited him to begin his own supper and lily came forward with three potatoes which she had reserved for him
very well said gabriel amiably as he took another preparatory draught kindly forget my existence lady and gentleman for a few minute
he set to his supper and took no part in the conversation with which the table covered lily removal of the plate
let him or her speak the subject of talk was the opera company which was then at the theatre royal
mr bartell arcy the tenor a dark complexioned young man with a smart moustache praised very highly the leading contralto of the company but miss furlong thought she had a rather vulgar style of production
freddy_malins said there was a negro chieftain singing in the second part of the gaiety pantomime who had one of the finest tenor voice he had ever heard
have you heard him he asked mr bartell arcy across the table no answered mr bartell arcy carelessly
because freddy_malins explained now i be curious to hear your opinion of him i think he has a grand voice
it takes teddy to find out the really good thing said mr_browne familiarly to the table and why couldnt he have a voice too
asked freddy_malins sharply is it because he only a black nobody answered this question and mary_jane led the table back to the legitimate opera
one of her pupils had given her a pass for mignon of course it was very fine she said but it made her think of poor georgina burns
mr_browne could go back farther still to the old italian company that used to come to dublin tietjens ilma de murzka campanini the great trebelli giuglini ravelli aramburo
he told too of how the top gallery of the old royal used to be packed night after night of how one night an italian tenor had sung five encores to let me like a soldier fall introducing a high every time and of how the gallery boy would sometimes in their enthusiasm unyoke the horses from the carriage of some great prima donna and pull her themselves through the street to her hotel
those were the day he said when there was something like singing to be heard in dublin why did they never play the grand old operas now he asked dinorah lucrezia borgia
because they could not get the voice to sing them that was why oh well said mr bartell arcy i presume there are as good singers today as there were then
where are they asked mr_browne defiantly in london paris milan said mr bartell arcy warmly i suppose caruso for example is quite as good if not better than any of the man you have mentioned
maybe so said mr_browne but i may tell you i doubt it strongly i give anything to hear caruso sing said mary_jane
for me said aunt miss_kate who had been picking a bone there was only one tenor to please me i mean
but i suppose none of you ever heard of him who was he miss_morkan asked mr bartell arcy politely
his name said aunt miss_kate was parkinson i heard him when he was in his prime and i think he had then the purest tenor voice that was ever put into a man throat
strange said mr bartell arcy i never even heard of him yes yes miss_morkan is right said mr_browne
i remember hearing of old parkinson but he too far back for me a beautiful pure sweet mellow english tenor said aunt miss_kate with enthusiasm
gabriel having finished the huge pudding was transferred to the table the clatter of forks and spoons began again gabriel wife served out spoonfuls of the pudding and passed the plate down the table
midway down they were held up by mary_jane who replenished them with raspberry or orange jelly or with blancmange and jam
the pudding was of aunt miss_julia making and she received praises for it from all quarters she herself said that it was not quite brown enough
well i hope miss_morkan said mr_browne that i brown enough for you because you know i all brown
all the gentleman except gabriel ate some of the pudding out of compliment to aunt miss_julia as gabriel never ate sweets the celery had been left for him
freddy_malins also took a stalk of celery and ate it with his pudding he had been told that celery was a capital thing for the blood
mrs freddy_malins who had been silent all through the supper said that her son was going down to mount melleray in a week or so
the table then spoke of mount melleray how bracing the air was down there how hospitable the monks were and how they never asked for a penny piece from their guests
and do you mean to say asked mr_browne incredulously that a chap can go down there and put up there as if it were a hotel and live on the fat of the land and then come away without paying anything
and he was just then under doctor care most people give some donation to the monastery when they leave said mary_jane
he was astonished to hear that the monks never spoke got up at two in the morning and slept in their coffins
i wish we had an institution like that in our church said mr_browne candidly he asked what they did it for
that the rule of the order said aunt miss_kate firmly yes but why asked mr_browne aunt miss_kate repeated that it was the rule that was all
freddy_malins explained to him as best he could that the monks were trying to make up for the sins committed by all the sinners in the outside world
the explanation was not very clear for mr_browne grinned and said i like that idea very much but wouldnt a comfortable spring bed do them as well as a coffin
mr_browne still seemed not to understand the coffin said mary_jane is to remind them of their last end
as the subject had grown lugubrious it was buried in a silence of the table during which mrs freddy_malins could be heard saying to her neighbour in an indistinct undertone
the raisins and almonds and figs and apples and oranges and chocolates and sweets were now passed about the table and aunt miss_julia invited all the guests to have either port or sherry
at first mr bartell arcy refused to take either but one of his neighbours nudged him and whispered something to him upon which he allowed his glass to be filled
they are very good man the monks very pious man gradually as the last glass were being filled the conversation ceased
a pause followed broken only by the noise of the wine and by unsettlings of chair the misses miss_morkan all three looked down at the tablecloth
someone coughed once or twice and then a few gentleman patted the table gently as a signal for silence the silence came and gabriel pushed back his chair
the patting at once grew louder in encouragement and then ceased altogether gabriel leaned his ten trembling finger on the tablecloth and smiled nervously at the company
meeting a row of upturned face he raised his eye to the chandelier the piano was playing a waltz tune and he could hear the skirts sweeping against the drawing room door
people perhaps were standing in the snow on the quay outside gazing up at the lighted window and listening to the waltz music
the air was pure there in the distance lay the park where the trees were weighted with snow the wellington monument wore a gleaming cap of snow that flashed westward over the white field of fifteen acres
he began lady and gentleman it has fallen to my lot this evening as in year past to perform a very pleasing task but a task for which i am afraid my poor powers as a speaker are all too inadequate
but however that may be i can only ask you tonight to take the will for the deed and to lend me your attention for a few moment while i endeavour to express to you in word what my feelings are on this occasion
lady and gentleman it is not the first time that we have gathered together under this hospitable roof around this hospitable board
it is not the first time that we have been the recipients or perhaps i had better say the victims of the hospitality of certain good lady
no no said mr_browne he made a circle in the air with his arm and paused everyone laughed or smiled at aunt miss_kate and aunt miss_julia and mary_jane who all turned crimson with pleasure
gabriel went on more boldly i feel more strongly with every recurring year that our country has no tradition which does it so much honour and which it should guard so jealously as that of its hospitality
it is a tradition that is unique as far as my experience goes and i have visited not a few place abroad among the modern nations
but granted even that it is to my mind a princely failing and one that i trust will long be cultivated among us
some would say perhaps that with us it is rather a failing than anything to be boasted of of one thing at least i am sure
as long as this one roof shelters the good lady aforesaid and i wish from my heart it may do so for many and many a long year to come the tradition of genuine warm hearted courteous irish hospitality which our forefathers have handed down to us and which we in turn must hand down to our descendants is still alive among us
it shot through gabriel mind that miss ivors was not there and that she had gone away discourteously and he said with confidence in himself lady and gentleman a new generation is growing up in our midst a generation actuated by new idea and new principles
it is serious and enthusiastic for these new idea and its enthusiasm even when it is misdirected is i believe in the main sincere
but we are living in a sceptical and if i may use the phrase a thought tormented age and sometimes i fear that this new generation educated or hypereducated as it is will lack those qualities of humanity of hospitality of kindly humour which belonged to an older day
listening tonight to the name of all those great singers of the past it seemed to me i must confess that we were living in a less spacious age
those day might without exaggeration be called spacious day and if they are gone beyond recall let us hope at least that in gatherings such as this we shall still speak of them with pride and affection still cherish in our heart the memory of those dead and gone great one whose fame the world will not willingly let die
but yet continued gabriel his voice falling into a softer inflection there are always in gatherings such as this sadder thought that will recur to our mind thought of the past of youth of changes of absent face that we miss here tonight
our path through life is strewn with many such sad memory and were we to brood upon them always we could not find the heart to go on bravely with our work among the living
a hearty murmur of assent ran round the table hear hear said mr_browne loudly we have all of us living duties and living affections which claim and rightly claim our strenuous endeavours
therefore i will not linger on the past i will not let any gloomy moralising intrude upon us here tonight
we are met here as friend in the spirit of good fellowship as colleagues also to a certain extent in the true spirit of camaraderie and as the guests of what shall i call them the three graces of the dublin musical world
here we are gathered together for a brief moment from the bustle and rush of our everyday routine the table burst into applause and laughter at this allusion
aunt miss_julia vainly asked each of her neighbours in turn to tell her what gabriel had said he says we are the three graces aunt miss_julia said mary_jane
aunt miss_julia did not understand but she looked up smiling at gabriel who continued in the same vein lady and gentleman i will not attempt to play tonight the part that paris played on another occasion
i will not attempt to choose between them the task would be an invidious one and one beyond my poor powers
for when i view them in turn whether it be our chief hostess herself whose good heart whose too good heart has become a byword with all who know her or her sister who seems to be gifted with perennial youth and whose singing must have been a surprise and a revelation to us all tonight or last but not least when i consider our youngest hostess talented cheerful hard working and the best of nieces i confess lady and gentleman that i do not know to which of them i should award the prize
gabriel glanced down at his aunt and seeing the large smile on aunt miss_julia face and the tears which had risen to aunt miss_kate eye hastened to his close
he raised his glass of port gallantly while every member of the company fingered a glass expectantly and said loudly let us toast them all three together
let us drink to their health wealth long life happiness and prosperity and may they long continue to hold the proud and self won position which they hold in their profession and the position of honour and affection which they hold in our heart
all the guests stood up glass in hand and turning towards the three seated lady sang in unison with mr_browne as leader
for they are jolly gay fellow for they are jolly gay fellow for they are jolly gay fellow which nobody can deny
freddy_malins beat time with his pudding fork and the singers turned towards one another as if in melodious conference while they sang with emphasis unless he tells a lie unless he tells a lie
aunt miss_kate was making frank use of her handkerchief and even aunt miss_julia seemed moved then turning once more towards their hostesses they sang
for they are jolly gay fellow for they are jolly gay fellow for they are jolly gay fellow which nobody can deny
the acclamation which followed was taken up beyond the door of the supper room by many of the other guests and renewed time after time freddy_malins acting as officer with his fork on high
the piercing morning air came into the hall where they were standing so that aunt miss_kate said close the door somebody
mrs freddy_malins will get her death of cold mr_browne is out there aunt miss_kate said mary_jane mr_browne is everywhere said aunt miss_kate lowering her voice
mary_jane laughed at her tone really she said archly he is very attentive he has been laid on here like the gas said aunt miss_kate in the same tone all during the christmas
she laughed herself this time good humouredly and then added quickly but tell him to come in mary_jane and close the door
at that moment the hall door was opened and mr_browne came in from the doorstep laughing as if his heart would break
he was dressed in a long green overcoat with mock astrakhan cuffs and collar and wore on his head an oval fur cap
i hope to goodness he didnt hear me he pointed down the snow covered quay from where the sound of shrill prolonged whistling was borne in
gabriel advanced from the little pantry behind the office struggling into his overcoat and looking round the hall said gretta not down yet
teddy will have all the cabs in dublin out he said she getting on her thing gabriel said aunt miss_kate
who playing up there asked gabriel nobody they re all gone no aunt miss_kate said mary_jane
mary_jane glanced at gabriel and mr_browne and said with a shiver it makes me feel cold to look at you two gentleman muffled up like that
bartell arcy and miss callaghan arent gone yet someone is fooling at the piano anyhow said gabriel i wouldnt like to face your journey home at this hour
i like nothing better this minute said mr_browne stoutly than a rattling fine walk in the country or a fast drive with a good spanking goer between the shafts
we used to have a very good horse and trap at home said aunt miss_julia sadly the never to be forgotten johnny said mary_jane laughing
the late lamented patrick miss_morkan our grandfather that is explained gabriel commonly known in his later year as the old gentleman was a glue boiler
aunt miss_kate and gabriel laughed too why what was wonderful about johnny asked mr_browne now gabriel said aunt miss_kate laughing he had a starch mill
well glue or starch said gabriel the old gentleman had a horse by the name of johnny and johnny used to work in the old gentleman mill walking round and round in order to drive the mill
one fine day the old gentleman thought he like to drive out with the quality to a military review in the park
that was all very well but now comes the tragic part about johnny the lord have mercy on his soul said aunt miss_kate compassionately
so the old gentleman as i said harnessed johnny and put on his very best tall hat and his very best stock collar and drove out in grand style from his ancestral mansion somewhere near back lane i think
everyone laughed even mrs freddy_malins at gabriel manner and aunt miss_kate said now gabriel he didnt live in back lane really
amen said gabriel only the mill was there out from the mansion of his forefathers continued gabriel he drove with johnny
and everything went on beautifully until johnny came in sight of king billy statue and whether he fell in love with the horse
king billy sits on or whether he thought he was back again in the mill anyhow he began to walk round the statue
round and round he went said gabriel and the old gentleman who was a very pompous old gentleman was highly indignant
gabriel paced in a circle round the hall in his goloshes amid the laughter of the other go on sir
the peal of laughter which followed gabriel imitation of the incident was interrupted by a resounding knock at the hall door
what do you mean sir johnny johnny most extraordinary conduct cant understand the horse mary_jane ran to open it and let in freddy_malins
freddy_malins with his hat well back on his head and his shoulder humped with cold was puffing and steaming after his exertions
i could only get one cab he said we ll find another along the quay said gabriel yes said aunt miss_kate
mrs freddy_malins was helped down the front step by her son and mr_browne and after many manoeuvres hoisted into the cab
freddy_malins clambered in after her and spent a long time settling her on the seat mr_browne helping him with advice
better not keep mrs freddy_malins standing in the draught at last she was settled comfortably and freddy_malins invited mr_browne into the cab
there was a good deal of confused talk and then mr_browne got into the cab the cabman settled his rug over his knees and bent down for the address
the confusion grew greater and the cabman was directed differently by freddy_malins and mr_browne each of whom had his head out through a window of the cab
the difficulty was to know where to drop mr_browne along the route and aunt miss_kate aunt miss_julia and mary_jane helped the discussion from the doorstep with cross directions and contradictions and abundance of laughter
he popped his head in and out of the window every moment to the great danger of his hat and told his mother how the discussion was progressing till at last mr_browne shouted to the bewildered cabman above the din of everybody laughter do you know trinity college
as for freddy_malins he was speechless with laughter yes sir said the cabman well drive bang up against trinity college gates said mr_browne and then we ll tell you where to go
you understand now yes sir said the cabman make like a bird for trinity college right sir said the cabman
the horse was whipped up and the cab rattled off along the quay amid a chorus of laughter and adieus gabriel had not gone to the door with the other
he was in a dark part of the hall gazing up the staircase a woman was standing near the top of the first flight in the shadow also
he could not see her face but he could see the terra cotta and salmon pink panels of her skirt which the shadow made appear black and white
it was his wife she was leaning on the banisters listening to something gabriel was surprised at her stillness and strained his ear to listen also
but he could hear little save the noise of laughter and dispute on the front step a few chords struck on the piano and a few note of a man voice singing
he stood still in the gloom of the hall trying to catch the air that the voice was singing and gazing up at his wife
he asked himself what is a woman standing on the stair in the shadow listening to distant music a symbol of
there was grace and mystery in her attitude as if she were a symbol of something if he were a painter he would paint her in that attitude
her blue felt hat would show off the bronze of her hair against the darkness and the dark panels of her skirt would show off the light one
distant music he would call the picture if he were a painter the hall door was closed and aunt miss_kate aunt miss_julia and mary_jane came down the hall still laughing
well isnt freddy_malins terrible said mary_jane he really terrible gabriel said nothing but pointed up the stair towards where his wife was standing
now that the hall door was closed the voice and the piano could be heard more clearly gabriel held up his hand for them to be silent
the song seemed to be in the old irish tonality and the singer seemed uncertain both of his word and of his voice
the voice made plaintive by distance and by the singer hoarseness faintly illuminated the cadence of the air with word expressing grief the rain falls on my heavy locks
and the dew wets my skin my babe lies cold exclaimed mary_jane it bartell arcy singing and he wouldnt sing all the night
mary_jane brushed past the other and ran to the staircase but before she reached it the singing stopped and the piano was closed abruptly
o i ll get him to sing a song before he goes do mary_jane said aunt miss_kate what a pity
she cried is he coming down gretta gabriel heard his wife answer yes and saw her come down towards them
o mr arcy cried mary_jane it downright mean of you to break off like that when we were all in raptures listening to you
i have been at him all the evening said miss callaghan and mrs_conroy too and he told us he had a dreadful cold and couldnt sing
a few step behind her were mr bartell arcy and miss callaghan mr arcy said aunt miss_kate now that was a great fib to tell
cant you see that i as hoarse as a crow said mr arcy roughly he went into the pantry hastily and put on his overcoat
the other taken aback by his rude speech could find nothing to say aunt miss_kate wrinkled her brows and made signs to the other to drop the subject
mr arcy stood swathing his neck carefully and frowning it the weather said aunt miss_julia after a pause yes everybody has colds said aunt miss_kate readily everybody
they say said mary_jane we havent had snow like it for thirty year and i read this morning in the newspapers that the snow is general all over ireland
i love the look of snow said aunt miss_julia sadly so do i said miss callaghan
i think christmas is never really christmas unless we have the snow on the ground but poor mr arcy doesnt like the snow said aunt miss_kate smiling
mr arcy came from the pantry fully swathed and buttoned and in a repentant tone told them the history of his cold
everyone gave him advice and said it was a great pity and urged him to be very careful of his throat in the night air
she was standing right under the dusty fanlight and the flame of the gas lit up the rich bronze of her hair which he had seen her drying at the fire a few day before
gabriel watched his wife who did not join in the conversation she was in the same attitude and seemed unaware of the talk about her
at last she turned towards them and gabriel saw that there was colour on her cheeks and that her eye were shining
a sudden tide of joy went leaping out of his heart mr arcy she said what is the name of that song you were singing
it called the lass of aughrim said mr arcy but i couldnt remember it properly why do you know it
the lass of aughrim she repeated i couldnt think of the name it a very nice air said mary_jane
i sorry you were not in voice tonight now mary_jane said aunt miss_kate dont annoy mr arcy i wont have him annoyed
seeing that all were ready to start she shepherded them to the door where good night was said well good night aunt miss_kate and thanks for the pleasant evening
good night gabriel good night gretta good night aunt miss_kate and thanks ever so much goodnight aunt miss_julia good night gretta i didnt see you
good night mr arcy good night miss callaghan good night miss_morkan good night again good night all safe home good night
good night the morning was still dark a dull yellow light brooded over the house and the river and the sky seemed to be descending
it was slushy underfoot and only streaks and patches of snow lay on the roofs on the parapets of the quay and on the area railings
the lamp were still burning redly in the murky air and across the river the palace of the four courts stood out menacingly against the heavy sky
she was walking on before him with mr bartell arcy her shoes in a brown parcel tucked under one arm and her hand holding her skirt up from the slush
she had no longer any grace of attitude but gabriel eye were still bright with happiness the blood went bounding along his veins and the thought went rioting through his brain proud joyful tender valorous
she was walking on before him so lightly and so erect that he longed to run after her noiselessly catch her by the shoulder and say something foolish and affectionate into her ear
she seemed to him so frail that he longed to defend her against something and then to be alone with her
moment of their secret life together burst like stars upon his memory a heliotrope envelope was lying beside his breakfast cup and he was caressing it with his hand
birds were twittering in the ivy and the sunny web of the curtain was shimmering along the floor he could not eat for happiness
he was standing with her in the cold looking in through a grated window at a man making bottle in a roaring furnace
they were standing on the crowded platform and he was placing a ticket inside the warm palm of her glove it was very cold
her face fragrant in the cold air was quite close to his and suddenly he called out to the man at the furnace
is the fire hot sir but the man could not hear with the noise of the furnace it was just as well
he might have answered rudely a wave of yet more tender joy escaped from his heart and went coursing in warm flood along his arteries
like the tender fire of stars moment of their life together that no one knew of or would ever know of broke upon and illumined his memory
he longed to recall to her those moment to make her forget the year of their dull existence together and remember only their moment of ecstasy
for the year he felt had not quenched his soul or hers their child his writing her household cares had not quenched all their soul tender fire
in one letter that he had written to her then he had said why is it that word like these seem to me so dull and cold
is it because there is no word tender enough to be your name like distant music these word that he had written year before were borne towards him from the past
when the other had gone away when he and she were in the room in their hotel then they would be alone together
he longed to be alone with her he would call her softly gretta perhaps she would not hear at once she would be undressing
then something in his voice would strike her she would turn and look at him at the corner of winetavern street they met a cab
he was glad of its rattling noise as it saved him from conversation she was looking out of the window and seemed tired
the horse galloped along wearily under the murky morning sky dragging his old rattling box after his heels and gabriel was again in a cab with her galloping to catch the boat galloping to their honeymoon
as the cab drove across connell bridge miss callaghan said they say you never cross connell bridge without seeing a white horse
the other spoke only a few word pointing out some building or street i see a white man this time said gabriel
where asked mr bartell arcy gabriel pointed to the statue on which lay patches of snow then he nodded familiarly to it and waved his hand
when the cab drew up before the hotel gabriel jumped out and in spite of mr bartell arcy protest paid the driver
good night dan he said gaily he gave the man a shilling over his fare the man saluted and said a prosperous new year to you sir
she leaned for a moment on his arm in getting out of the cab and while standing at the curbstone bidding the other good night
the same to you said gabriel cordially she leaned lightly on his arm as lightly as when she had danced with him a few hour before
but now after the kindling again of so many memory the first touch of her body musical and strange and perfumed sent through him a keen pang of lust
under cover of her silence he pressed her arm closely to his side and as they stood at the hotel door he felt that they had escaped from their life and duties escaped from home and friend and run away together with wild and radiant heart to a new adventure
he had felt proud and happy then happy that she was his proud of her grace and wifely carriage an old man was dozing in a great hooded chair in the hall
he lit a candle in the office and went before them to the stair they followed him in silence their foot falling in soft thuds on the thickly carpeted stair
she mounted the stair behind the porter her head bowed in the ascent her frail shoulder curved as with a burden her skirt girt tightly about her
he could have flung his arm about her hips and held her still for his arm were trembling with desire to seize her and only the stress of his nails against the palms of his hand held the wild impulse of his body in check
in the silence gabriel could hear the falling of the molten wax into the tray and the thumping of his own heart against his ribs
the porter halted on the stair to settle his guttering candle they halted too on the step below him the porter led them along a corridor and opened a door
then he set his unstable candle down on a toilet table and asked at what hour they were to be called in the morning
eight said gabriel the porter pointed to the tap of the electric light and began a muttered apology but gabriel cut him short
we dont want any light we have light enough from the street and i say he added pointing to the candle you might remove that handsome article like a good man
the porter took up his candle again but slowly for he was surprised by such a novel idea then he mumbled good night and went out
gabriel shot the lock to a ghostly light from the street lamp lay in a long shaft from one window to the door
gabriel threw his overcoat and hat on a couch and crossed the room towards the window he looked down into the street in order that his emotion might calm a little
then he turned and leaned against a chest of drawers with his back to the light she had taken off her hat and cloak and was standing before a large swinging mirror unhooking her waist
gabriel paused for a few moment watching her and then said gretta she turned away from the mirror slowly and walked along the shaft of light towards him
her face looked so serious and weary that the word would not pass gabriel lip no it was not the moment yet
you looked tired he said i am a little she answered you dont feel ill or weak no tired that all
she went on to the window and stood there looking out gabriel waited again and then fearing that diffidence was about to conquer him he said abruptly by the way gretta
what is it you know that poor fellow freddy_malins he said quickly yes what about him well poor fellow he a decent sort of chap after all continued gabriel in a false voice
he gave me back that sovereign i lent him and i didnt expect it really it a pity he wouldnt keep away from that mr_browne because he not a bad fellow really
he was trembling now with annoyance why did she seem so abstracted he did not know how he could begin
was she annoyed too about something if she would only turn to him or come to him of her own accord
to take her as she was would be brutal no he must see some ardour in her eye first he longed to be master of her strange mood
when did you lend him the pound she asked after a pause gabriel strove to restrain himself from breaking out into brutal language about the sottish freddy_malins and his pound
he longed to cry to her from his soul to crush her body against his to overmaster her but he said at christmas when he opened that little christmas card shop in henry street
he was in such a fever of rage and desire that he did not hear her come from the window
she stood before him for an instant looking at him strangely then suddenly raising herself on tiptoe and resting her hand lightly on his shoulder she kissed him
gabriel trembling with delight at her sudden kiss and at the quaintness of her phrase put his hand on her hair and began smoothing it back scarcely touching it with his finger
you are a very generous person gabriel she said the washing had made it fine and brilliant his heart was brimming over with happiness
just when he was wishing for it she had come to him of her own accord perhaps her thought had been running with his
perhaps she had felt the impetuous desire that was in him and then the yielding mood had come upon her now that she had fallen to him so easily he wondered why he had been so diffident
then slipping one arm swiftly about her body and drawing her towards him he said softly gretta dear what are you thinking about
he stood holding her head between his hand she did not answer nor yield wholly to his arm he said again softly tell me what it is gretta
i think i know what is the matter do i know she did not answer at once then she said in an outburst of tears i am thinking about that song the lass of aughrim
she broke loose from him and ran to the bed and throwing her arm across the bed rail hid her face
as he passed in the way of the cheval glass he caught sight of himself in full length his broad well filled shirt front the face whose expression always puzzled him when he saw it in a mirror and his glimmering gilt rimmed eyeglasses
gabriel stood stock still for a moment in astonishment and then followed her he halted a few paces from her and said what about the song
why does that make you cry she raised her head from her arm and dried her eye with the back of her hand like a child
a kinder note than he had intended went into his voice why gretta he asked i am thinking about a person long ago who used to sing that song
and who was the person long ago asked gabriel smiling it was a person i used to know in galway when i was living with my grandmother she said
a dull anger began to gather again at the back of his mind and the dull fire of his lust began to glow angrily in his veins
the smile passed away from gabriel face someone you were in love with he asked ironically it was a young boy i used to know she answered named michael furey
he used to sing that song the lass of aughrim he was very delicate gabriel was silent he did not wish her to think that he was interested in this delicate boy
i can see him so plainly she said after a moment such eye as he had big dark eye
and such an expression in them an expression then you are in love with him said gabriel i used to go out walking with him she said when i was in galway
a thought flew across gabriel mind perhaps that was why you wanted to go to galway with that ivors girl
he said coldly she looked at him and asked in surprise what for her eye made gabriel feel awkward he shrugged his shoulder and said how do i know
to see him perhaps she looked away from him along the shaft of light towards the window in silence
he is dead she said at length he died when he was only seventeen isnt it a terrible thing to die so young as that
gabriel felt humiliated by the failure of his irony and by the evocation of this figure from the dead a boy in the gasworks
while he had been full of memory of their secret life together full of tenderness and joy and desire she had been comparing him in her mind with another
what was he asked gabriel still ironically he was in the gasworks she said a shameful consciousness of his own person assailed him
he saw himself as a ludicrous figure acting as a pennyboy for his aunt a nervous well meaning sentimentalist orating to vulgarians and idealising his own clownish lusts the pitiable fatuous fellow he had caught a glimpse of in the mirror
instinctively he turned his back more to the light lest she might see the shame that burned upon his forehead he tried to keep up his tone of cold interrogation but his voice when he spoke was humble and indifferent
i suppose you were in love with this michael furey gretta he said i was great with him at that time she said
gabriel feeling now how vain it would be to try to lead her whither he had purposed caressed one of her hand and said also sadly
her voice was veiled and sad and what did he die of so young gretta consumption was it i think he died for me she answered
a vague terror seized gabriel at this answer as if at that hour when he had hoped to triumph some impalpable and vindictive being was coming against him gathering forces against him in its vague world
but he shook himself free of it with an effort of reason and continued to caress her hand he did not question her again for he felt that she would tell him of herself
her hand was warm and moist it did not respond to his touch but he continued to caress it just as he had caressed her first letter to him that spring morning
it was in the winter she said about the beginning of the winter when i was going to leave my grandmother and come up here to the convent
and he was ill at the time in his lodgings in galway and wouldnt be let out and his people in oughterard were written to
he was in decline they said or something like that i never knew rightly she paused for a moment and sighed
poor fellow she said he was very fond of me and he was such a gentle boy we used to go out together walking you know gabriel like the way they do in the country
he was going to study singing only for his health he had a very good voice poor michael furey well and then asked gabriel
and then when it came to the time for me to leave galway and come up to the convent he was much worse
so i wrote him a letter saying i was going up to dublin and would be back in the summer and hoping he would be better then
and i wouldnt be let see him she paused for a moment to get her voice under control and then went on
then the night before i left i was in my grandmother house in nuns island packing up and i heard gravel thrown up against the window
the window was so wet i couldnt see so i ran downstairs as i was and slipped out the back into the garden
and there was the poor fellow at the end of the garden shivering and did you not tell him to go back asked gabriel
i implored of him to go home at once and told him he would get his death in the rain
but he said he did not want to live i can see his eye as well as well he was standing at the end of the wall where there was a tree
and when i was only a week in the convent he died and he was buried in oughterard where his people came from
and did he go home asked gabriel yes he went home the day i heard that that he was dead
gabriel held her hand for a moment longer irresolutely and then shy of intruding on her grief let it fall gently and walked quietly to the window
she stopped choking with sobs and overcome by emotion flung herself face downward on the bed sobbing in the quilt she was fast asleep
gabriel leaning on his elbow looked for a few moment unresentfully on her tangled hair and half open mouth listening to her deep drawn breath
so she had had that romance in her life a man had died for her sake it hardly pained him now to think how poor a part he her husband had played in her life
his curious eye rested long upon her face and on her hair and as he thought of what she must have been then in that time of her first girlish beauty a strange friendly pity for her entered his soul
he did not like to say even to himself that her face was no longer beautiful but he knew that it was no longer the face for which michael furey had braved death
he watched her while she slept as though he and she had never lived together as man and wife perhaps she had not told him all the story
his eye moved to the chair over which she had thrown some of her clothes a petticoat string dangled to the floor
one boot stood upright its limp upper fallen down the fellow of it lay upon its side he wondered at his riot of emotions of an hour before
from his aunt supper from his own foolish speech from the wine and dancing the merry making when saying good night in the hall the pleasure of the walk along the river in the snow
from what had it proceeded poor aunt miss_julia she too would soon be a shade with the shade of patrick miss_morkan and his horse
he had caught that haggard look upon her face for a moment when she was singing arrayed for the bridal soon perhaps he would be sitting in that same drawing room dressed in black his silk hat on his knees
the blinds would be drawn down and aunt miss_kate would be sitting beside him crying and blowing her nose and telling him how miss_julia had died
he would cast about in his mind for some word that might console her and would find only lame and useless one
yes yes that would happen very soon the air of the room chilled his shoulder he stretched himself cautiously along under the sheets and lay down beside his wife
better pass boldly into that other world in the full glory of some passion than fade and wither dismally with age
he thought of how she who lay beside him had locked in her heart for so many year that image of her lover eye when he had told her that he did not wish to live
one by one they were all becoming shades generous tears filled gabriel eye he had never felt like that himself towards any woman but he knew that such a feeling must be love
the tears gathered more thickly in his eye and in the partial darkness he imagined he saw the form of a young man standing under a dripping tree
other forms were near his soul had approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead he was conscious of but could not apprehend their wayward and flickering existence
his own identity was fading out into a grey impalpable world the solid world itself which these dead had one time reared and lived in was dissolving and dwindling
a few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window it had begun to snow again he watched sleepily the flakes silver and dark falling obliquely against the lamplight
the time had come for him to set out on his journey westward yes the newspapers were right snow was general all over ireland
it was falling on every part of the dark central plain on the treeless hills falling softly upon the bog of allen and farther westward softly falling into the dark mutinous shannon waves
it lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones on the spears of the little gate on the barren thorns
his soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling like the descent of their last end upon all the living and the dead
