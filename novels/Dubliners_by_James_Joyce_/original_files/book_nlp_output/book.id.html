<p/>Night after night I had passed the house -LRB-it was vacation time-RRB- and studied the lighted square of window: and night after night I had found it lighted in the same way, faintly and evenly.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) was dead, I thought, I would see the reflection of candles on the darkened blind for I knew that two candles must be set at the head of a corpse.
<p/>THE SISTERS THERE was no hope for him (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) this time: it was the third stroke. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) had often said to me: <div class="bookquote">``I am not long for this world,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and I had thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) words idle.
<p/>Now I knew they were true. Every night as I gazed up at the window I said softly to myself the word paralysis.
<p/>It had always sounded strangely in my ears, like the word gnomon in the Euclid and the word simony in the Catechism.
<p/>It filled me with fear, and yet I longed to be nearer to it and to look upon its deadly work.
<p/>But now it sounded to me like the name of some maleficent and sinful being. Old Cotter was sitting at the fire, smoking, when I came downstairs to supper.
<p/>While my aunt was ladling out my stirabout he (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) said, as if returning to some former remark of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``No, I wouldn't say he (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) was exactly...
<p/>but there was something queer... there was something uncanny about him (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>). I'll tell you my opinion... ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) began to puff at his (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) pipe, no doubt arranging his (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) opinion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) mind.
<p/>When we knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) first he (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) used to be rather interesting, talking of faints and worms; but I soon grew tired of him (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) endless stories about the distillery.
<p/>Tiresome old fool! '' I have my own theory about it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) said. '' I think it was one of those... peculiar cases....
<p/>My uncle saw me staring and said to me: <div class="bookquote">``Well, so your old friend is gone, you'll be sorry to hear.
<p/>But it's hard to say... ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) began to puff again at his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pipe without giving us his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) theory. '' <div class="bookquote">``Who?''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Father Flynn.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Flynn</b></font>) dead?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cotter/Mr. Cotter</b></font>)</div>'' Mr. Cotter here has just told us. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) was passing by the house. '' I knew that I was under observation
<p/>so I continued eating as if the news had not interested me. My uncle explained to old Cotter. '' The youngster and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) were great friends.
<p/>The old chap taught him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) a great deal, mind you; and they say he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) had a great wish for him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>). ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``God have mercy on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said my aunt piously. Old Cotter looked at me for a while. I felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) little beady black eyes were examining me
<p/>but I would not satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) by looking up from my plate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) pipe and finally spat rudely into the grate.
<p/>'' I wouldn't like children of mine,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to have too much to say to a man like that.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean, Mr. Cotter?''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>asked my aunt.
<p/>My idea is: let a young lad run about and play with young lads of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) own age and not be...
<p/>'' What I mean is,'' said old Cotter, <div class="bookquote">``it's bad for children. Am I right, Jack?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cotter/Mr. Cotter</b></font>)</div>'' That's my principle, too,'' said my uncle.
<p/>'' Let him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) learn to box his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) corner. That's what I'm always saying to that Rosicrucian there: take exercise. Why, when I was a nipper every morning of my life I had a cold bath, winter and summer.
<p/>And that's what stands to me now. Education is all very fine and large.... Mr. Cotter might take a pick of that leg mutton,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) added to my aunt.
<p/>'' No, no, not for me,'' said old Cotter. My aunt brought the dish from the safe and put it on the table.
<p/>'' But why do you think it's not good for children, Mr. Cotter? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) asked. '' It's bad for children,'' said old Cotter, <div class="bookquote">``because their minds are so impressionable.
<p/>When children see things like that, you know, it has an effect... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cotter/Mr. Cotter</b></font>)</div>I crammed my mouth with stirabout for fear I might give utterance to my anger.
<p/>Though I was angry with old Cotter for alluding to me as a child, I puzzled my head to extract meaning from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) unfinished sentences.
<p/>Tiresome old red-nosed imbecile! It was late when I fell asleep. In the dark of my room I imagined that I saw again the heavy grey face of the paralytic.
<p/>I drew the blankets over my head and tried to think of Christmas. But the grey face still followed me. It murmured; and I understood that it desired to confess something.
<p/>It began to confess to me in a murmuring voice and I wondered why it smiled continually and why the lips were so moist with spittle.
<p/>I felt my soul receding into some pleasant and vicious region; and there again I found it waiting for me. But then I remembered that it had died of paralysis
<p/>and I felt that I too was smiling feebly as if to absolve the simoniac of his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) sin. The next morning after breakfast I went down to look at the little house in Great Britain Street.
<p/>The drapery consisted mainly of children's bootees and umbrellas; and on ordinary days a notice used to hang in the window, saying: Umbrellas Re-covered.
<p/>It was an unassuming shop, registered under the vague name of Drapery. No notice was visible now for the shutters were up.
<p/>A crape bouquet was tied to the doork-nocker with ribbon. Two poor women and a telegram boy were reading the card pinned on the crape.
<p/>I also approached and read: July 1st, 1895 The Rev. James Flynn -LRB-formerly of S. Catherine's Church, Meath Street-RRB-, aged sixty-five years.
<p/>R. I. P. The reading of the card persuaded me that he (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) was dead and I was disturbed to find myself at check.
<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) not been dead I would have gone into the little dark room behind the shop to find him (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) arm-chair by the fire, nearly smothered in his (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) great-coat.
<p/>Perhaps my aunt would have given me a packet of High Toast for him (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) and this present would have roused him (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) stupefied doze.
<p/>It was always I who emptied the packet into his (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) black snuff-box for his (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) hands trembled too much to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) to do this without spilling half the snuff about the floor.
<p/>Even as he (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) large trembling hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) nose little clouds of smoke dribbled through his (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) fingers over the front of his (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) coat.
<p/>It may have been these constant showers of snuff which gave his (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) ancient priestly garments their green faded look for the red handkerchief, blackened, as it always was, with the snuff-stains of a week, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) tried to brush away the fallen grains, was quite inefficacious.
<p/>I walked away slowly along the sunny side of the street, reading all the theatrical advertisements in the shopwindows as I went.
<p/>I found it strange that neither I nor the day seemed in a mourning mood and I felt even annoyed at discovering in myself a sensation of freedom as if I had been freed from something by his (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) death.
<p/>I wished to go in and look at him (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) but I had not the courage to knock. I wondered at this for, as my uncle had said the night before, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had taught me a great deal.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had told me stories about the catacombs and about Napoleon Bonaparte, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bonaparte</b></font>) had explained to me the meaning of the different ceremonies of the Mass and of the different vestments worn by the priest.
<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) had amused himself by putting difficult questions to me, asking me what one should do in certain circumstances or whether such and such sins were mortal or venial or only imperfections.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) questions showed me how complex and mysterious were certain institutions of the Church which I had always regarded as the simplest acts.
<p/>The duties of the priest towards the Eucharist and towards the secrecy of the confessional seemed so grave to me that I wondered how anybody had ever found in himself the courage to undertake them; and I was not surprised when he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) told me that the fathers of the Church had written books as thick as the Post Office Directory and as closely printed as the law notices in the newspaper, elucidating all these intricate questions.
<p/>Often when I thought of this I could make no answer or only a very foolish and halting one upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) used to smile and nod his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) head twice or thrice.
<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) used to put me through the responses of the Mass which he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) had made me learn by heart; and, as I pattered, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) used to smile pensively and nod his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) head, now and then pushing huge pinches of snuff up each nostril alternately.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) smiled he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) used to uncover his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) big discoloured teeth and let his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) tongue lie upon his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) lower lip--a habit which had made me feel uneasy in the beginning of our acquaintance before I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) well.
<p/>As I walked along in the sun I remembered old Cotter's words and tried to remember what had happened afterwards in the dream.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) had studied in the Irish college in Rome and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cotter</b></font>) had taught me to pronounce Latin properly. I remembered that I had noticed long velvet curtains and a swinging lamp of antique fashion.
<p/>I felt that I had been very far away, in some land where the customs were strange--in Persia, I thought.... But I could not remember the end of the dream.
<p/>It was after sunset; but the window-panes of the houses that looked to the west reflected the tawny gold of a great bank of clouds.
<p/>Nannie received us in the hall; and, as it would have been unseemly to have shouted at her (<font color='blue'><b>Nannie</b></font>), my aunt shook hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) for all.
<p/>The old woman pointed upwards interrogatively and, on my aunt's nodding, proceeded to toil up the narrow staircase before us, her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) bowed head being scarcely above the level of the banister-rail.
<p/>In the evening my aunt took me with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to visit the house of mourning. At the first landing she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) stopped and beckoned us forward encouragingly towards the open door of the dead-room.
<p/>My aunt went in and the old woman, seeing that I hesitated to enter, began to beckon to me again repeatedly with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand.
<p/>The room through the lace end of the blind was suffused with dusky golden light amid which the candles looked like pale thin flames.
<p/>I went in on tiptoe. He (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had been coffined. Nannie gave the lead and we three knelt down at the foot of the bed.
<p/>I pretended to pray but I could not gather my thoughts because the old woman's mutterings distracted me. I noticed how clumsily her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) skirt was hooked at the back and
<p/>how the heels of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cloth boots were trodden down all to one side. The fancy came to me that the old priest was smiling as he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) lay there in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) coffin.
<p/>But no. When we rose and went up to the head of the bed I saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was not smiling.
<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) lay, solemn and copious, vested as for the altar, his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) large hands loosely retaining a chalice. His (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) face was very truculent, grey and massive, with black cavernous nostrils and circled by a scanty white fur.
<p/>There was a heavy odour in the room--the flowers. We blessed ourselves and came away. In the little room downstairs we found Eliza seated in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) arm-chair in state.
<p/>I groped my way towards my usual chair in the corner while Nannie went to the sideboard and brought out a decanter of sherry and some wine-glasses.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nannie</b></font>) set these on the table and invited us to take a little glass of wine. Then, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Nannie</b></font>) sister's bidding, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nannie</b></font>) filled out the sherry into the glasses and passed them to us.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nannie</b></font>) pressed me to take some cream crackers also but I declined because I thought I would make too much noise eating them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Nannie</b></font>) seemed to be somewhat disappointed at my refusal and went over quietly to the sofa where she (<font color='blue'><b>Nannie</b></font>) sat down behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Nannie</b></font>) sister.
<p/>No one spoke: we all gazed at the empty fireplace. My aunt waited until Eliza sighed and then said: <div class="bookquote">``Ah, well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>)'s gone to a better world.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza</b></font>)</div>Eliza sighed again and bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) head in assent. My aunt fingered the stem of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) wine-glass before sipping a little.
<p/>'' Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>)... peacefully? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) asked. '' Oh, quite peacefully, ma'am,'' said Eliza. '' You couldn't tell when the breath went out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had a beautiful death, God be praised.'' '' And everything...?'' <div class="bookquote">``Father O'Rourke was in with him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Rourke</b></font>) a Tuesday and anointed him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Rourke</b></font>) and prepared him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Rourke</b></font>) and all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Rourke</b></font>) knew then?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Rourke</b></font>) was quite resigned. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Rourke</b></font>) looks quite resigned,'' said my aunt. '' That's what the woman we had in to wash him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Rourke</b></font>) said.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Rourke</b></font>) just looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Rourke</b></font>) was asleep, he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Rourke</b></font>) looked that peaceful and resigned. No one would think he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Rourke</b></font>)'d make such a beautiful corpse.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sipped a little more from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) glass and said: <div class="bookquote">``Well, Miss Flynn, at any rate it must be a great comfort for you to know that you did all you could for him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Rourke</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, indeed,'' said my aunt. You were both very kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Rourke</b></font>), I must say. '' Eliza smoothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) dress over her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) knees.
<p/>God knows we done all we could, as poor as we are--we wouldn't see him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) want anything while he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was in it.
<p/>'' Ah, poor James! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said. '' '' Nannie had leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Nannie</b></font>) head against the sofa-pillow and seemed about to fall asleep.
<p/>All the work we had, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nannie</b></font>) and me, getting in the woman to wash him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) and then laying him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) out and then the coffin and then arranging about the Mass in the chapel.
<p/>'' There's poor Nannie,'' said Eliza, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>)'s wore out. Only for Father O'Rourke I don't know what we'd have done at all.
<p/>It was him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Rourke</b></font>) brought us all them flowers and them two candlesticks out of the chapel and wrote out the notice for the Freeman's General and took charge of all the papers for the cemetery and poor James's insurance.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>Ah, there's no friends like the old friends,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said, ``when all is said and done, no friends that a body can trust.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wasn't that good of him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said my aunt. Eliza closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) eyes and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) head slowly. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Indeed, that's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said my aunt.
<p/>'' And I'm sure now that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)'s gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) eternal reward he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) won't forget you and all your kindness to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>).
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, poor James!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza</b></font>)</div>said Eliza. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was no great trouble to us. You wouldn't hear him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) in the house any more than now.
<p/>Still, I know he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)'s gone and all to that... '' '' It's when it's all over that you'll miss him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>),'' said my aunt.
<p/>'' I know that,'' said Eliza. '' I won't be bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) cup of beef-tea any more, nor you, ma'am, sending him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) snuff.
<p/>Ah, poor James! '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) stopped, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) were communing with the past and then said shrewdly: ``Mind you, I noticed there was something queer coming over him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) latterly.
<p/>Whenever I'd bring in his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) soup to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) there I'd find him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) breviary fallen to the floor, lying back in the chair and his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) mouth open.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) laid a finger against her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) nose and frowned: then she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) continued: <div class="bookquote">``But still and all he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) kept on saying that before the summer was over he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)'d go out for a drive one fine day just to see the old house again where we were all born down in Irishtown and take me and Nannie with him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>).
<p/>If we could only get one of them new-fangled carriages that makes no noise that Father O'Rourke told him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Rourke</b></font>) about--them with the rheumatic wheels--for the day cheap--he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Rourke</b></font>) said, at Johnny Rush's over the way there and drive out the three of us together of a Sunday evening.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Rourke</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Rourke</b></font>) mind set on that.... Poor James!'' '' The Lord have mercy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) soul!'' said my aunt.
<p/>Eliza took out her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) handkerchief and wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) eyes with it. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) put it back again in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) pocket and gazed into the empty grate for some time without speaking.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was too scrupulous always,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said. '' The duties of the priesthood was too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>). And then his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) life was, you might say, crossed.''
<p/>A silence took possession of the little room and, under cover of it, I approached the table and tasted my sherry and then returned quietly to my chair in the comer.
<p/>'' Yes,'' said my aunt. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was a disappointed man. You could see that. '' Eliza seemed to have fallen into a deep revery.
<p/>We waited respectfully for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) to break the silence: and after a long pause she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said slowly: <div class="bookquote">``It was that chalice he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) broke....
<p/>That was the beginning of it. Of course, they say it was all right, that it contained nothing, I mean. But still.... They say it was the boy's fault.
<p/>But poor James was so nervous , God be merciful to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' And was that it?'' said my aunt. ''
<p/>I heard something... '' Eliza nodded. '' That affected his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mind,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said. '' After that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) began to mope by himself, talking to no one and wandering about by himself.
<p/>So one night he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was wanted for to go on a call and they couldn't find him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) anywhere. They looked high up and low down; and still they couldn't see a sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) anywhere.
<p/>So then they got the keys and opened the chapel and the clerk and Father O'Rourke and another priest that was there brought in a light for to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)....
<p/>So then the clerk suggested to try the chapel. And what do you think but there he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was, sitting up by himself in the dark in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) confession-box, wide-awake and laughing-like softly to himself?
<p/>I too listened; but there was no sound in the house: and I knew that the old priest was lying still in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) coffin as we had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), solemn and truculent in death, an idle chalice on his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) breast.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) stopped suddenly as if to listen. Eliza resumed: <div class="bookquote">``Wide-awake and laughing-like to himself.... So then, of course, when they saw that, that made them think that there was something gone wrong with him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza</b></font>)</div>AN ENCOUNTER IT WAS Joe Dillon who introduced the Wild West to us. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dillon</b></font>) had a little library made up of old numbers of The Union Jack, Pluck and The Halfpenny Marvel.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fat young brother Leo, the idler, held the loft of the stable while we tried to carry it by storm; or we fought a pitched battle on the grass.
<p/>But, however well we fought, we never won siege or battle and all our bouts ended with Joe Dillon's war dance of victory.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Dillon</b></font>) parents went to eight-o'clock mass every morning in Gardiner Street and the peaceful odour of Mrs. Dillon was prevalent in the hall of the house.
<p/>Every evening after school we met in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) back garden and arranged Indian battles. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) played too fiercely for us who were younger and more timid.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) looked like some kind of an Indian when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) capered round the garden, an old tea-cosy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) head, beating a tin with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) fist and yelling:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ya! yaka, yaka, yaka! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Everyone was incredulous when it was reported that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had a vocation for the priesthood. Nevertheless it was true.
<p/>We banded ourselves together, some boldly, some in jest and some almost in fear: and of the number of these latter, the reluctant Indians who were afraid to seem studious or lacking in robustness, I was one.
<p/>The adventures related in the literature of the Wild West were remote from my nature but, at least, they opened doors of escape.
<p/>A spirit of unruliness diffused itself among us and, under its influence, differences of culture and constitution were waived. I liked better some American detective stories which were traversed from time to time by unkempt fierce and beautiful girls.
<p/>Though there was nothing wrong in these stories and though their intention was sometimes literary they were circulated secretly at school.
<p/>One day when Father Butler was hearing the four pages of Roman History clumsy Leo Dillon was discovered with a copy of The Halfpenny Marvel.
<p/>'' This page or this page? This page Now, Dillon, up! ' Hardly had the day'... Go on! What day? '
<p/>Hardly had the day dawned'... Have you studied it? What have you there in your pocket? '' Everyone's heart palpitated as Leo Dillon handed up the paper and everyone assumed an innocent face.
<p/>Father Butler turned over the pages, frowning. '' What is this rubbish? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) said. '' The Apache Chief! Is this what you read instead of studying your Roman History?
<p/>Let me not find any more of this wretched stuff in this college. The man who wrote it, I suppose, was some wretched fellow who writes these things for a drink.
<p/>I'm surprised at boys like you, educated, reading such stuff. I could understand it if you were... National School boys. Now, Dillon, I advise you strongly, get at your work or...
<p/>This rebuke during the sober hours of school paled much of the glory of the Wild West for me and the confused puffy face of Leo Dillon
<p/>But when the restraining influence of the school was at a distance I began to hunger again for wild sensations, for the escape which those chronicles of disorder alone seemed to offer me.
<p/>The mimic warfare of the evening became at last as wearisome to me as the routine of school in the morning because I wanted real adventures to happen to myself.
<p/>'' awakened one of my consciences. But real adventures, I reflected, do not happen to people who remain at home: they must be sought abroad.
<p/>The summer holidays were near at hand when I made up my mind to break out of the weariness of school-life for one day at least.
<p/>With Leo Dillon and a boy named Mahony I planned a day's miching. Each of us saved up sixpence. We were to meet at ten in the morning on the Canal Bridge.
<p/>Mahony's big sister was to write an excuse for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) and Leo Dillon was to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Dillon</b></font>) brother to say he (<font color='blue'><b>Dillon</b></font>) was sick.
<p/>We arranged to go along the Wharf Road until we came to the ships, then to cross in the ferryboat and walk out to see the Pigeon House.
<p/>Leo Dillon was afraid we might meet Father Butler or someone out of the college; but Mahony asked, very sensibly, what would Father Butler be doing out at the Pigeon House.
<p/>We were reassured: and I brought the first stage of the plot to an end by collecting sixpence from the other two, at the same time showing them my own sixpence.
<p/>When we were making the last arrangements on the eve we were all vaguely excited. We shook hands, laughing, and Mahony said: <div class="bookquote">``Till tomorrow, mates!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mahony</b></font>)</div><p/>I hid my books in the long grass near the ashpit at the end of the garden where nobody ever came and hurried along the canal bank.
<p/>That night I slept badly. In the morning I was first-comer to the bridge as I lived nearest. It was a mild sunny morning in the first week of June.
<p/>I sat up on the coping of the bridge admiring my frail canvas shoes which I had diligently pipeclayed overnight and watching the docile horses pulling a tramload of business people up the hill.
<p/>All the branches of the tall trees which lined the mall were gay with little light green leaves and the sunlight slanted through them on to the water.
<p/>The granite stone of the bridge was beginning to be warm and I began to pat it with my hands in time to an air in my head.
<p/>I was very happy. When I had been sitting there for five or ten minutes I saw Mahony's grey suit approaching.
<p/>While we were waiting he (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) brought out the catapult which bulged from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) inner pocket and explained some improvements which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) had made in it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) came up the hill, smiling, and clambered up beside me on the bridge. I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) had brought it
<p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) had brought it to have some gas with the birds. Mahony used slang freely, and spoke of Father Butler as Old Bunser.
<p/>We waited on for a quarter of an hour more but still there was no sign of Leo Dillon. Mahony, at last, jumped down and said: <div class="bookquote">``Come along.
<p/>I knew Fatty'd funk it.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mahony</b></font>)</div>'' And his (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) sixpence...? '' I said. '' That's forfeit,'' said Mahony. '' And so much the better for us--a bob and a tanner instead of a bob.
<p/>We walked along the North Strand Road till we came to the Vitriol Works and then turned to the right along the Wharf Road.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) chased a crowd of ragged girls, brandishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) unloaded catapult and, when two ragged boys began, out of chivalry, to fling stones at us, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) proposed that we should charge them.
<p/>'' Mahony began to play the Indian as soon as we were out of public sight. I objected that the boys were too small and so we walked on, the ragged troop screaming after us:
<p/>'' thinking that we were Protestants because Mahony, who was dark-complexioned, wore the silver badge of a cricket club in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) cap.
<p/>When we came to the Smoothing Iron we arranged a siege; but it was a failure because you must have at least three.
<p/>We revenged ourselves on Leo Dillon by saying what a funk he (<font color='blue'><b>Dillon</b></font>) was and guessing how many he (<font color='blue'><b>Dillon</b></font>) would get at three o'clock from Mr. Ryan.
<p/>We spent a long time walking about the noisy streets flanked by high stone walls, watching the working of cranes and engines and often being shouted at for our immobility by the drivers of groaning carts.
<p/>It was noon when we reached the quays and, as all the labourers seemed to be eating their lunches, we bought two big currant buns and sat down to eat them on some metal piping beside the river.
<p/>We pleased ourselves with the spectacle of Dublin's commerce--the barges signalled from far away by their curls of woolly smoke, the brown fishing fleet beyond Ringsend, the big white sailing-vessel which was being discharged on the opposite quay.
<p/>Mahony said it would be right skit to run away to sea on one of those big ships and even I, looking at the high masts, saw, or imagined, the geography which had been scantily dosed to me at school gradually taking substance under my eyes.
<p/>``Swaddlers! Swaddlers! We came then near the river. School and home seemed to recede from us and their influences upon us seemed to wane.
<p/>We crossed the Liffey in the ferryboat, paying our toll to be transported in the company of two labourers and a little Jew with a bag.
<p/>We were serious to the point of solemnity, but once during the short voyage our eyes met and we laughed. When we landed we watched the discharging of the graceful threemaster which we had observed from the other quay.
<p/>I went to the stern and tried to decipher the legend upon it but, failing to do so, I came back and examined the foreign sailors to see had any of them green eyes for I had some confused notion....
<p/>The only sailor whose eyes could have been called green was a tall man who amused the crowd on the quay by calling out cheerfully every time the planks fell:
<p/>Some bystander said that she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) was a Norwegian vessel. The sailors' eyes were blue and grey and even black. <div class="bookquote">``All right!
<p/>All right! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>When we were tired of this sight we wandered slowly into Ringsend. The day had grown sultry, and in the windows of the grocers' shops musty biscuits lay bleaching.
<p/>We bought some biscuits and chocolate which we ate sedulously as we wandered through the squalid streets where the families of the fishermen live.
<p/>We could find no dairy and so we went into a huckster's shop and bought a bottle of raspberry lemonade each.
<p/>We both felt rather tired and when we reached the field we made at once for a sloping bank over the ridge of which we could see the Dodder.
<p/>Refreshed by this, Mahony chased a cat down a lane, but the cat escaped into a wide field. It was too late and we were too tired to carry out our project of visiting the Pigeon House.
<p/>We had to be home before four o'clock lest our adventure should be discovered. Mahony looked regretfully at his (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) catapult and I had to suggest going home by train before he (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) regained any cheerfulness.
<p/>The sun went in behind some clouds and left us to our jaded thoughts and the crumbs of our provisions. There was nobody but ourselves in the field.
<p/>When we had lain on the bank for some time without speaking I saw a man approaching from the far end of the field.
<p/>I watched him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lazily as I chewed one of those green stems on which girls tell fortunes. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came along by the bank slowly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked with one hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hip and in the other hand he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held a stick with which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tapped the turf lightly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was shabbily dressed in a suit of greenish-black and wore what we used to call a jerry hat with a high crown.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to be fairly old for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moustache was ashen-grey. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed at our feet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glanced up at us quickly and then continued his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way.
<p/>We followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with our eyes and saw that when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gone on for perhaps fifty paces he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned about and began to retrace his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) steps.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked towards us very slowly, always tapping the ground with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stick, so slowly that I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was looking for something in the grass.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came level with us and bade us good-day. We answered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat down beside us on the slope slowly and with great care.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to talk of the weather, saying that it would be a very hot summer and adding that the seasons had changed greatly since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a boy--a long time ago.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said that the happiest time of one's life was undoubtedly one's school-boy days and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would give anything to be young again.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expressed these sentiments which bored us a little we kept silent. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to talk of school and of books.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked us whether we had read the poetry of Thomas Moore or the works of Sir Walter Scott and Lord Lytton.
<p/>I pretended that I had read every book he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) mentioned so that in the end he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Ah, I can see you are a bookworm like myself.
<p/>Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) added, pointing to Mahony who was regarding us with open eyes, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) is different; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) goes in for games.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) had all Sir Walter Scott's works and all Lord Lytton's works at home and never tired of reading them.
<p/>Mahony asked why couldn't boys read them--a question which agitated and pained me because I was afraid the man would think I was as stupid as Mahony.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mahony</b></font>)</div>'' Of course,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``there were some of Lord Lytton's works which boys couldn't read. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The man, however, only smiled.
<p/>I saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had great gaps in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) yellow teeth. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked us which of us had the most sweethearts.
<p/>Mahony mentioned lightly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) had three totties. The man asked me how many had I. I answered that I had none.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not believe me and said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sure I must have one. I was silent. <div class="bookquote">``Tell us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mahony</b></font>)</div>said Mahony pertly to the man, <div class="bookquote">``how many have you yourself?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>The man smiled as before and said that when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was our age he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lots of sweethearts. '' Every boy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``has a little sweetheart.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) attitude on this point struck me as strangely liberal in a man of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) age. In my heart I thought that what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said about boys and sweethearts was reasonable.
<p/>But I disliked the words in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth and I wondered why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shivered once or twice as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feared something or felt a sudden chill.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to speak to us about girls, saying what nice soft hair they had and how soft their hands were and how all girls were not so good as they seemed to be if one only knew.
<p/>There was nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, so much as looking at a nice young girl, at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nice white hands and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beautiful soft hair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave me the impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was repeating something which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had learned by heart or that, magnetised by some words of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own speech, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind was slowly circling round and round in the same orbit.
<p/>At times he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were simply alluding to some fact that everybody knew, and at times he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lowered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice and spoke mysteriously as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were telling us something secret which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not wish others to overhear.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) proceeded I noticed that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) accent was good. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) phrases over and over again, varying them and surrounding them with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) monotonous voice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood up slowly, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to leave us for a minute or so, a few minutes, and, without changing the direction of my gaze, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walking slowly away from us towards the near end of the field.
<p/>I continued to gaze towards the foot of the slope, listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). After a long while his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) monologue paused. We remained silent when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gone.
<p/>After a silence of a few minutes I heard Mahony exclaim: <div class="bookquote">``I say! Look what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>)'s doing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mahony</b></font>)</div>As I neither answered nor raised my eyes Mahony exclaimed again: <div class="bookquote">``I say...
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>)'s a queer old josser!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mahony</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In case he (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) asks us for our names,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``let you be Murphy and I'll be Smith.
<p/>I was still considering whether I would go away or not when the man came back and sat down beside us again.
<p/>Hardly had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat down when Mahony, catching sight of the cat which had escaped him (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>), sprang up and pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>cat</b></font>) across the field.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>We said nothing further to each other. The man and I watched the chase. The cat escaped once more and Mahony began to throw stones at the wall she (<font color='blue'><b>cat</b></font>) had escaladed.
<p/>Desisting from this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) began to wander about the far end of the field, aimlessly. After an interval the man spoke to me.
<p/>I was going to reply indignantly that we were not National School boys to be whipped, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called it; but I remained silent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said that my friend was a very rough boy and asked did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) get whipped often at school. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to speak on the subject of chastising boys.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, as if magnetised again by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speech, seemed to circle slowly round and round its new centre. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said that when boys were that kind they ought to be whipped and well whipped.
<p/>A slap on the hand or a box on the ear was no good: what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted was to get a nice warm whipping.
<p/>When a boy was rough and unruly there was nothing would do him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) any good but a good sound whipping. I was surprised at this sentiment and involuntarily glanced up at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face.
<p/>As I did so I met the gaze of a pair of bottle-green eyes peering at me from under a twitching forehead.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said that if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) found a boy talking to girls or having a girl for a sweetheart he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would whip him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and whip him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); and that would teach him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) not to be talking to girls.
<p/>And if a boy had a girl for a sweetheart and told lies about it then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) such a whipping as no boy ever got in this world.
<p/>I turned my eyes away again. The man continued his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) monologue. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to have forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recent liberalism. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said that there was nothing in this world he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would like so well as that.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would love that, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, better than anything in this world; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) led me monotonously through the mystery, grew almost affectionate and seemed to plead with me that I should understand him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) described to me how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would whip such a boy as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were unfolding some elaborate mystery. I waited till his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) monologue paused again.
<p/>Then I stood up abruptly. Lest I should betray my agitation I delayed a few moments pretending to fix my shoe properly and then, saying that I was obliged to go
<p/>, I bade him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good-day. I went up the slope calmly but my heart was beating quickly with fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would seize me by the ankles.
<p/>When I reached the top of the slope I turned round and, without looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), called loudly across the field: <div class="bookquote">``Murphy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>My voice had an accent of forced bravery in it and I was ashamed of my paltry stratagem. I had to call the name again before Mahony saw me and hallooed in answer.
<p/>How my heart beat as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) came running across the field to me! He (<font color='blue'><b>Mahony</b></font>) ran as if to bring me aid.
<p/>ARABY NORTH RICHMOND STREET, being blind, was a quiet street except at the hour when the Christian Brothers' School set the boys free.
<p/>And I was penitent; for in my heart I had always despised him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) a little. An uninhabited house of two storeys stood at the blind end, detached from its neighbours in a square ground
<p/>The other houses of the street, conscious of decent lives within them, gazed at one another with brown imperturbable faces. The former tenant of our house, a priest, had died in the back drawing-room.
<p/>Air, musty from having been long enclosed, hung in all the rooms, and the waste room behind the kitchen was littered with old useless papers.
<p/>Among these I found a few paper-covered books, the pages of which were curled and damp: The Abbot, by Walter Scott, The Devout Communicant and The Memoirs of Vidocq.
<p/>The wild garden behind the house contained a central apple-tree and a few straggling bushes under one of which I found the late tenant's rusty bicycle-pump.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) had been a very charitable priest; in his (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) will he (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) had left all his (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) money to institutions and the furniture of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) house to his (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) sister.
<p/>I liked the last best because its leaves were yellow. When the short days of winter came dusk fell before we had well eaten our dinners.
<p/>The space of sky above us was the colour of ever-changing violet and towards it the lamps of the street lifted their feeble lanterns.
<p/>When we met in the street the houses had grown sombre. The cold air stung us and we played till our bodies glowed.
<p/>The career of our play brought us through the dark muddy lanes behind the houses where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes from the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping gardens where odours arose from the ashpits, to the dark odorous stables where a coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled harness.
<p/>Our shouts echoed in the silent street. When we returned to the street light from the kitchen windows had filled the areas.
<p/>Or if Mangan's sister came out on the doorstep to call her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother in to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) tea we watched her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) from our shadow peer up and down the street.
<p/>We waited to see whether she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would remain or go in and, if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) remained, we left our shadow and walked up to Mangan's steps resignedly.
<p/>If my uncle was seen turning the corner we hid in the shadow until we had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) safely housed. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was waiting for us, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) figure defined by the light from the half-opened door.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother always teased her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) obeyed and I stood by the railings looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) dress swung as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) moved her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) body and the soft rope of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hair tossed from side to side.
<p/>Every morning I lay on the floor in the front parlour watching her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) door. The blind was pulled down to within an inch of the sash so that I could not be seen.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) came out on the doorstep my heart leaped. I ran to the hall, seized my books and followed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).
<p/>I kept her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brown figure always in my eye and, when we came near the point at which our ways diverged, I quickened my pace and passed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).
<p/>I had never spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), except for a few casual words, and yet her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) name was like a summons to all my foolish blood.
<p/>This happened morning after morning. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) image accompanied me even in places the most hostile to romance. On Saturday evenings when my aunt went marketing I had to go to carry some of the parcels.
<p/>We walked through the flaring streets, jostled by drunken men and bargaining women, amid the curses of labourers, the shrill litanies of shop-boys who stood on guard by the barrels of pigs' cheeks, the nasal chanting of street-singers, who sang a come-all-you about O'Donovan Rossa, or a ballad about the troubles in our native land.
<p/>These noises converged in a single sensation of life for me: I imagined that I bore my chalice safely through a throng of foes.
<p/>My eyes were often full of tears -LRB-I could not tell why-RRB- and at times a flood from my heart seemed to pour itself out into my bosom.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) name sprang to my lips at moments in strange prayers and praises which I myself did not understand. I thought little of the future.
<p/>I did not know whether I would ever speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) or not or, if I spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), how I could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) of my confused adoration.
<p/>But my body was like a harp and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) words and gestures were like fingers running upon the wires. One evening I went into the back drawing-room in which the priest had died.
<p/>Through one of the broken panes I heard the rain impinge upon the earth, the fine incessant needles of water playing in the sodden beds.
<p/>It was a dark rainy evening and there was no sound in the house. Some distant lamp or lighted window gleamed below me.
<p/>All my senses seemed to desire to veil themselves and, feeling that I was about to slip from them, I pressed the palms of my hands together until they trembled, murmuring: <div class="bookquote">``O love!
<p/>I was thankful that I could see so little. O love! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>many times. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) spoke to me. When she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) addressed the first words to me
<p/>I was so confused that I did not know what to answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) asked me was I going to Araby. I forgot whether I answered yes or no.
<p/>It would be a splendid bazaar, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said;s she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would love to go. '' And why can't you? '' I asked.
<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) spoke she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) turned a silver bracelet round and round her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wrist. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could not go, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, because there would be a retreat that week in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) convent.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) brother and two other boys were fighting for their caps and I was alone at the railings. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) held one of the spikes, bowing her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head towards me.
<p/>The light from the lamp opposite our door caught the white curve of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) neck, lit up her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hair that rested there and, falling, lit up the hand upon the railing.
<p/>It fell over one side of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dress and caught the white border of a petticoat, just visible as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stood at ease.
<p/>'' It's well for you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said. '' If I go,'' I said, <div class="bookquote">``I will bring you something. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>What innumerable follies laid waste my waking and sleeping thoughts after that evening!
<p/>At night in my bedroom and by day in the classroom her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) image came between me and the page I strove to read.
<p/>The syllables of the word Araby were called to me through the silence in which my soul luxuriated and cast an Eastern enchantment over me.
<p/>I wished to annihilate the tedious intervening days. I chafed against the work of school. I asked for leave to go to the bazaar on Saturday night.
<p/>My aunt was surprised and hoped it was not some Freemason affair. I answered few questions in class. I watched my master's face pass from amiability to sternness; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) hoped I was not beginning to idle.
<p/>I had hardly any patience with the serious work of life which, now that it stood between me and my desire, seemed to me child's play, ugly monotonous child's play.
<p/>I could not call my wandering thoughts together. On Saturday morning I reminded my uncle that I wished to go to the bazaar in the evening.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was fussing at the hallstand, looking for the hat-brush, and answered me curtly: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, boy, I know. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was in the hall I could not go into the front parlour and lie at the window.
<p/>I left the house in bad humour and walked slowly towards the school. The air was pitilessly raw and already my heart misgave me.
<p/>I sat staring at the clock for some time and, when its ticking began to irritate me, I left the room.
<p/>When I came home to dinner my uncle had not yet been home. Still it was early. I mounted the staircase and gained the upper part of the house.
<p/>The high cold empty gloomy rooms liberated me and I went from room to room singing. From the front window I saw my companions playing below in the street.
<p/>Their cries reached me weakened and indistinct and, leaning my forehead against the cool glass, I looked over at the dark house where she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) lived.
<p/>I may have stood there for an hour, seeing nothing but the brown-clad figure cast by my imagination, touched discreetly by the lamplight at the curved neck, at the hand upon the railings and at the border below the dress.
<p/>When I came downstairs again I found Mrs. Mercer sitting at the fire. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mercer</b></font>) was an old garrulous woman, a pawnbroker's widow, who collected used stamps for some pious purpose.
<p/>I had to endure the gossip of the tea-table. The meal was prolonged beyond an hour and still my uncle did not come.
<p/>Mrs. Mercer stood up to go: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mercer</b></font>) was sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Mercer</b></font>) couldn't wait any longer, but it was after eight o'clock and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mercer</b></font>) did not like to be out late as the night air was bad for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mercer</b></font>).
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mercer</b></font>) had gone I began to walk up and down the room, clenching my fists. My aunt said: <div class="bookquote">``I'm afraid you may put off your bazaar for this night of Our Lord.''
 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>At nine o'clock I heard my uncle's latchkey in the halldoor. I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) talking to himself and heard the hallstand rocking when it had received the weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) overcoat.
<p/>I could interpret these signs. When he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was midway through his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) dinner I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to give me the money to go to the bazaar.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had forgotten. '' The people are in bed and after their first sleep now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said. I did not smile.
<p/>My aunt said to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) energetically: <div class="bookquote">``Can't you give him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) the money and let him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) go? You've kept him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) late enough as it is.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>My uncle said he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was very sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had forgotten. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) believed in the old saying: <div class="bookquote">``All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) asked me where I was going and, when I had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) a second time he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) asked me did I know The Arab's Farewell to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) Steed.
<p/>When I left the kitchen he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was about to recite the opening lines of the piece to my aunt. I held a florin tightly in my hand as I strode down Buckingham Street towards the station.
<p/>The sight of the streets thronged with buyers and glaring with gas recalled to me the purpose of my journey. I took my seat in a third-class carriage of a deserted train.
<p/>After an intolerable delay the train moved out of the station slowly. It crept onward among ruinous houses and over the twinkling river.
<p/>At Westland Row Station a crowd of people pressed to the carriage doors; but the porters moved them back, saying that it was a special train for the bazaar.
<p/>I passed out on to the road and saw by the lighted dial of a clock that it was ten minutes to ten.
<p/>I remained alone in the bare carriage. In a few minutes the train drew up beside an improvised wooden platform. In front of me was a large building which displayed the magical name.
<p/>I could not find any sixpenny entrance and, fearing that the bazaar would be closed, I passed in quickly through a turnstile, handing a shilling to a weary-looking man.
<p/>I found myself in a big hall girdled at half its height by a gallery. Nearly all the stalls were closed and the greater part of the hall was in darkness.
<p/>I recognised a silence like that which pervades a church after a service. I walked into the centre of the bazaar timidly.
<p/>Before a curtain, over which the words Cafe Chantant were written in coloured lamps, two men were counting money on a salver.
<p/>A few people were gathered about the stalls which were still open. I listened to the fall of the coins. Remembering with difficulty why I had come
<p/>I went over to one of the stalls and examined porcelain vases and flowered tea-sets. At the door of the stall a young lady was talking and laughing with two young gentlemen.
<p/>I remarked their English accents and listened vaguely to their conversation. '' O, I never said such a thing!'' <div class="bookquote">``O, but you did!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, but I didn't!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) say that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``O, there's a... fib!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Observing me the young lady came over and asked me did I wish to buy anything.
<p/>The tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) voice was not encouraging; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seemed to have spoken to me out of a sense of duty.
<p/>I looked humbly at the great jars that stood like eastern guards at either side of the dark entrance to the stall and murmured: <div class="bookquote">``No, thank you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>guards</b></font>)</div>The young lady changed the position of one of the vases and went back to the two young men. They began to talk of the same subject.
<p/>I lingered before her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stall, though I knew my stay was useless, to make my interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wares seem the more real.
<p/>Once or twice the young lady glanced at me over her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shoulder. Then I turned away slowly and walked down the middle of the bazaar.
<p/>I allowed the two pennies to fall against the sixpence in my pocket. I heard a voice call from one end of the gallery that the light was out.
<p/>Gazing up into the darkness I saw myself as a creature driven and derided by vanity; and my eyes burned with anguish and anger.
<p/>The upper part of the hall was now completely dark. EVELINE SHE sat at the window watching the evening invade the avenue.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>EVELINE</b></font>) head was leaned against the window curtains and in her (<font color='blue'><b>EVELINE</b></font>) nostrils was the odour of dusty cretonne. She (<font color='blue'><b>EVELINE</b></font>) was tired.
<p/>The man out of the last house passed on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way home; she (<font color='blue'><b>EVELINE</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) footsteps clacking along the concrete pavement and afterwards crunching on the cinder path before the new red houses.
<p/>One time there used to be a field there in which they used to play every evening with other people's children.
<p/>Then a man from Belfast bought the field and built houses in it--not like their little brown houses but bright brick houses with shining roofs.
<p/>The children of the avenue used to play together in that field--the Devines, the Waters, the Dunns, little Keogh the cripple, she (<font color='blue'><b>EVELINE</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>EVELINE</b></font>) brothers and sisters.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>EVELINE</b></font>) father used often to hunt them in out of the field with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) blackthorn stick; but usually little Keogh used to keep nix and call out when he (<font color='blue'><b>Keogh</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>EVELINE</b></font>) father coming.
<p/>Few people passed. Ernest, however, never played: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) was too grown up. Still they seemed to have been rather happy then.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>EVELINE</b></font>) father was not so bad then; and besides, her (<font color='blue'><b>EVELINE</b></font>) mother was alive. That was a long time ago ; she (<font color='blue'><b>EVELINE</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>EVELINE</b></font>) brothers and sisters were all grown up; her (<font color='blue'><b>EVELINE</b></font>) mother was dead.
<p/>Tizzie Dunn was dead, too, and the Waters had gone back to England. Everything changes. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>EVELINE</b></font>) was going to go away like the others, to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>EVELINE</b></font>) home.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>EVELINE</b></font>) looked round the room, reviewing all its familiar objects which she (<font color='blue'><b>EVELINE</b></font>) had dusted once a week for so many years, wondering where on earth all the dust came from.
<p/>And yet during all those years she (<font color='blue'><b>EVELINE</b></font>) had never found out the name of the priest whose yellowing photograph hung on the wall above the broken harmonium beside the coloured print of the promises made to Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque.
<p/>Home! Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would never see again those familiar objects from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had never dreamed of being divided. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) had been a school friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father.
<p/>Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) showed the photograph to a visitor her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father used to pass it with a casual word: <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is in Melbourne now.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had consented to go away, to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) home. Was that wise? She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) tried to weigh each side of the question.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) home anyway she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had shelter and food; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had those whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had known all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) life about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).
<p/>What would they say of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in the Stores when they found out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had run away with a fellow?
<p/>Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had to work hard, both in the house and at business. Say she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was a fool, perhaps; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) place would be filled up by advertisement.
<p/>Miss Gavan would be glad. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had always had an edge on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), especially whenever there were people listening. '' Miss Hill, don't you see these ladies are waiting?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Look lively, Miss Hill, please. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not cry many tears at leaving the Stores. But in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) new home, in a distant unknown country, it would not be like that.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would be married--she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), Eveline. People would treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) with respect then. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) would not be treated as her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) mother had been.
<p/>Even now, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) was over nineteen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) sometimes felt herself in danger of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) father's violence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) knew it was that that had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) the palpitations.
<p/>When they were growing up he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had never gone for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) like he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) used to go for Harry and Ernest, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) was a girl; but latterly he (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) had begun to threaten her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) and say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) would do to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) only for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) dead mother's sake.
<p/>And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) had nobody to protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>). Ernest was dead and Harry, who was in the church decorating business, was nearly always down somewhere in the country.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) always gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) entire wages--seven shillings--and Harry always sent up what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could but the trouble was to get any money from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) father.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) used to squander the money, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) had no head, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wasn't going to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hard-earned money to throw about the streets, and much more, for he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was usually fairly bad of a Saturday night.
<p/>Besides, the invariable squabble for money on Saturday nights had begun to weary her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) unspeakably. In the end he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) the money and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) had she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) any intention of buying Sunday's dinner.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) had to rush out as quickly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) could and do her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) marketing, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) black leather purse tightly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) hand as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) elbowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) way through the crowds and returning home late under her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) load of provisions.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) had hard work to keep the house together and to see that the two young children who had been left to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) charge went to school regularly and got their meals regularly.
<p/>It was hard work--a hard life--but now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) was about to leave it she (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) did not find it a wholly undesirable life.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) was to go away with him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) by the night-boat to be his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wife and to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) in Buenos Ayres where he (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) had a home waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>How well she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) remembered the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) was lodging in a house on the main road where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) used to visit.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was about to explore another life with Frank. Frank was very kind, manly, open-hearted. It seemed a few weeks ago.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was standing at the gate, his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) peaked cap pushed back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) head and his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) hair tumbled forward over a face of bronze.
<p/>Then they had come to know each other. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) used to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) outside the Stores every evening and see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) home.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to see The Bohemian Girl and she (<font color='blue'><b>Girl</b></font>) felt elated as she (<font color='blue'><b>Girl</b></font>) sat in an unaccustomed part of the theatre with him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>).
<p/>People knew that they were courting and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) sang about the lass that loves a sailor, she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) always felt pleasantly confused.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was awfully fond of music and sang a little. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) used to call her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) Poppens out of fun. First of all it had been an excitement for her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) to have a fellow
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had started as a deck boy at a pound a month on a ship of the Allan Line going out to Canada.
<p/>and then she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) had begun to like him (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) had tales of distant countries. He (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) the names of the ships he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) had been on and the names of the different services.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) had fallen on his (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) feet in Buenos Ayres, he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) said, and had come over to the old country just for a holiday.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) had sailed through the Straits of Magellan and he (<font color='blue'><b>Allan</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) stories of the terrible Patagonians. Of course, her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) father had found out the affair and had forbidden her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) to have anything to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>'' I know these sailor chaps,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) said. One day he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) had quarrelled with Frank and after that she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) had to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) lover secretly.
<p/>The evening deepened in the avenue. The white of two letters in her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) lap grew indistinct. One was to Harry; the other was to her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) father.
<p/>Ernest had been her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) favourite but she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) liked Harry too. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) father was becoming old lately, she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) noticed; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would miss her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>).
<p/>Not long before, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) had been laid up for a day, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had read her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) out a ghost story and made toast for her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) at the fire.
<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could be very nice. Another day, when their mother was alive, they had all gone for a picnic to the Hill of Howth.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) time was running out but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) continued to sit by the window, leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head against the window curtain, inhaling the odour of dusty cretonne.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's bonnet to make the children laugh. Down far in the avenue she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could hear a street organ playing.
<p/>Strange that it should come that very night to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) of the promise to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) promise to keep the home together as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) remembered the last night of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's illness; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was again in the close dark room at the other side of the hall and outside she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heard a melancholy air of Italy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew the air. The organ-player had been ordered to go away and given sixpence. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father strutting back into the sickroom saying:
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mused the pitiful vision of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's life laid its spell on the very quick of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) being--that life of commonplace sacrifices closing in final craziness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Damned Italians! coming over here!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) trembled as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heard again her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother's voice saying constantly with foolish insistence: <div class="bookquote">``Derevaun Seraun!
<p/>Derevaun Seraun! ''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stood up in a sudden impulse of terror. Escape! She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must escape! Frank would save her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) would give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life, perhaps love, too.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wanted to live. Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) be unhappy? She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had a right to happiness. Frank would take her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) arms, fold her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) arms.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), saying something about the passage over and over again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) would save her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stood among the swaying crowd in the station at the North Wall. The station was full of soldiers with brown baggages.
<p/>Through the wide doors of the sheds she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) caught a glimpse of the black mass of the boat, lying in beside the quay wall, with illumined portholes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cheek pale and cold and, out of a maze of distress, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) prayed to God to direct her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), to show her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) what was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) duty.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered nothing. The boat blew a long mournful whistle into the mist. If she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went, tomorrow she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would be on the sea with Frank, steaming towards Buenos Ayres.
<p/>Their passage had been booked. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) still draw back after all he (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) had done for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)? Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) distress awoke a nausea in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) body and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) kept moving her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lips in silent fervent prayer.
<p/>A bell clanged upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt him (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) seize her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand: <div class="bookquote">``Come! ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>All the seas of the world tumbled about her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) was drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) into them: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) would drown her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gripped with both hands at the iron railing. <div class="bookquote">``Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No!
<p/>No! No! It was impossible. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands clutched the iron in frenzy. Amid the seas she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) sent a cry of anguish!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eveline! Evvy!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) rushed beyond the barrier and called to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) to follow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) was shouted at to go on but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) still called to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) set her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) white face to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>), passive, like a helpless animal. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eveline</b></font>) eyes gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Ayres</b></font>) no sign of love or farewell or recognition.
<p/>AFTER THE RACE THE cars came scudding in towards Dublin, running evenly like pellets in the groove of the Naas Road.
<p/>At the crest of the hill at Inchicore sightseers had gathered in clumps to watch the cars careering homeward and through this channel of poverty and inaction the Continent sped its wealth and industry.
<p/>Now and again the clumps of people raised the cheer of the gratefully oppressed. Their sympathy, however, was for the blue cars--the cars of their friends, the French.
<p/>Their team had finished solidly; they had been placed second and third and the driver of the winning German car was reported a Belgian.
<p/>Each blue car, therefore, received a double measure of welcome as it topped the crest of the hill and each cheer of welcome was acknowledged with smiles and nods by those in the car.
<p/>In one of these trimly built cars was a party of four young men whose spirits seemed to be at present well above the level of successful Gallicism: in fact, these four young men were almost hilarious.
<p/>They were Charles Segouin, the owner of the car; Andre Riviere, a young electrician of Canadian birth; a huge Hungarian named Villona and a neatly groomed young man named Doyle.
<p/>Segouin was in good humour because he (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) had unexpectedly received some orders in advance -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) was about to start a motor establishment in Paris-RRB-
<p/>and Riviere was in good humour because he (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) was to be appointed manager of the establishment; these two young men -LRB-who were cousins-RRB- were also in good humour because of the success of the French cars.
<p/>Villona was in good humour because he (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) had had a very satisfactory luncheon; and besides he (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) was an optimist by nature.
<p/>The French, moreover, were virtual victors. The fourth member of the party, however, was too excited to be genuinely happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) was about twenty-six years of age, with a soft, light brown moustache and rather innocent-looking grey eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) money as a butcher in Kingstown and by opening shops in Dublin and in the suburbs he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) money many times over.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had also been fortunate enough to secure some of the police contracts and in the end he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had become rich enough to be alluded to in the Dublin newspapers as a merchant prince.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) had sent his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) son to England to be educated in a big Catholic college and had afterwards sent him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) to Dublin University to study law.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) father, who had begun life as an advanced Nationalist, had modified his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) views early. Jimmy did not study very earnestly and took to bad courses for a while.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) had money and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) was popular; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) divided his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) time curiously between musical and motoring circles. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) had been sent for a term to Cambridge to see a little life.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) father, remonstrative, but covertly proud of the excess, had paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) bills and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) home. It was at Cambridge that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) had met Segouin.
<p/>They were not much more than acquaintances as yet but Jimmy found great pleasure in the society of one who had seen so much of the world and was reputed to own some of the biggest hotels in France.
<p/>Such a person -LRB-as his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) father agreed-RRB- was well worth knowing, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) had not been the charming companion he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) was.
<p/>Villona was entertaining also--a brilliant pianist--but, unfortunately, very poor. The car ran on merrily with its cargo of hilarious youth. The two cousins sat on the front seat; Jimmy and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) Hungarian friend sat behind.
<p/>The Frenchmen flung their laughter and light words over their shoulders and often Jimmy had to strain forward to catch the quick phrase.
<p/>This was not altogether pleasant for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) had nearly always to make a deft guess at the meaning and shout back a suitable answer in the face of a high wind.
<p/>Decidedly Villona was in excellent spirits; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) kept up a deep bass hum of melody for miles of the road. Besides Villona's humming would confuse anybody; the noise of the car, too.
<p/>Rapid motion through space elates one; so does notoriety; so does the possession of money. These were three good reasons for Jimmy's excitement.
<p/>At the control Segouin had presented him (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) to one of the French competitors and, in answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) confused murmur of compliment, the swarthy face of the driver had disclosed a line of shining white teeth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) had been seen by many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) friends that day in the company of these Continentals. It was pleasant after that honour to return to the profane world of spectators amid nudges and significant looks.
<p/>Then as to money--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) really had a great sum under his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) control. Segouin, perhaps, would not think it a great sum
<p/>but Jimmy who, in spite of temporary errors, was at heart the inheritor of solid instincts knew well with what difficulty it had been got together.
<p/>This knowledge had previously kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) bills within the limits of reasonable recklessness, and, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) had been so conscious of the labour latent in money when there had been question merely of some freak of the higher intelligence, how much more so now when he (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) was about to stake the greater part of his (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) substance!
<p/>Of course, the investment was a good one and Segouin had managed to give the impression that it was by a favour of friendship the mite of Irish money was to be included in the capital of the concern.
<p/>Jimmy had a respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) father's shrewdness in business matters and in this case it had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) father who had first suggested the investment; money to be made in the motor business, pots of money.
<p/>It was a serious thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>). Moreover Segouin had the unmistakable air of wealth. Jimmy set out to translate into days' work that lordly car in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) sat.
<p/>The journey laid a magical finger on the genuine pulse of life and gallantly the machinery of human nerves strove to answer the bounding courses of the swift blue animal.
<p/>How smoothly it ran. In what style they had come careering along the country roads! They drove down Dame Street. The street was busy with unusual traffic, loud with the horns of motorists and the gongs of impatient tram-drivers.
<p/>Near the Bank Segouin drew up and Jimmy and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) friend alighted. A little knot of people collected on the footpath to pay homage to the snorting motor.
<p/>The party was to dine together that evening in Segouin's hotel and, meanwhile, Jimmy and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) friend, who was staying with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>), were to go home to dress.
<p/>The car steered out slowly for Grafton Street while the two young men pushed their way through the knot of gazers.
<p/>They walked northward with a curious feeling of disappointment in the exercise, while the city hung its pale globes of light above them in a haze of summer evening.
<p/>A certain pride mingled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) parents' trepidation, a certain eagerness, also, to play fast and loose for the names of great foreign cities have at least this virtue.
<p/>Jimmy, too, looked very well when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) was dressed and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) stood in the hall giving a last equation to the bows of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) dress tie, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) father may have felt even commercially satisfied at having secured for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) son qualities often unpurchaseable.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) father, therefore, was unusually friendly with Villona and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) manner expressed a real respect for foreign accomplishments; but this subtlety of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) host was probably lost upon the Hungarian, who was beginning to have a sharp desire for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) dinner.
<p/>In Jimmy's house this dinner had been pronounced an occasion. The dinner was excellent, exquisite. Segouin, Jimmy decided, had a very refined taste.
<p/>The party was increased by a young Englishman named Routh whom Jimmy had seen with Segouin at Cambridge. The young men supped in a snug room lit by electric candle-lamps.
<p/>Jimmy, whose imagination was kindling, conceived the lively youth of the Frenchmen twined elegantly upon the firm framework of the Englishman's manner.
<p/>They talked volubly and with little reserve. A graceful image of his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) thought, and a just one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) admired the dexterity with which their host directed the conversation.
<p/>Villona, with immense respect, began to discover to the mildly surprised Englishman the beauties of the English madrigal, deploring the loss of old instruments.
<p/>The five young men had various tastes and their tongues had been loosened. Riviere, not wholly ingenuously, undertook to explain to Jimmy the triumph of the French mechanicians.
<p/>The resonant voice of the Hungarian was about to prevail in ridicule of the spurious lutes of the romantic painters when Segouin shepherded his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) party into politics.
<p/>Jimmy, under generous influences, felt the buried zeal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) father wake to life within him (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) aroused the torpid Routh at last.
<p/>Here was congenial ground for all. The room grew doubly hot and Segouin's task grew harder each moment: there was even danger of personal spite.
<p/>The alert host at an opportunity lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) glass to Humanity and, when the toast had been drunk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) threw open a window significantly.
<p/>That night the city wore the mask of a capital. The five young men strolled along Stephen's Green in a faint cloud of aromatic smoke.
<p/>At the corner of Grafton Street a short fat man was putting two handsome ladies on a car in charge of another fat man.
<p/>They talked loudly and gaily and their cloaks dangled from their shoulders. The people made way for them. The car drove off and the short fat man caught sight of the party.
<p/>'' Andre.'' '' It's Farley! '' A torrent of talk followed. Farley was an American. No one knew very well what the talk was about.
<p/>Villona and Riviere were the noisiest, but all the men were excited. They got up on a car, squeezing themselves together amid much laughter.
<p/>They took the train at Westland Row and in a few seconds, as it seemed to Jimmy, they were walking out of Kingstown Station.
<p/>They drove by the crowd, blended now into soft colours, to a music of merry bells. The ticket-collector saluted Jimmy ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) was an old man: <div class="bookquote">``Fine night, sir!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>an man night</b></font>)</div>It was a serene summer night; the harbour lay like a darkened mirror at their feet. They proceeded towards it with linked arms, singing Cadet Roussel in chorus, stamping their feet at every:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho! Ho! Hohe, vraiment! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cadet</b></font>)</div>They got into a rowboat at the slip and made out for the American's yacht. There was to be supper, music, cards.
<p/>Villona said with conviction: <div class="bookquote">``It is delightful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Villona</b></font>)</div>There was a yacht piano in the cabin. Villona played a waltz for Farley and Riviere, Farley acting as cavalier and Riviere as lady.
<p/>Then an impromptu square dance, the men devising original figures. What merriment! Jimmy took his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) part with a will; this was seeing life, at least.
<p/>Then Farley got out of breath and cried <div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>Farley</b></font>)</div>A man brought in a light supper, and the young men sat down to it for form's sake.
<p/>They drank, however: it was Bohemian. They drank Ireland, England, France, Hungary, the United States of America. Jimmy made a speech, a long speech, Villona saying: <div class="bookquote">``Hear! hear!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Villona</b></font>)</div>whenever there was a pause. There was a great clapping of hands when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) sat down. It must have been a good speech.
<p/>Farley clapped him (<font color='blue'><b>Farley</b></font>) on the back and laughed loudly. What jovial fellows! What good company they were! Cards! cards! The table was cleared.
<p/>Villona returned quietly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Farley</b></font>) piano and played voluntaries for them. The other men played game after game, flinging themselves boldly into the adventure.
<p/>They drank the health of the Queen of Hearts and of the Queen of Diamonds. Jimmy felt obscurely the lack of an audience: the wit was flashing.
<p/>Play ran very high and paper began to pass. Jimmy did not know exactly who was winning but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) was losing.
<p/>But it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) own fault for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) frequently mistook his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) cards and the other men had to calculate his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) I.O.U.'s for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>).
<p/>They were devils of fellows but he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) wished they would stop: it was getting late. Someone gave the toast of the yacht
<p/>The Belle of Newport and then someone proposed one great game for a finish. The piano had stopped; Villona must have gone up on deck.
<p/>It was a terrible game. They stopped just before the end of it to drink for luck. Jimmy understood that the game lay between Routh and Segouin.
<p/>What excitement! Jimmy was excited too; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) would lose, of course. How much had he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) written away? The men rose to their feet to play the last tricks.
<p/>talking and gesticulating. Routh won. The cabin shook with the young men's cheering and the cards were bundled together. They began then to gather in what they had won.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Routh</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Routh</b></font>) would regret in the morning but at present he (<font color='blue'><b>Routh</b></font>) was glad of the rest, glad of the dark stupor that would cover up his (<font color='blue'><b>Routh</b></font>) folly.
<p/>Farley and Jimmy were the heaviest losers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Farley</b></font>) leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Farley</b></font>) elbows on the table and rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Farley</b></font>) head between his (<font color='blue'><b>Farley</b></font>) hands, counting the beats of his (<font color='blue'><b>Farley</b></font>) temples.
<p/>TWO GALLANTS THE grey warm evening of August had descended upon the city and a mild warm air, a memory of summer, circulated in the streets.
<p/>The cabin door opened and he (<font color='blue'><b>Farley</b></font>) saw the Hungarian standing in a shaft of grey light: <div class="bookquote">``Daybreak, gentlemen! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The streets, shuttered for the repose of Sunday, swarmed with a gaily coloured crowd.
<p/>Like illumined pearls the lamps shone from the summits of their tall poles upon the living texture below which, changing shape and hue unceasingly, sent up into the warm grey evening air an unchanging unceasing murmur.
<p/>Two young men came down the hill of Rutland Square. One of them was just bringing a long monologue to a close.
<p/>The other, who walked on the verge of the path and was at times obliged to step on to the road, owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) companion's rudeness, wore an amused listening face.
<p/>A yachting cap was shoved far back from his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) forehead and the narrative to which he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) listened made constant waves of expression break forth over his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) face from the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) nose and eyes and mouth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was squat and ruddy. Little jets of wheezing laughter followed one another out of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) convulsed body. His (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) eyes, twinkling with cunning enjoyment, glanced at every moment towards his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) companion's face.
<p/>Once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) rearranged the light waterproof which he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had slung over one shoulder in toreador fashion. His (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) breeches, his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) white rubber shoes and his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) jauntily slung waterproof expressed youth.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) figure fell into rotundity at the waist, his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hair was scant and grey and his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) face, when the waves of expression had passed over it, had a ravaged look.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was quite sure that the narrative had ended he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) laughed noiselessly for fully half a minute. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Well!...
<p/>That takes the biscuit!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) voice seemed winnowed of vigour; and to enforce his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) words he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) added with humour: <div class="bookquote">``That takes the solitary, unique, and, if I may so call it, recherche biscuit!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) became serious and silent when he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had said this. His (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) tongue was tired for he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had been talking all the afternoon in a public-house in Dorset Street.
<p/>but, in spite of this reputation, his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) adroitness and eloquence had always prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) friends from forming any general policy against him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had a brave manner of coming up to a party of them in a bar and of holding himself nimbly at the borders of the company until he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was included in a round.
<p/>Most people considered Lenehan a leech He (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) was a sporting vagrant armed with a vast stock of stories, limericks and riddles.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) was insensitive to all kinds of discourtesy. No one knew how he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) achieved the stern task of living, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) name was vaguely associated with racing tissues.
<p/>'' And where did you pick her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) up, Corley? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) asked. Corley ran his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) tongue swiftly along his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) upper lip.
<p/>One night, man,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I was going along Dame Street and I spotted a fine tart under Waterhouse's clock and said good-night, you know.
<p/>So we went for a walk round by the canal and she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) told me she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was a slavey in a house in Baggot Street.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I put my arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) and squeezed her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) a bit that night. Then next Sunday, man, I met her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) by appointment.
<p/>We went out to Donnybrook and I brought her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) into a field there. She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) told me she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) used to go with a dairyman....
<p/>It was fine, man. Cigarettes every night she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)'d bring me and paying the tram out and back. And one night she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) brought me two bloody fine cigars--
<p/>O, the real cheese, you know, that the old fellow used to smoke.... I was afraid, man, she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)'d get in the family way.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)'s up to the dodge. '' '' Maybe she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) thinks you'll marry her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>),'' said Lenehan. '' I told her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) I was out of a job,'' said Corley.
<p/>'' I told her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) I was in Pim's. She (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) doesn't know my name. I was too hairy to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) that.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) thinks I'm a bit of class, you know. '' Lenehan laughed again, noiselessly. '' Of all the good ones ever I heard,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that emphatically takes the biscuit.
<p/>The swing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) burly body made his (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) friend execute a few light skips from the path to the roadway and back again.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Corley's stride acknowledged the compliment. Corley was the son of an inspector of police and he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) had inherited his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) father's frame and gait.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) head was large, globular and oily; it sweated in all weathers; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) large round hat, set upon it sideways, looked like a bulb which had grown out of another.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) always stared straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) were on parade and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) wished to gaze after someone in the street, it was necessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) to move his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) body from the hips.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) walked with his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) hands by his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) sides, holding himself erect and swaying his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) head from side to side. At present he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) was about town.
<p/>Whenever any job was vacant a friend was always ready to give him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) the hard word. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was often to be seen walking with policemen in plain clothes, talking earnestly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knew the inner side of all affairs and was fond of delivering final judgments. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) spoke without listening to the speech of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) companions.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) conversation was mainly about himself: what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had said to such a person and what such a person had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) and what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had said to settle the matter.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) reported these dialogues he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) aspirated the first letter of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) name after the manner of Florentines. Lenehan offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) friend a cigarette.
<p/>As the two young men walked on through the crowd Corley occasionally turned to smile at some of the passing girls
<p/>but Lenehan's gaze was fixed on the large faint moon circled with a double halo. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) watched earnestly the passing of the grey web of twilight across its face.
<p/>At length he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Well... tell me, Corley, I suppose you'll be able to pull it off all right, eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Corley closed one eye expressively as an answer.
<p/>'' Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Florentines</b></font>) game for that?'' asked Lenehan dubiously. '' You can never know women.'' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Florentines</b></font>)'s all right,'' said Corley.
<p/>'' I know the way to get around her (<font color='blue'><b>Florentines</b></font>), man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Florentines</b></font>)'s a bit gone on me.'' '' You're what I call a gay Lothario,'' said Lenehan.
<p/>'' And the proper kind of a Lothario, too!'' A shade of mockery relieved the servility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) manner. To save himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) had the habit of leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) flattery open to the interpretation of raillery.
<p/>But Corley had not a subtle mind. '' There's nothing to touch a good slavey,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) affirmed. <div class="bookquote">``Take my tip for it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lenehan</b></font>)</div><p/>'' By one who has tried them all,'' said Lenehan. '' First I used to go with girls, you know,'' said Corley, unbosoming; <div class="bookquote">``girls off the South Circular.
<p/>I used to take them out, man, on the tram somewhere and pay the tram or take them to a band or a play at the theatre or buy them chocolate and sweets or something that way.
<p/>I used to spend money on them right enough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Corley</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) added, in a convincing tone, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) was conscious of being disbelieved.
<p/>But Lenehan could well believe it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) nodded gravely. '' I know that game,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and it's a mug's game.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And damn the thing I ever got out of it,'' said Corley. <div class="bookquote">``Ditto here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lenehan</b></font>)</div>said Lenehan. '' Only off of one of them,'' said Corley.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) moistened his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) upper lip by running his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) tongue along it. The recollection brightened his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) too gazed at the pale disc of the moon, now nearly veiled, and seemed to meditate.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) was... a bit of all right,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) said regretfully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) was silent again. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>)'s on the turf now.
<p/>I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) driving down Earl Street one night with two fellows with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) on a car. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I suppose that's your doing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lenehan</b></font>)</div>said Lenehan.
<p/>'' There was others at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) before me,'' said Corley philosophically. This time Lenehan was inclined to disbelieve. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) head to and fro and smiled.
<p/>'' You know you can't kid me, Corley,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) said. '' Honest to God!'' said Corley. '' Didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) tell me herself?''
<p/>As they passed along the railings of Trinity College, Lenehan skipped out into the road and peered up at the clock.
<p/>Lenehan made a tragic gesture. '' Base betrayer! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) said. '' Twenty after,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) said. '' Time enough,'' said Corley.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>College</b></font>)'ll be there all right. I always let her (<font color='blue'><b>College</b></font>) wait a bit. '' Lenehan laughed quietly. '' Ecod! Corley, you know how to take them,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' I'm up to all their little tricks,'' Corley confessed. '' But tell me,'' said Lenehan again, <div class="bookquote">``are you sure you can bring it off
<p/>all right? You know it's a ticklish job. They're damn close on that point. Eh? ... What? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lenehan</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) bright, small eyes searched his (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) companion's face for reassurance.
<p/>Corley swung his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) head to and fro as if to toss aside an insistent insect, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) brows gathered. '' I'll pull it off,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) said.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) did not wish to ruffle his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) friend's temper, to be sent to the devil and told that his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) advice was not wanted.
<p/>'' Leave it to me, can't you?'' Lenehan said no more. A little tact was necessary. But Corley's brow was soon smooth again.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) thoughts were running another way. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)'s a fine decent tart,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) said, with appreciation; <div class="bookquote">``that's what she (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) is. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Not far from the porch of the club a harpist stood in the roadway, playing to a little ring of listeners.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) plucked at the wires heedlessly, glancing quickly from time to time at the face of each new-comer and from time to time, wearily also, at the sky.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) harp, too, heedless that her (<font color='blue'><b>harpist</b></font>) coverings had fallen about her (<font color='blue'><b>harpist</b></font>) knees, seemed weary alike of the eyes of strangers and of her (<font color='blue'><b>harpist</b></font>) master's hands.
<p/>One hand played in the bass the melody of Silent, O Moyle, while the other hand careered in the treble after each group of notes.
<p/>They walked along Nassau Street and then turned into Kildare Street. The notes of the air sounded deep and full. The two young men walked up the street without speaking, the mournful music following them.
<p/>When they reached Stephen's Green they crossed the road. Here the noise of trams, the lights and the crowd released them from their silence.
<p/>'' There she (<font color='blue'><b>harpist</b></font>) is!'' said Corley. At the corner of Hume Street a young woman was standing. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wore a blue dress and a white sailor hat.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood on the curbstone, swinging a sunshade in one hand. Lenehan grew lively. <div class="bookquote">``Let's have a look at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), Corley,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) said.
<p/>Corley glanced sideways at his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) friend and an unpleasant grin appeared on his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) face. '' Are you trying to get inside me?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) asked. '' Damn it! '' said Lenehan boldly, <div class="bookquote">``I don't want an introduction. All I want is to have a look at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>I'm not going to eat her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Lenehan</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O... A look at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Corley</b></font>)</div>said Corley, more amiably. '' Well... I'll tell you what.
<p/>I'll go over and talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and you can pass by.'' <div class="bookquote">``Right!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lenehan</b></font>)</div>said Lenehan. Corley had already thrown one leg over the chains when Lenehan called out:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And after? Where will we meet? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lenehan</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Half ten,''  (<font color='red'><b>Corley</b></font>)</div>answered Corley, bringing over his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) other leg. '' Where?'' <div class="bookquote">``Corner of Merrion Street.
<p/>We'll be coming back.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Work it all right now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lenehan</b></font>)</div>said Lenehan in farewell. Corley did not answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) sauntered across the road swaying his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) head from side to side.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) bulk, his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) easy pace, and the solid sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) boots had something of the conqueror in them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) approached the young woman and, without saluting, began at once to converse with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) swung her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) umbrella more quickly and executed half turns on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heels. Once or twice when he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at close quarters she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) laughed and bent her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head.
<p/>Lenehan observed them for a few minutes. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) walked rapidly along beside the chains at some distance and crossed the road obliquely.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) approached Hume Street corner he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) found the air heavily scented and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) eyes made a swift anxious scrutiny of the young woman's appearance.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Sunday finery on. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) blue serge skirt was held at the waist by a belt of black leather.
<p/>The great silver buckle of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) belt seemed to depress the centre of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) body, catching the light stuff of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) white blouse like a clip.
<p/>The ends of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tulle collarette had been carefully disordered and a big bunch of red flowers was pinned in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bosomm stems upwards.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wore a short black jacket with mother-of-pearl buttons and a ragged black boa. Lenehan's eyes noted approvingly her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stout short muscular body.
<p/>Frank rude health glowed in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fat red cheeks and in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) unabashed blue eyes. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) features were blunt.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had broad nostrils, a straggling mouth which lay open in a contented leer, and two projecting front teeth. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) passed Lenehan took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) cap and, after about ten seconds, Corley returned a salute to the air.
<p/>This he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) did by raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) hand vaguely and pensively changing the angle of position of his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) hat. Lenehan walked as far as the Shelbourne Hotel where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) halted and waited.
<p/>After waiting for a little time he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) saw them coming towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) and, when they turned to the right, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) followed them, stepping lightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) white shoes, down one side of Merrion Square.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) walked on slowly, timing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) pace to theirs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) watched Corley's head which turned at every moment towards the young woman's face like a big ball revolving on a pivot.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) kept the pair in view until he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) had seen them climbing the stairs of the Donnybrook tram; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) turned about and went back the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) had come.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) gaiety seemed to forsake him (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) came by the railings of the Duke's Lawn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) hand to run along them.
<p/>Now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) was alone his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) face looked older. The air which the harpist had played began to control his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) movements.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) softly padded feet played the melody while his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) fingers swept a scale of variations idly along the railings after each group of notes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) walked listlessly round Stephen's Green and then down Grafton Street. Though his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) eyes took note of many elements of the crowd through which he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) passed they did so morosely.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) found trivial all that was meant to charm him (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) and did not answer the glances which invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) to be bold.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) would have to speak a great deal, to invent and to amuse, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) brain and throat were too dry for such a task.
<p/>The problem of how he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) could pass the hours till he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) met Corley again troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) a little. He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) could think of no way of passing them but to keep on walking.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) turned to the left when he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) came to the corner of Rutland Square and felt more at ease in the dark quiet street, the sombre look of which suited his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) mood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) paused at last before the window of a poor-looking shop over which the words Refreshment Bar were printed in white letters.
<p/>A cut ham was exposed on a great blue dish while near it on a plate lay a segment of very light plum-pudding.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) eyed this food earnestly for some time and then, after glancing warily up and down the street, went into the shop quickly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) was hungry for, except some biscuits which he (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) had asked two grudging curates to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) had eaten nothing since breakfast-time.
<p/>On the glass of the window were two flying inscriptions: Ginger Beer and Ginger Ale. He (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) sat down at an uncovered wooden table opposite two work-girls and a mechanic.
<p/>A slatternly girl waited on him (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>). '' How much is a plate of peas? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) asked. '' Three halfpence, sir,'' said the girl.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) spoke roughly in order to belie his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) air of gentility for his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) entry had been followed by a pause of talk.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bring me a plate of peas,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and a bottle of ginger beer. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) face was heated. To appear natural he (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) cap back on his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) head and planted his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) elbows on the table.
<p/>The girl brought him (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) a plate of grocer's hot peas, seasoned with pepper and vinegar, a fork and his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) ginger beer.
<p/>The mechanic and the two work-girls examined him (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) point by point before resuming their conversation in a subdued voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) ate his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) food greedily and found it so good that he (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) made a note of the shop mentally.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) had eaten all the peas he (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) sipped his (<font color='blue'><b>ham</b></font>) ginger beer and sat for some time thinking of Corley's adventure.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) imagination he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) beheld the pair of lovers walking along some dark road; he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) heard Corley's voice in deep energetic gallantries and saw again the leer of the young woman's mouth.
<p/>This vision made him (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) feel keenly his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) own poverty of purse and spirit. He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) was tired of knocking about, of pulling the devil by the tail, of shifts and intrigues.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) would be thirty-one in November. Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) never get a good job? Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) never have a home of his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) own?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) thought how pleasant it would be to have a warm fire to sit by and a good dinner to sit down to.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) had walked the streets long enough with friends and with girls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) knew what those friends were worth: he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) knew the girls too.
<p/>Experience had embittered his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) heart against the world. But all hope had not left him (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) felt better after having eaten than he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) had felt before, less weary of his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) life, less vanquished in spirit.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) might yet be able to settle down in some snug corner and live happily if he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) could only come across some good simple-minded girl with a little of the ready.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) paid twopence halfpenny to the slatternly girl and went out of the shop to begin his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) wandering again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) went into Capel Street and walked along towards the City Hall.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) turned into Dame Street. At the corner of George's Street he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) met two friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) and stopped to converse with them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could rest from all his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) walking. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) friends asked him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) seen Corley and what was the latest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had spent the day with Corley. His (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) friends talked very little. They looked vacantly after some figures in the crowd and sometimes made a critical remark.
<p/>One said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) had seen Mac an hour before in Westmoreland Street. At this Lenehan said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) had been with Mac the night before in Egan's.
<p/>The young man who had seen Mac in Westmoreland Street asked was it true that Mac had won a bit over a billiard match.
<p/>Lenehan did not know: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) said that Holohan had stood them drinks in Egan's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Egan</b></font>) left his (<font color='blue'><b>Egan</b></font>) friends at a quarter to ten and went up George's Street.
<p/>The crowd of girls and young men had thinned and on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) way up the street he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) heard many groups and couples bidding one another good-night.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) turned to the left at the City Markets and walked on into Grafton Street. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) went as far as the clock of the College of Surgeons: it was on the stroke of ten.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) reached the corner of Merrion Street he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) stand in the shadow of a lamp and brought out one of the cigarettes which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had reserved and lit it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) leaned against the lamp-post and kept his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) gaze fixed on the part from which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) expected to see Corley and the young woman return.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) set off briskly along the northern side of the Green hurrying for fear Corley should return too soon. His (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) mind became active again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) wondered had Corley managed it successfully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) yet or if he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) would leave it to the last.
<p/>But the memory of Corley's slowly revolving head calmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) somewhat: he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) was sure Corley would pull it off all right.
<p/>All at once the idea struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) that perhaps Corley had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) home by another way and given him (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) the slip.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) suffered all the pangs and thrills of his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) friend's situation as well as those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) own. His (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) eyes searched the street: there was no sign of them.
<p/>Yet it was surely half-an-hour since he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) had seen the clock of the College of Surgeons. Would Corley do a thing like that?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) lit his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) last cigarette and began to smoke it nervously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) strained his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) eyes as each tram stopped at the far corner of the square.
<p/>They must have gone home by another way. The paper of his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) cigarette broke and he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) flung it into the road with a curse.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) saw them coming towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) started with delight and, keeping close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) lamp-post, tried to read the result in their walk.
<p/>They were walking quickly, the young woman taking quick short steps, while Corley kept beside her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) long stride. They did not seem to be speaking.
<p/>An intimation of the result pricked him (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) like the point of a sharp instrument. He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) knew Corley would fail; he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) knew it was no go.
<p/>They turned down Baggot Street and he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) followed them at once, taking the other footpath. When they stopped he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) stopped too.
<p/>They talked for a few moments and then the young woman went down the steps into the area of a house.
<p/>Corley remained standing at the edge of the path, a little distance from the front steps. Some minutes passed. Then the hall-door was opened slowly and cautiously.
<p/>A woman came running down the front steps and coughed. Corley turned and went towards her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) broad figure hid hers from view for a few seconds and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reappeared running up the steps.
<p/>The door closed on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and Corley began to walk swiftly towards Stephen's Green. Lenehan hurried on in the same direction.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) took them as a warning and, glancing back towards the house which the young woman had entered to see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) was not observed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) ran eagerly across the road.
<p/>Some drops of light rain fell. Anxiety and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) swift run made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) pant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) called out: <div class="bookquote">``Hallo, Corley! ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Corley turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) head to see who had called him (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>), and then continued walking as before.
<p/>Lenehan ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>), settling the waterproof on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) shoulders with one hand. '' Hallo, Corley! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) cried again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) came level with his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) friend and looked keenly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) could see nothing there. '' Well?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) said. '' Did it come off? '' They had reached the corner of Ely Place.
<p/>Still without answering, Corley swerved to the left and went up the side street. His (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) features were composed in stern calm.
<p/>Lenehan kept up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) friend, breathing uneasily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) was baffled and a note of menace pierced through his (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) voice. ''
<p/>Can't you tell us? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lenehan</b></font>) said. '' Did you try her (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)?'' Corley halted at the first lamp and stared grimly before him (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>).
<p/>Then with a grave gesture he (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) extended a hand towards the light and, smiling, opened it slowly to the gaze of his (<font color='blue'><b>Corley</b></font>) disciple.
<p/>A small gold coin shone in the palm. THE BOARDING HOUSE MRS. MOONEY was a butcher's daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>MOONEY</b></font>) was a woman who was quite able to keep things to herself: a determined woman.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had married her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father's foreman and opened a butcher's shop near Spring Gardens. But as soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) father-in-law was dead Mr. Mooney began to go to the devil.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) drank, plundered the till, ran headlong into debt. It was no use making him (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) take the pledge: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) was sure to break out again a few days after.
<p/>By fighting his (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) wife in the presence of customers and by buying bad meat he (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) ruined his (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) business. One night he (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) went for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) wife with the cleaver and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had to sleep in a neighbour's house.
<p/>After that they lived apart. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) went to the priest and got a separation from him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) with care of the children.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would give him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) neither money nor food nor house-room; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was obliged to enlist himself as a sheriff's man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was a shabby stooped little drunkard with a white face and a white moustache and white eyebrows, pencilled above his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) little eyes, which were pink-veined and raw; and all day long he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) sat in the bailiff's room, waiting to be put on a job.
<p/>Mrs. Mooney, who had taken what remained of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) money out of the butcher business and set up a boarding house in Hardwicke Street, was a big imposing woman.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) house had a floating population made up of tourists from Liverpool and the Isle of Man and, occasionally, artistes from the music halls.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) governed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) house cunningly and firmly, knew when to give credit, when to be stern and when to let things pass.
<p/>Its resident population was made up of clerks from the city. All the resident young men spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as The Madam.
<p/>Mrs. Mooney's young men paid fifteen shillings a week for board and lodgings -LRB-beer or stout at dinner excluded-RRB-. They shared in common tastes and occupations and for this reason they were very chummy with one another.
<p/>Jack Mooney, the Madam's son, who was clerk to a commission agent in Fleet Street, had the reputation of being a hard case.
<p/>They discussed with one another the chances of favourites and outsiders. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) was fond of using soldiers' obscenities: usually he (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) came home in the small hours.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) friends he (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) had always a good one to tell them and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) was always sure to be on to a good thing--that is to say, a likely horse or a likely artiste.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>artiste</b></font>) was also handy with the mits and sang comic songs. On Sunday nights there would often be a reunion in Mrs. Mooney's front drawing-room.
<p/>The music-hall artistes would oblige; and Sheridan played waltzes and polkas and vamped accompaniments. Polly Mooney, the Madam's daughter, would also sing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) sang: I'm a... naughty girl. You needn't sham : You know I am. Polly was a slim girl of nineteen; she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) had light soft hair and a small full mouth.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) eyes, which were grey with a shade of green through them, had a habit of glancing upwards when she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) spoke with anyone, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) look like a little perverse madonna.
<p/>Mrs. Mooney had first sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) daughter to be a typist in a corn-factor's office but, as a disreputable sheriff's man used to come every other day to the office, asking to be allowed to say a word to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) daughter home again and set her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to do housework.
<p/>As Polly was very lively the intention was to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) the run of the young men. Besides, young men like to feel that there is a young woman not very far away.
<p/>Polly, of course, flirted with the young men but Mrs. Mooney, who was a shrewd judge, knew that the young men were only passing the time away: none of them meant business.
<p/>Things went on so for a long time and Mrs. Mooney began to think of sending Polly back to typewriting when she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) noticed that something was going on between Polly and one of the young men.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) watched the pair and kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) own counsel. Polly knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) was being watched, but still her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) mother's persistent silence could not be misunderstood.
<p/>There had been no open complicity between mother and daughter, no open understanding but, though people in the house began to talk of the affair, still Mrs. Mooney did not intervene.
<p/>Polly began to grow a little strange in her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) manner and the young man was evidently perturbed. At last, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) judged it to be the right moment, Mrs. Mooney intervened.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) dealt with moral problems as a cleaver deals with meat: and in this case she (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) mind.
<p/>All the windows of the boarding house were open and the lace curtains ballooned gently towards the street beneath the raised sashes.
<p/>The belfry of George's Church sent out constant peals and worshippers, singly or in groups, traversed the little circus before the church, revealing their purpose by their self-contained demeanour no less than by the little volumes in their gloved hands.
<p/>Breakfast was over in the boarding house and the table of the breakfast-room was covered with plates on which lay yellow streaks of eggs with morsels of bacon-fat and bacon-rind.
<p/>It was a bright Sunday morning of early summer, promising heat, but with a fresh breeze blowing. Mrs. Mooney sat in the straw arm-chair and watched the servant Mary remove the breakfast things.
<p/>When the table was cleared, the broken bread collected, the sugar and butter safe under lock and key, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to reconstruct the interview which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had had the night before with Polly.
<p/>Things were as she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) had suspected: she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) had been frank in her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) questions and Polly had been frank in her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) answers.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) made Mary collect the crusts and pieces of broken bread to help to make Tuesday's bread-pudding. Both had been somewhat awkward, of course.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been made awkward by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) not wishing to receive the news in too cavalier a fashion or to seem to have connived and Polly had been made awkward not merely because allusions of that kind always made her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) awkward but also because she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) did not wish it to be thought that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) wise innocence she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) had divined the intention behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) mother's tolerance.
<p/>Mrs. Mooney glanced instinctively at the little gilt clock on the mantelpiece as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) had become aware through her (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) revery that the bells of George's Church had stopped ringing.
<p/>It was seventeen minutes past eleven: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) would have lots of time to have the matter out with Mr. Doran and then catch short twelve at Marlborough Street.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) would win. To begin with she (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) had all the weight of social opinion on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) side: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) was an outraged mother.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) had allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) to live beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) roof, assuming that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) was a man of honour, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) had simply abused her (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) hospitality.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) was thirty-four or thirty-five years of age, so that youth could not be pleaded as his (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) excuse; nor could ignorance be his (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) excuse since he (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) was a man who had seen something of the world.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) had simply taken advantage of Polly's youth and inexperience: that was evident. The question was: What reparation would he (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) make?
<p/>It is all very well for the man: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can go his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ways as if nothing had happened, having had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moment of pleasure, but the girl has to bear the brunt.
<p/>Some mothers would be content to patch up such an affair for a sum of money; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had known cases of it.
<p/>There must be reparation made in such cases. But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would not do so. For her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) only one reparation could make up for the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) daughter's honour: marriage.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) counted all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cards again before sending Mary up to Mr. Doran's room to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wished to speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt sure she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would win. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) was a serious young man, not rakish or loud-voiced like the others. If it had been Mr. Sheridan or Mr. Meade or Bantam Lyons
<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) task would have been much harder. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) would face publicity. All the lodgers in the house knew something of the affair; details had been invented by some.
<p/>Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) had been employed for thirteen years in a great Catholic wine-merchant's office and publicity would mean for him (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>), perhaps, the loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) job.
<p/>Whereas if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) agreed all might be well. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) had a good screw for one thing and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) suspected he (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) had a bit of stuff put by.
<p/>The decisive expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) great florid face satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought of some mothers she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew who could not get their daughters off their hands.
<p/>Nearly the half-hour! She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stood up and surveyed herself in the pier-glass. Mr. Doran was very anxious indeed this Sunday morning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) had made two attempts to shave but his (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) hand had been so unsteady that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) had been obliged to desist.
<p/>Three days' reddish beard fringed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) jaws and every two or three minutes a mist gathered on his (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) glasses so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) had to take them off and polish them with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief.
<p/>The recollection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) confession of the night before was a cause of acute pain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>); the priest had drawn out every ridiculous detail of the affair and in the end had so magnified his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) sin that he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was almost thankful at being afforded a loophole of reparation.
<p/>The harm was done. What could he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) do now but marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) or run away? He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) could not brazen it out.
<p/>The affair would be sure to be talked of and his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) employer would be certain to hear of it. Dublin is such a small city: everyone knows everyone else's business.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) heart leap warmly in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) throat as he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) heard in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) excited imagination old Mr. Leonard calling out in his (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) rasping voice:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Send Mr. Doran here, please. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Leonard</b></font>)</div>All his (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) long years of service gone for nothing! All his (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) industry and diligence thrown away!
<p/>As a young man he (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) had sown his (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) wild oats, of course; he (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) had boasted of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) free-thinking and denied the existence of God to his (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) companions in public-houses.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) still bought a copy of Reynolds's Newspaper every week but he (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) attended to his (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) religious duties and for nine-tenths of the year lived a regular life.
<p/>But that was all passed and done with... nearly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) had money enough to settle down on; it was not that.
<p/>But the family would look down on her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). First of all there was her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) disreputable father and then her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother's boarding house was beginning to get a certain fame.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had a notion that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was being had. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could imagine his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friends talking of the affair and laughing. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a little vulgar; some times she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``I seen''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``If I had've known.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But what would grammar matter if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) really loved her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not make up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind whether to like her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) or despise her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for what she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done.
<p/>Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had done it too. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) instinct urged him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to remain free, not to marry. Once you are married you are done for, it said.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was sitting helplessly on the side of the bed in shirt and trousers she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tapped lightly at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) door and entered.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) all, that she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made a clean breast of it to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother and that her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother would speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that morning.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried and threw her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) neck, saying: <div class="bookquote">``O Bob! Bob! What am I to do? What am I to do at all?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would put an end to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feebly, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not to cry, that it would be all right, never fear.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) remembered well, with the curious patient memory of the celibate, the first casual caresses her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dress, her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breath, her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) felt against his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) shirt the agitation of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bosom. It was not altogether his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) fault that it had happened. Then late one night as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was undressing for bed she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had tapped at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) door, timidly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to relight her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) candle at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) for hers had been blown out by a gust. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bath night.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore a loose open combing-jacket of printed flannel. Her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) white instep shone in the opening of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) furry slippers and the blood glowed warmly behind her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) perfumed skin.
<p/>From her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands and wrists too as she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lit and steadied her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) candle a faint perfume arose. On nights when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) came in very late it was she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who warmed up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) dinner.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) scarcely knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was eating, feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) alone, at night, in the sleeping house. And her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughtfulness!
<p/>If the night was anyway cold or wet or windy there was sure to be a little tumbler of punch ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>).
<p/>Perhaps they could be happy together.... They used to go upstairs together on tiptoe, each with a candle, and on the third landing exchange reluctant good-nights.
<p/>They used to kiss. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) remembered well her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, the touch of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) delirium.... But delirium passes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) echoed her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) phrase, applying it to himself: <div class="bookquote">``What am I to do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>But the sin was there; even his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) sense of honour told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) that reparation must be made for such a sin.
<p/>The instinct of the celibate warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) to hold back. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on the side of the bed
<p/>Mary came to the door and said that the missus wanted to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) in the parlour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) stood up to put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) coat and waistcoat, more helpless than ever.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) was dressed he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) went over to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It would be all right, never fear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crying on the bed and moaning softly:
<p/>'' Going down the stairs his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) glasses became so dimmed with moisture that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) had to take them off and polish them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) longed to ascend through the roof and fly away to another country where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) would never hear again of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) trouble, and yet a force pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) downstairs step by step.
<p/>On the last flight of stairs he (<font color='blue'><b>Bob</b></font>) passed Jack Mooney who was coming up from the pantry nursing two bottles of Bass.
<p/>They saluted coldly; and the lover's eyes rested for a second or two on a thick bulldog face and a pair of thick short arms.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) reached the foot of the staircase he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) glanced up and saw Jack regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) from the door of the return-room.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) remembered the night when one of the music-hall artistes, a little blond Londoner, had made a rather free allusion to Polly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O my God! The implacable faces of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) employer and of the Madam stared upon his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) discomfiture. The reunion had been almost broken up on account of Jack's violence.
<p/>The music-hall artiste, a little paler than usual, kept smiling and saying that there was no harm meant: but Jack kept shouting at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) that if any fellow tried that sort of a game on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) sister he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>)'d bloody well put his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) teeth down his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) throat, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would.
<p/>Everyone tried to quiet him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). Polly sat for a little time on the side of the bed, crying. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) dried her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) eyes and went over to the looking-glass.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) dipped the end of the towel in the water-jug and refreshed her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) eyes with the cool water. She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) looked at herself in profile and readjusted a hairpin above her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) ear.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) went back to the bed again and sat at the foot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) regarded the pillows for a long time and the sight of them awakened in her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) mind secret, amiable memories.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) rested the nape of her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) neck against the cool iron bed-rail and fell into a reverie. There was no longer any perturbation visible on her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) face.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) hopes and visions were so intricate that she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) no longer saw the white pillows on which her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) gaze was fixed or remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) was waiting for anything.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) waited on patiently, almost cheerfully, without alarm, her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) memories gradually giving place to hopes and visions of the future. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) mother calling.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) started to her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) feet and ran to the banisters. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Polly</b></font>)</div>Polly! Polly!'' '' Yes, mamma?'' <div class="bookquote">``Come down, dear. Mr. Doran wants to speak to you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) remembered what she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) had been waiting for. A LITTLE CLOUD EIGHT years before he (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) friend off at the North Wall and wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Doran</b></font>) godspeed.
<p/>Gallaher had got on. You could tell that at once by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) travelled air, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent.
<p/>Few fellows had talents like his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) and fewer still could remain unspoiled by such success. Gallaher's heart was in the right place and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) had deserved to win.
<p/>Little Chandler's thoughts ever since lunch-time had been of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) meeting with Gallaher, of Gallaher's invitation and of the great city London where Gallaher lived.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) was called Little Chandler because, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) was but slightly under the average stature, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) gave one the idea of being a little man.
<p/>It was something to have a friend like that. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hands were white and small, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) frame was fragile, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) voice was quiet and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) manners were refined.
<p/>The half-moons of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) nails were perfect and when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) smiled you caught a glimpse of a row of childish white teeth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) took the greatest care of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fair silken hair and moustache and used perfume discreetly on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) handkerchief. As he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sat at his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) desk in the King's Inns he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thought what changes those eight years had brought.
<p/>The friend whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had known under a shabby and necessitous guise had become a brilliant figure on the London Press.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) turned often from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) tiresome writing to gaze out of the office window. The glow of a late autumn sunset covered the grass plots and walks.
<p/>It cast a shower of kindly golden dust on the untidy nurses and decrepit old men who drowsed on the benches; it flickered upon all the moving figures--on the children who ran screaming along the gravel paths and on everyone who passed through the gardens.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) watched the scene and thought of life; and -LRB-as always happened when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thought of life-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) became sad. A gentle melancholy took possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) felt how useless it was to struggle against fortune, this being the burden of wisdom which the ages had bequeathed to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had bought them in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) bachelor days and many an evening, as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sat in the little room off the hall, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been tempted to take one down from the bookshelf and read out something to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) remembered the books of poetry upon his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) shelves at home. But shyness had always held him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) back; and so the books had remained on their shelves.
<p/>At times he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) repeated lines to himself and this consoled him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). When his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hour had struck he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stood up and took leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) desk and of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fellow-clerks punctiliously.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) emerged from under the feudal arch of the King's Inns, a neat modest figure, and walked swiftly down Henrietta Street.
<p/>They stood or ran in the roadway or crawled up the steps before the gaping doors or squatted like mice upon the thresholds.
<p/>The golden sunset was waning and the air had grown sharp. A horde of grimy children populated the street. Little Chandler gave them no thought.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) picked his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) way deftly through all that minute vermin-like life and under the shadow of the gaunt spectral mansions in which the old nobility of Dublin had roystered.
<p/>No memory of the past touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) mind was full of a present joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) had never been in Corless's but he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) knew the value of the name.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) knew that people went there after the theatre to eat oysters and drink liqueurs; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) had heard that the waiters there spoke French and German.
<p/>Walking swiftly by at night he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) had seen cabs drawn up before the door and richly dressed ladies, escorted by cavaliers, alight and enter quickly.
<p/>They wore noisy dresses and many wraps. Their faces were powdered and they caught up their dresses, when they touched earth, like alarmed Atalantas.
<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) habit to walk swiftly in the street even by day and whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) found himself in the city late at night he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) hurried on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) way apprehensively and excitedly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) chose the darkest and narrowest streets and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) walked boldly forward, the silence that was spread about his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) footsteps troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>), the wandering, silent figures troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>); and at times a sound of low fugitive laughter made him (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) tremble like a leaf.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) had always passed without turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) head to look. Sometimes, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) courted the causes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) fear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) turned to the right towards Capel Street.
<p/>Ignatius Gallaher on the London Press! Who would have thought it possible eight years before? Still, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) reviewed the past, Little Chandler could remember many signs of future greatness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) friend.
<p/>Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) did mix with a rakish set of fellows at that time, drank freely and borrowed money on all sides.
<p/>In the end he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) had got mixed up in some shady affair, some money transaction: at least, that was one version of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) flight.
<p/>People used to say that Ignatius Gallaher was wild. But nobody denied him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) talent. There was always a certain... something in Ignatius Gallaher that impressed you in spite of yourself.
<p/>Little Chandler remembered -LRB-and the remembrance brought a slight flush of pride to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) cheek-RRB- one of Ignatius Gallaher's sayings when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) was in a tight corner: <div class="bookquote">``Half time now, boys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) used to say light-heartedly.
<p/>Even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) was out at elbows and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) wits' end for money he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) kept up a bold face. ''
<p/>Where's my considering cap? '' That was Ignatius Gallaher all out; and, damn it, you couldn't but admire him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) for it.
<p/>Little Chandler quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) pace. For the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) felt himself superior to the people he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) passed.
<p/>For the first time his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) soul revolted against the dull inelegance of Capel Street. There was no doubt about it: if you wanted to succeed you had to go away.
<p/>You could do nothing in Dublin. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) crossed Grattan Bridge he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) looked down the river towards the lower quays and pitied the poor stunted houses.
<p/>They seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) a band of tramps, huddled together along the riverbanks, their old coats covered with dust and soot, stupefied by the panorama of sunset and waiting for the first chill of night bid them arise, shake themselves and begone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) wondered whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) could write a poem to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) idea. Perhaps Gallaher might be able to get it into some London paper for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) was not sure what idea he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) wished to express but the thought that a poetic moment had touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) took life within him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) like an infant hope.
<p/>Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) write something original? He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) stepped onward bravely. Every step brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) nearer to London, farther from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) own sober inartistic life.
<p/>A light began to tremble on the horizon of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) was not so old--thirty-two. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) temperament might be said to be just at the point of maturity.
<p/>There were so many different moods and impressions that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) wished to express in verse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) felt them within him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) tried weigh to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) soul to see if it was a poet's soul.
<p/>Melancholy was the dominant note of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) temperament, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) thought, but it was a melancholy tempered by recurrences of faith and resignation and simple joy.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) could give expression to it in a book of poems perhaps men would listen. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) would never be popular: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) saw that.
<p/>The English critics, perhaps, would recognise him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) as one of the Celtic school by reason of the melancholy tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) poems; besides that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) would put in allusions.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) could not sway the crowd but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) might appeal to a little circle of kindred minds. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) began to invent sentences and phrases from the notice which his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) book would get.
<p/>'' Mr. Chandler has the gift of easy and graceful verse. ''... <div class="bookquote">``wistful sadness pervades these poems. '' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>... '' The Celtic note.
<p/>'' It was a pity his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) name was not more Irish-looking. Perhaps it would be better to insert his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) mother's name before the surname:
<p/>Thomas Malone Chandler, or better still: T. Malone Chandler. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) would speak to Gallaher about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) revery so ardently that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) street and had to turn back.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) came near Corless's his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) former agitation began to overmaster him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) halted before the door in indecision. Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) opened the door and entered.
<p/>The light and noise of the bar held him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) at the doorways for a few moments. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>), but his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) sight was confused by the shining of many red and green wine-glasses
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) glanced quickly to right and left -LRB-frowning slightly to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) errand appear serious-RRB-, but when his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) sight cleared a little he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) saw that nobody had turned to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>): and there, sure enough, was Ignatius Gallaher leaning with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) back against the counter and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) feet planted far apart.
<p/>The bar seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) to be full of people and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) felt that the people were observing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) curiously. ''
<p/>Hallo, Tommy, old hero, here you are! What is it to be? What will you have? I'm taking whisky: better stuff than we get across the water.
<p/>Soda? Lithia? No mineral? I'm the same. Spoils the flavour.... Here, garcon, bring us two halves of malt whisky, like a good fellow....
<p/>Well, and how have you been pulling along since I saw you last? Dear God, how old we're getting! Do you see any signs of aging in me--eh, what?
<p/>A little grey and thin on the top--what?'' Ignatius Gallaher took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) hat and displayed a large closely cropped head.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) eyes, which were of bluish slate-colour, relieved his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) unhealthy pallor and shone out plainly above the vivid orange tie he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) wore.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) face was heavy, pale and cleanshaven. Between these rival features the lips appeared very long and shapeless and colourless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) head and felt with two sympathetic fingers the thin hair at the crown.
<p/>Little Chandler shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) head as a denial. Ignatius Galaher put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) hat again. '' It pulls you down,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) said.
<p/>Always hurry and scurry, looking for copy and sometimes not finding it: and then, always to have something new in your stuff.
<p/>'' Press life. Damn proofs and printers, I say, for a few days. I'm deuced glad, I can tell you, to get back to the old country.
<p/>Does a fellow good, a bit of a holiday. I feel a ton better since I landed again in dear dirty Dublin....
<p/>Here you are, Tommy. Water? Say when. '' Little Chandler allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) whisky to be very much diluted. '' You don't know what's good for you, my boy,'' said Ignatius Gallaher.
<p/>'' I drink mine neat.'' <div class="bookquote">``I drink very little as a rule,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chandler/Little Chandler</b></font>)</div>said Little Chandler modestly. '' An odd half-one or so
<p/>when I meet any of the old crowd: that's all. '' <div class="bookquote">``Ah well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ignatius Gallaher/Gallaher</b></font>)</div>said Ignatius Gallaher, cheerfully, <div class="bookquote">``here's to us and to old times and old acquaintance.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ignatius Gallaher/Gallaher</b></font>)</div>They clinked glasses and drank the toast. '' I met some of the old gang today,'' said Ignatius Gallaher. ''
<p/>O'Hara seems to be in a bad way. What's he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) doing?'' <div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chandler/Little Chandler</b></font>)</div>said Little Chandler. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>)'s gone to the dogs.''
<p/>'' But Hogan has a good sit, hasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogan</b></font>)?'' '' Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogan</b></font>)'s in the Land Commission. '' <div class="bookquote">``I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Hogan</b></font>) one night in London and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogan</b></font>) seemed to be very flush....
<p/>Poor O'Hara! Boose, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Other things, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Little</b></font>)</div>said Little Chandler shortly. Ignatius Gallaher laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Tommy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I see you haven't changed an atom.
<p/>You're the very same serious person that used to lecture me on Sunday mornings when I had a sore head and a fur on my tongue.
<p/>You'd want to knock about a bit in the world. Have you never been anywhere even for a trip?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' I've been to the Isle of Man,'' said Little Chandler.
<p/>Ignatius Gallaher laughed. '' The Isle of Man!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) said. '' Go to London or Paris: Paris, for choice. That'd do you good.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Have you seen Paris?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I should think I have! I've knocked about there a little.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And is it really so beautiful as they say?'' asked Little Chandler.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) sipped a little of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) drink while Ignatius Gallaher finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) boldly. <div class="bookquote">``Beautiful?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ignatius Gallaher/Gallaher</b></font>)</div>said Ignatius Gallaher, pausing on the word and on the flavour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) drink.
<p/>'' It's not so beautiful, you know. Of course, it is beautiful.... But it's the life of Paris; that's the thing.
<p/>Ah, there's no city like Paris for gaiety, movement, excitement... '' Little Chandler finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) whisky and, after some trouble, succeeded in catching the barman's eye.
<p/>I've been to the Moulin Rouge,'' Ignatius Gallaher continued when the barman had removed their glasses, <div class="bookquote">``and I've been to all the Bohemian cafes.
<p/>Little Chandler said nothing until the barman returned with two glasses: then he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) friend's glass lightly and reciprocated the former toast.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) ordered the same again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the barman</b></font>)</div>Hot stuff! Not for a pious chap like you, Tommy. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Tommy</b></font>) was beginning to feel somewhat disillusioned.
<p/>Gallaher's accent and way of expressing himself did not please him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>). There was something vulgar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) friend which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) had not observed before.
<p/>But perhaps it was only the result of living in London amid the bustle and competition of the Press. The old personal charm was still there under this new gaudy manner.
<p/>And, after all, Gallaher had lived, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) had seen the world. Little Chandler looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) friend enviously. '' Everything in Paris is gay,'' said Ignatius Gallaher.
<p/>'' They believe in enjoying life--and don't you think they're right? If you want to enjoy yourself properly you must go to Paris.
<p/>And, mind you, they've a great feeling for the Irish there. When they heard I was from Ireland they were ready to eat me, man.
<p/>'' Little Chandler took four or five sips from his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) glass. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``is it true that Paris is so... immoral as they say?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Ignatius Gallaher made a catholic gesture with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) right arm. '' Every place is immoral,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) said. '' Of course you do find spicy bits in Paris.
<p/>Go to one of the students' balls, for instance. That's lively, if you like, when the cocottes begin to let themselves loose.
<p/>You know what they are, I suppose?'' <div class="bookquote">``I've heard of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chandler/Little Chandler</b></font>)</div>said Little Chandler. Ignatius Gallaher drank off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) whisky and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) head.
<p/>'' Ah,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you may say what you like. There's no woman like the Parisienne--for style, for go. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then it is an immoral city,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chandler/Little Chandler</b></font>)</div>said Little Chandler, with timid insistence--<div class="bookquote">``I mean, compared with London or Dublin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Chandler/Little Chandler</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``London!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ignatius Gallaher/Gallaher</b></font>)</div>said Ignatius Gallaher. '' It's six of one and half-a-dozen of the other. You ask Hogan, my boy. I showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hogan</b></font>) a bit about London when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hogan</b></font>) was over there.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hogan</b></font>)'d open your eye.... I say, Tommy, don't make punch of that whisky: liquor up.'' '' No, really...'' <div class="bookquote">``O, come on, another one won't do you any harm.
<p/>What is it? The same again, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well... all right.'' <div class="bookquote">``Francois, the same again.... Will you smoke, Tommy?''  (<font color='red'><b>Ignatius Gallaher/Gallaher</b></font>)</div>Ignatius Gallaher produced his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) cigar-case.
<p/>I'll tell you my opinion,'' said Ignatius Gallaher, emerging after some time from the clouds of smoke in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) had taken refuge, <div class="bookquote">``it's a rum world.
<p/>The two friends lit their cigars and puffed at them in silence until their drinks were served. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Talk of immorality!
<p/>Ignatius Gallaher puffed thoughtfully at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) cigar and then, in a calm historian's tone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) proceeded to sketch for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) friend some pictures of the corruption which was rife abroad.
<p/>I've heard of cases--what am I saying?--I've known them: cases of... immorality...'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) summarised the vices of many capitals and seemed inclined to award the palm to Berlin.
<p/>Some things he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) could not vouch for -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) friends had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>)-RRB-, but of others he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) had had personal experience. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) spared neither rank nor caste.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) revealed many of the secrets of religious houses on the Continent and described some of the practices which were fashionable in high society and ended by telling, with details, a story about an English duchess--a story which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) knew to be true.
<p/>Little Chandler was astonished. '' Ah, well,'' said Ignatius Gallaher, <div class="bookquote">``here we are in old jog-along Dublin where nothing is known of such things.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ignatius Gallaher/Gallaher</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How dull you must find it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chandler/Little Chandler</b></font>)</div>said Little Chandler, <div class="bookquote">``after all the other places you've seen!''  (<font color='red'><b>Chandler/Little Chandler</b></font>)</div>'' Well,'' said Ignatius Gallaher, <div class="bookquote">``it's a relaxation to come over here, you know.
<p/>And, after all, it's the old country, as they say, isn't it? You can't help having a certain feeling for it.
<p/>That's human nature.... But tell me something about yourself. Hogan told me you had... tasted the joys of connubial bliss. Two years ago, wasn't it?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ignatius Gallaher/Gallaher</b></font>)</div>Little Chandler blushed and smiled. '' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) said. '' I was married last May twelve months.'' <div class="bookquote">``I hope it's not too late in the day to offer my best wishes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ignatius Gallaher/Gallaher</b></font>)</div>said Ignatius Gallaher.
<p/>'' I didn't know your address or I'd have done so at the time. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) extended his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) hand, which Little Chandler took.
<p/>,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you and yours every joy in life, old chap, and tons of money, and may you never die till I shoot you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Well, Tommy And that's the wish of a sincere friend, an old friend. You know that?'' '' I know that,'' said Little Chandler.
<p/>'' Any youngsters?'' said Ignatius Gallaher. Little Chandler blushed again. '' We have one child,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) said. '' Son or daughter?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A little boy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ignatius Gallaher/Gallaher</b></font>)</div>Ignatius Gallaher slapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) friend sonorously on the back. '' Bravo,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bravo</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't doubt you, Tommy.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Little Chandler smiled, looked confusedly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) glass and bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) lower lip with three childishly white front teeth. ''
<p/>I hope you'll spend an evening with us,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``before you go back. My wife will be delighted to meet you.
<p/>We can have a little music and-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Thanks awfully, old chap,'' said Ignatius Gallaher, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry we didn't meet earlier.
<p/>You see I'm over here with another fellow, clever young chap he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) is too, and we arranged to go to a little card-party.
<p/>But I must leave tomorrow night.''  (<font color='red'><b>Ignatius Gallaher/Gallaher</b></font>)</div>'' Tonight, perhaps...?'' '' I'm awfully sorry, old man. Only for that... '' <div class="bookquote">``O, in that case...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ignatius Gallaher/Gallaher</b></font>)</div>'' But who knows?'' said Ignatius Gallaher considerately. '' Next year I may take a little skip over here now that I've broken the ice.
<p/>It's only a pleasure deferred.'' <div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chandler/Little Chandler</b></font>)</div>said Little Chandler, <div class="bookquote">``the next time you come we must have an evening together.
<p/>That's agreed now, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Chandler/Little Chandler</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, that's agreed,'' said Ignatius Gallaher. '' Next year if I come, parole d'honneur.'' ''
<p/>And to clinch the bargain,'' said Little Chandler, <div class="bookquote">``we'll just have one more now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Chandler/Little Chandler</b></font>)</div>Ignatius Gallaher took out a large gold watch and looked at it.
<p/>'' Is it to be the last?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) said. '' Because you know, I have an a.p.'' <div class="bookquote">``O, yes, positively,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Little Chandler.
<p/>'' Very well, then,'' said Ignatius Gallaher, <div class="bookquote">``let us have another one as a deoc an doruis --that's good vernacular for a small whisky, I believe.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Ignatius Gallaher/Gallaher</b></font>)</div>Little Chandler ordered the drinks. The blush which had risen to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) face a few moments before was establishing itself.
<p/>Three small whiskies had gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) head and Gallaher's strong cigar had confused his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) mind, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) was a delicate and abstinent person.
<p/>The adventure of meeting Gallaher after eight years, of finding himself with Gallaher in Corless's surrounded by lights and noise, of listening to Gallaher's stories and of sharing for a brief space Gallaher's vagrant and triumphant life, upset the equipoise of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) sensitive nature.
<p/>A trifle made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) blush at any time: and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) felt warm and excited. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) felt acutely the contrast between his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) own life and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) friend's and it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) unjust.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) was sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) could do something better than his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) friend had ever done, or could ever do, something higher than mere tawdry journalism if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) only got the chance.
<p/>Gallaher was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) inferior in birth and education. What was it that stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) way? His (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) unfortunate timidity! He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) wished to vindicate himself in some way, to assert his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) manhood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) saw behind Gallaher's refusal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) invitation. Gallaher was only patronising him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) friendliness just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) was patronising Ireland by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) visit.
<p/>The barman brought their drinks. Little Chandler pushed one glass towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) friend and took up the other boldly. '' Who knows?
<p/>When you come next year I may have the pleasure of wishing long life and happiness to Mr. and Mrs. Ignatius Gallaher.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ignatius</b></font>) said, as they lifted their glasses. '' '' Ignatius Gallaher in the act of drinking closed one eye expressively over the rim of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) glass.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) had drunk he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) smacked his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) lips decisively, set down his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) glass and said: <div class="bookquote">``No blooming fear of that, my boy.
<p/>I'm going to have my fling first and see a bit of life and the world before I put my head in the sack--if I ever do.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Some day you will,'' said Little Chandler calmly. Ignatius Gallaher turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) orange tie and slate-blue eyes full upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) friend.
<p/>'' You think so? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) said. '' You'll put your head in the sack,'' repeated Little Chandler stoutly, ``like everyone else if you can find the girl.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) had slightly emphasised his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) tone and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) was aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) had betrayed himself; but, though the colour had heightened in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) cheek, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) did not flinch from his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) friend's gaze.
<p/>Ignatius Gallaher watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) for a few moments and then said: <div class="bookquote">``If ever it occurs, you may bet your bottom dollar there'll be no mooning and spooning about it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>I mean to marry money. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll have a good fat account at the bank or she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) won't do for me.
<p/>'' Little Chandler shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) head. '' Why, man alive,'' said Ignatius Gallaher, vehemently, <div class="bookquote">``do you know what it is? I've only to say the word and tomorrow
<p/>I can have the woman and the cash. You don't believe it? Well, I know it. There are hundreds--what am I saying?--thousands of rich Germans and Jews, rotten with money, that'd only be too glad....
<p/>You wait a while my boy. See if I don't play my cards properly. When I go about a thing I mean business, I tell you.
<p/>You just wait. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ignatius Gallaher/Gallaher</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tossed his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) glass to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mouth, finished his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) drink and laughed loudly. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked thoughtfully before him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and said in a calmer tone:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But I'm in no hurry. They can wait. I don't fancy tying myself up to one woman, you know. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) imitated with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mouth the act of tasting and made a wry face.
<p/>'' Must get a bit stale, I should think,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said. * * * * * Little Chandler sat in the room off the hall, holding a child in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) arms.
<p/>To save money they kept no servant but Annie's young sister Monica came for an hour or so in the morning and an hour or so in the evening to help.
<p/>Little Chandler had come home late for tea and, moreover, he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) had forgotten to bring Annie home the parcel of coffee from Bewley's.
<p/>But Monica had gone home long ago. It was a quarter to nine. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Monica</b></font>) was in a bad humour and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) short answers.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Monica</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Monica</b></font>) would do without any tea but when it came near the time at which the shop at the corner closed she (<font color='blue'><b>Monica</b></font>) decided to go out herself for a quarter of a pound of tea and two pounds of sugar.
<p/>A little lamp with a white china shade stood upon the table and its light fell over a photograph which was enclosed in a frame of crumpled horn.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Monica</b></font>) put the sleeping child deftly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) arms and said: <div class="bookquote">``Here. Don't waken him (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>It was Annie's photograph. Little Chandler looked at it, pausing at the thin tight lips.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) wore the pale blue summer blouse which he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) home as a present one Saturday. It had cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) ten and elevenpence; but what an agony of nervousness it had cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>)!
<p/>How he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) had suffered that day, waiting at the shop door until the shop was empty, standing at the counter and trying to appear at his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) ease while the girl piled ladies' blouses before him (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>), paying at the desk and forgetting to take up the odd penny of his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) change, being called back by the cashier, and finally, striving to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) blushes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) left the shop by examining the parcel to see if it was securely tied.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) brought the blouse home Annie kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) and said it was very pretty and stylish; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) heard the price she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) threw the blouse on the table and said it was a regular swindle to charge ten and elevenpence for it.
<p/>but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) tried it on she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) was delighted with it, especially with the make of the sleeves, and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) was very good to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>).
<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) wanted to take it back Hm!... He (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) looked coldly into the eyes of the photograph and they answered coldly.
<p/>Certainly they were pretty and the face itself was pretty. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) found something mean in it. Why was it so unconscious and ladylike?
<p/>The composure of the eyes irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>). They repelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) and defied him (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>): there was no passion in them, no rapture.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) thought of what Gallaher had said about rich Jewesses. Those dark Oriental eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) thought, how full they are of passion, of voluptuous longing!...
<p/>Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) married the eyes in the photograph? He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) caught himself up at the question and glanced nervously round the room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) found something mean in the pretty furniture which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) had bought for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) house on the hire system. Annie had chosen it herself and it reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>).
<p/>It too was prim and pretty. A dull resentment against his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) life awoke within him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>). Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) not escape from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) little house?
<p/>Was it too late for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) to try to live bravely like Gallaher? Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) go to London? There was the furniture still to be paid for.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>) could only write a book and get it published, that might open the way for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gallaher</b></font>). A volume of Byron's poems lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) on the table.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) opened it cautiously with his (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) left hand lest he (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) should waken the child and began to read the first poem in the book:
<p/>Not e`en a Zephyr wanders through the grove, Whilst I return to view my Margaret's tomb And scatter flowers on the dust I love.
<p/>Hushed are the winds and still the evening gloom, He (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) paused. He (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) felt the rhythm of the verse about him (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) in the room.
<p/>There were so many things he (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) wanted to describe: his (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) sensation of a few hours before on Grattan Bridge, for example.
<p/>How melancholy it was! Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>), too, write like that, express the melancholy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) soul in verse? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) could get back again into that mood....
<p/>The child awoke and began to cry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) turned from the page and tried to hush it: but it would not be hushed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) rocked it faster while his (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) eyes began to read the second stanza: Within this narrow cell reclines her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) clay, That clay where once...
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) began to rock it to and fro in his (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) arms but its wailing cry grew keener. It was useless. He (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) couldn't read.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) couldn't do anything. The wailing of the child pierced the drum of his (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) ear. It was useless, useless! He (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) was a prisoner for life.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) arms trembled with anger and suddenly bending to the child's face he (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) shouted: <div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The child stopped for an instant, had a spasm of fright and began to scream.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) jumped up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) chair and walked hastily up and down the room with the child in his (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) arms. It began to sob piteously, losing its breath for four or five seconds, and then bursting out anew.
<p/>The thin walls of the room echoed the sound. He (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) tried to soothe it but it sobbed more convulsively. He (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) looked at the contracted and quivering face of the child and began to be alarmed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) counted seven sobs without a break between them and caught the child to his (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) breast in fright. If it died!...
<p/>The door was burst open and a young woman ran in, panting. '' What is it? What is it? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried.
<p/>The child, hearing its mother's voice, broke out into a paroxysm of sobbing. '' It's nothing, Annie... it's nothing.... He (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>) began to cry...
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) parcels on the floor and snatched the child from him (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>). '' What have you done to him (<font color='blue'><b>Byron</b></font>)?
<p/>Little Chandler sustained for one moment the gaze of her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) eyes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) heart closed together as he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) met the hatred in them.
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) cried, glaring into his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) began to stammer: <div class="bookquote">``It's nothing.... He (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>)... he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) began to cry.... I couldn't... I didn't do anything....
<p/>Giving no heed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) began to walk up and down the room, clasping the child tightly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Annie</b></font>) arms and murmuring:
<p/>What?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My little man! My little mannie! Was `ou frightened, love?... There now, love! There now!... Lambabaun! Mamma's little lamb of the world!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) listened while the paroxysm of the child's sobbing grew less and less; and tears of remorse started to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>... There now! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Chandler/Little Chandler</b></font>)</div>Little Chandler felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) cheeks suffused with shame and he (<font color='blue'><b>Chandler</b></font>) stood back out of the lamplight. COUNTERPARTS
<p/>THE bell rang furiously and, when Miss Parker went to the tube, a furious voice called out in a piercing North of Ireland accent:
<p/>Miss Parker returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) machine, saying to a man who was writing at a desk: ``Mr. Alleyne wants you upstairs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Send Farrington here!''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>'' The man muttered <div class="bookquote">``Blast him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breath and pushed back his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair to stand up. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood up he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was tall and of great bulk.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a hanging face, dark wine-coloured, with fair eyebrows and moustache: his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes bulged forward slightly and the whites of them were dirty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went heavily upstairs until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to the second landing, where a door bore a brass plate with the inscription Mr. Alleyne.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) lifted up the counter and, passing by the clients, went out of the office with a heavy step. Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) halted, puffing with labour and vexation, and knocked.
<p/>Simultaneously Mr. Alleyne, a little man wearing gold-rimmed glasses on a cleanshaven face, shot his (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) head up over a pile of documents.
<p/>The shrill voice cried: <div class="bookquote">``Come in!''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man entered Mr. Alleyne's room. The head itself was so pink and hairless it seemed like a large egg reposing on the papers.
<p/>Mr. Alleyne did not lose a moment: <div class="bookquote">``Farrington? What is the meaning of this? Why have I always to complain of you?
<p/>May I ask you why you haven't made a copy of that contract between Bodley and Kirwan? I told you it must be ready by four o'clock.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Alleyne</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But Mr. Shelley said, sir--'' <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Shelley said, sir.... Kindly attend to what I say and not to what Mr. Shelley says, sir.
<p/>Let me tell you that if the contract is not copied before this evening I'll lay the matter before Mr. Crosbie....
<p/>You have always some excuse or another for shirking work. Do you hear me now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelley</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you hear me now?...
<p/>Understand once for all that you get a half an hour for your lunch and not an hour and a half.
<p/>Ay and another little matter! I might as well be talking to the wall as talking to you. How many courses do you want, I'd like to know....
<p/>Do you mind me now?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, sir.'' Mr. Alleyne bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) head again upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) pile of papers. The man stared fixedly at the polished skull which directed the affairs of Crosbie & Alleyne, gauging its fragility.
<p/>A spasm of rage gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) throat for a few moments and then passed, leaving after it a sharp sensation of thirst.
<p/>The middle of the month was passed and, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) could get the copy done in time, Mr. Alleyne might give him (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) an order on the cashier.
<p/>The man recognised the sensation and felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) must have a good night's drinking. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) stood still, gazing fixedly at the head upon the pile of papers.
<p/>Then, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) had been unaware of the man's presence till that moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) shot up his (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) head again, saying: <div class="bookquote">``Eh?
<p/>Suddenly Mr. Alleyne began to upset all the papers, searching for something. Are you going to stand there all day? Upon my word, Farrington, you take things easy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The man walked heavily towards the door and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went out of the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard Mr. Alleyne cry after him (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) that if the contract was not copied by evening Mr. Crosbie would hear of the matter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was waiting to see... ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very good, you needn't wait to see. Go downstairs and do your work. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Crosbie</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Crosbie</b></font>) desk in the lower office and counted the sheets which remained to be copied.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Crosbie</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Crosbie</b></font>) pen and dipped it in the ink but he (<font color='blue'><b>Crosbie</b></font>) continued to stare stupidly at the last words he (<font color='blue'><b>Crosbie</b></font>) had written: In no case shall the said Bernard Bodley be...
<p/>The evening was falling and in a few minutes they would be lighting the gas: then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bodley</b></font>) could write. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bodley</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bodley</b></font>) must slake the thirst in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bodley</b></font>) throat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bodley</b></font>) stood up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bodley</b></font>) desk and, lifting the counter as before, passed out of the office. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Bodley</b></font>) was passing out the chief clerk looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bodley</b></font>) inquiringly.
<p/>'' It's all right, Mr. Shelley,'' said the man, pointing with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger to indicate the objective of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) journey. The chief clerk glanced at the hat-rack, but, seeing the row complete, offered no remark.
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was on the landing the man pulled a shepherd's plaid cap out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket, put it on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head and ran quickly down the rickety stairs.
<p/>From the street door he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked on furtively on the inner side of the path towards the corner and all at once dived into a doorway.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was now safe in the dark snug of O'Neill's shop, and filling up the little window that looked into the bar with his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Neill</b></font>) inflamed face, the colour of dark wine or dark meat, he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Neill</b></font>) called out: <div class="bookquote">``Here, Pat, give us a g.p., like a good fellow.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The curate brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Pat</b></font>) a glass of plain porter. The man drank it at a gulp and asked for a caraway seed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) penny on the counter and, leaving the curate to grope for it in the gloom, retreated out of the snug as furtively as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had entered it.
<p/>Darkness, accompanied by a thick fog, was gaining upon the dusk of February and the lamps in Eustace Street had been lit.
<p/>The man went up by the houses until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached the door of the office, wondering whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could finish his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) copy in time.
<p/>On the stairs a moist pungent odour of perfumes saluted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose: evidently Miss Delacour had come while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was out in O'Neill's.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crammed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cap back again into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket and re-entered the office, assuming an air of absentmindedness. '' Mr. Alleyne has been calling for you,'' said the chief clerk severely.
<p/>The man glanced at the two clients who were standing at the counter as if to intimate that their presence prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from answering.
<p/>'' Where were you? '' As the clients were both male the chief clerk allowed himself a laugh. '' I know that game,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Five times in one day is a little bit... Well, you better look sharp and get a copy of our correspondence in the Delacour case for Mr. Alleyne.
<p/>This address in the presence of the public, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) run upstairs and the porter he (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) had gulped down so hastily confused the man and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat down at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desk to get what was required, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) realised how hopeless was the task of finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) copy of the contract before half past five.
<p/>The dark damp night was coming and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) longed to spend it in the bars, drinking with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends amid the glare of gas and the clatter of glasses.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got out the Delacour correspondence and passed out of the office. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hoped Mr. Alleyne would not discover that the last two letters were missing.
<p/>The moist pungent perfume lay all the way up to Mr. Alleyne's room. Miss Delacour was a middle-aged woman of Jewish appearance.
<p/>Mr. Alleyne was said to be sweet on her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) or on her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) money. She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) came to the office often and stayed a long time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) came.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) was sitting beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) desk now in an aroma of perfumes, smoothing the handle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) umbrella and nodding the great black feather in her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) hat.
<p/>The man put the correspondence on the desk and bowed respectfully but neither Mr. Alleyne nor Miss Delacour took any notice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) bow.
<p/>Mr. Alleyne had swivelled his (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) chair round to face her (<font color='blue'><b>Delacour</b></font>) and thrown his (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) right foot jauntily upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) left knee. Mr. Alleyne tapped a finger on the correspondence and then flicked it towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) as if to say:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That's all right: you can go. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The man returned to the lower office and sat down again at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desk.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stared intently at the incomplete phrase: In no case shall the said Bernard Bodley be... and thought how strange it was that the last three words began with the same letter.
<p/>The man listened to the clicking of the machine for a few minutes and then set to work to finish his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) copy.
<p/>The chief clerk began to hurry Miss Parker, saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) would never have the letters typed in time for post. But his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head was not clear and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind wandered away to the glare and rattle of the public-house.
<p/>It was a night for hot punches. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) struggled on with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) copy, but when the clock struck five he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had still fourteen pages to write.
<p/>Blast it! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't finish it in time. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) longed to execrate aloud, to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fist down on something violently.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so enraged that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote Bernard Bernard instead of Bernard Bodley and had to begin again on a clean sheet.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bodley</b></font>) felt strong enough to clear out the whole office singlehanded. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bodley</b></font>) body ached to do something, to rush out and revel in violence.
<p/>All the indignities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bodley</b></font>) life enraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Bodley</b></font>).... Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Bodley</b></font>) ask the cashier privately for an advance? No, the cashier was no good,
<p/>no damn good: he (<font color='blue'><b>Bodley</b></font>) wouldn't give an advance.... He (<font color='blue'><b>Bodley</b></font>) knew where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bodley</b></font>) would meet the boys: Leonard and O'Halloran and Nosey Flynn.
<p/>The barometer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Flynn</b></font>) emotional nature was set for a spell of riot. His (<font color='blue'><b>Flynn</b></font>) imagination had so abstracted him (<font color='blue'><b>Flynn</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Flynn</b></font>) name was called twice before he (<font color='blue'><b>Flynn</b></font>) answered.
<p/>Mr. Alleyne and Miss Delacour were standing outside the counter and all the clerks had turn round in anticipation of something.
<p/>The man got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desk. Mr. Alleyne began a tirade of abuse, saying that two letters were missing. The man answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) knew nothing about them, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) had made a faithful copy.
<p/>The tirade continued: it was so bitter and violent that the man could hardly restrain his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fist from descending upon the head of the manikin before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' I know nothing about any other two letters,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said stupidly. '' You--know--nothing. Of course you know nothing,'' said Mr. Alleyne.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) added, glancing first for approval to the lady beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>), ``do you take me for a fool? Do you think me an utter fool?
<p/>The man glanced from the lady's face to the little egg-shaped head and back again; and, almost before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was aware of it, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tongue had found a felicitous moment: <div class="bookquote">``I don't think, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that that's a fair question to put to me.
<p/>Everyone was astounded -LRB-the author of the witticism no less than his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) neighbours-RRB- and Miss Delacour, who was a stout amiable person, began to smile broadly.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' There was a pause in the very breathing of the clerks. Mr. Alleyne flushed to the hue of a wild rose and his (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) mouth twitched with a dwarf's passion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) fist in the man's face till it seemed to vibrate like the knob of some electric machine: <div class="bookquote">``You impertinent ruffian!
<p/>You impertinent ruffian! I'll make short work of you! Wait till you see! You'll apologise to me for your impertinence or you'll quit the office instanter!
<p/>You'll quit this, I'm telling you, or you'll apologise to me! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>* * * * * He (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) stood in a doorway opposite the office watching to see if the cashier would come out alone.
<p/>All the clerks passed out and finally the cashier came out with the chief clerk. It was no use trying to say a word to him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) was with the chief clerk.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) had been obliged to offer an abject apology to Mr. Alleyne for his (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) impertinence but he (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) knew what a hornet's nest the office would be for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) could remember the way in which Mr. Alleyne had hounded little Peake out of the office in order to make room for his (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) own nephew.
<p/>The man felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) position was bad enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt savage and thirsty and revengeful, annoyed with himself and with everyone else.
<p/>Mr. Alleyne would never give him (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) an hour's rest; his (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) life would be a hell to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) had made a proper fool of himself this time.
<p/>But they had never pulled together from the first, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) and Mr. Alleyne, ever since the day Mr. Alleyne had overheard him (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) mimicking his (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) North of Ireland accent to amuse Higgins and Miss Parker: that had been the beginning of it.
<p/>Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) not keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) tongue in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) cheek? He (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) might have tried Higgins for the money, but sure Higgins never had anything for himself.
<p/>A man with two establishments to keep up, of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) couldn't.... He (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) great body again aching for the comfort of the public-house.
<p/>The fog had begun to chill him (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) wondered could he (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) touch Pat in O'Neill's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) could not touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) for more than a bob--and a bob was no use.
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) must get money somewhere or other: he (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) had spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) last penny for the g.p. and soon it would be too late for getting money anywhere.
<p/>Suddenly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) was fingering his (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) watch-chain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) thought of Terry Kelly's pawn-office in Fleet Street. That was the dart! Why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) think of it sooner?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) went through the narrow alley of Temple Bar quickly, muttering to himself that they could all go to hell because he (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) was going to have a good night of it.
<p/>The clerk in Terry Kelly's said A crown! but the consignor held out for six shillings; and in the end the six shillings was allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>) literally.
<p/>In Westmoreland Street the footpaths were crowded with young men and women returning from business and ragged urchins ran here and there yelling out the names of the evening editions.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>) came out of the pawn-office joyfully, making a little cylinder, of the coins between his (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>) thumb and fingers. The man passed through the crowd, looking on the spectacle generally with proud satisfaction and staring masterfully at the office-girls.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>) head was full of the noises of tram-gongs and swishing trolleys and his (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>) nose already sniffed the curling fumes of punch.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>) walked on he (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>) preconsidered the terms in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>) would narrate the incident to the boys: <div class="bookquote">``So, I just looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>)--coolly, you know, and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kelly</b></font>).
<p/>I don't think that that's a fair question to put to me,' says I.''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>Nosey Flynn was sitting up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Flynn</b></font>) usual corner of Davy Byrne's and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Flynn</b></font>) heard the story, he (<font color='blue'><b>Flynn</b></font>) stood Farrington a half-one, saying it was as smart a thing as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Flynn</b></font>) heard.
<p/>Then I looked back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Flynn</b></font>) again--taking my time, you know. ' Farrington stood a drink in his (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) turn. After a while O'Halloran and Paddy Leonard came in and the story was repeated to them.
<p/>O'Halloran stood tailors of malt, hot, all round and told the story of the retort he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Halloran</b></font>) had made to the chief clerk when he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Halloran</b></font>) was in Callan's of Fownes's Street; but, as the retort was after the manner of the liberal shepherds in the eclogues, he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Halloran</b></font>) had to admit that it was not as clever as Farrington's retort.
<p/>At this Farrington told the boys to polish off that and have another. Just as they were naming their poisons who should come in but Higgins!
<p/>The men asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) version of it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) did so with great vivacity for the sight of five small hot whiskies was very exhilarating.
<p/>Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) had to join in with the others. Everyone roared laughing when he (<font color='blue'><b>Higgins</b></font>) showed the way in which Mr. Alleyne shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) fist in Farrington's face.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Alleyne</b></font>) imitated Farrington, saying, <div class="bookquote">``And here was my nabs, as cool as you please,''  (<font color='red'><b>Farrington</b></font>)</div>while Farrington looked at the company out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) heavy dirty eyes, smiling and at times drawing forth stray drops of liquor from his (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) moustache with the aid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) lower lip.
<p/>O'Halloran had money but neither of the other two seemed to have any; so the whole party left the shop somewhat regretfully.
<p/>At the corner of Duke Street Higgins and Nosey Flynn bevelled off to the left while the other three turned back towards the city.
<p/>When that round was over there was a pause. Rain was drizzling down on the cold streets and, when they reached the Ballast Office, Farrington suggested the Scotch House.
<p/>The three men pushed past the whining match-sellers at the door and formed a little party at the corner of the counter.
<p/>Leonard introduced them to a young fellow named Weathers who was performing at the Tivoli as an acrobat and knockabout artiste.
<p/>The bar was full of men and loud with the noise of tongues and glasses. They began to exchange stories. Farrington stood a drink all round.
<p/>Farrington, who had definite notions of what was what, asked the boys would they have an Apollinaris too; but the boys told Tim to make theirs hot.
<p/>Weathers said he (<font color='blue'><b>Weathers</b></font>) would take a small Irish and Apollinaris. The talk became theatrical. O'Halloran stood a round and then Farrington stood another round, Weathers protesting that the hospitality was too Irish.
<p/>O'Halloran said that he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Halloran</b></font>) and Leonard would go, but that Farrington wouldn't go because he (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) was a married man; and Farrington's heavy dirty eyes leered at the company in token that he (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) understood he (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) was being chaffed.
<p/>Weathers made them all have just one little tincture at his (<font color='blue'><b>Weathers</b></font>) expense and promised to meet them later on at Mulligan's in Poolbeg Street.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mulligan</b></font>) promised to get them in behind the scenes and introduce them to some nice girls. When the Scotch House closed they went round to Mulligan's.
<p/>They went into the parlour at the back and O'Halloran ordered small hot specials all round. They were all beginning to feel mellow.
<p/>Farrington was just standing another round when Weathers came back. Much to Farrington's relief he (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) drank a glass of bitter this time.
<p/>Presently two young women with big hats and a young man in a check suit came in and sat at a table close by.
<p/>Funds were getting low but they had enough to keep them going. Weathers saluted them and told the company that they were out of the Tivoli.
<p/>Farrington's eyes wandered at every moment in the direction of one of the young women. There was something striking in her (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) appearance.
<p/>An immense scarf of peacock-blue muslin was wound round her (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) hat and knotted in a great bow under her (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) chin; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) wore bright yellow gloves, reaching to the elbow.
<p/>Farrington gazed admiringly at the plump arm which she (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) moved very often and with much grace; and when, after a little time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) gaze he (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) admired still more her (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) large dark brown eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) once or twice and, when the party was leaving the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) brushed against his (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) chair and said <div class="bookquote">``O, pardon!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in a London accent.
<p/>The oblique staring expression in them fascinated him (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) leave the room in the hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) would look back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) was disappointed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) cursed his (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) want of money and cursed all the rounds he (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) had stood, particularly all the whiskies and Apolinaris which he (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) had stood to Weathers.
<p/>If there was one thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weathers</b></font>) hated it was a sponge. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weathers</b></font>) was so angry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weathers</b></font>) lost count of the conversation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weathers</b></font>) friends.
<p/>Weathers was showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Weathers</b></font>) biceps muscle to the company and boasting so much that the other two had called on Farrington to uphold the national honour.
<p/>When Paddy Leonard called him (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Leonard</b></font>) found that they were talking about feats of strength. Farrington pulled up his (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) sleeve accordingly and showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) biceps muscle to the company.
<p/>The two arms were examined and compared and finally it was agreed to have a trial of strength. The table was cleared and the two men rested their elbows on it, clasping hands.
<p/>When Paddy Leonard said <div class="bookquote">``Go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Leonard/Paddy Leonard</b></font>)</div>each was to try to bring down the other's hand on to the table. Farrington looked very serious and determined.
<p/>The trial began. After about thirty seconds Weathers brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Weathers</b></font>) opponent's hand slowly down on to the table. Farrington's dark wine-coloured face flushed darker still with anger and humiliation at having been defeated by such a stripling.
<p/>'' You're not to put the weight of your body behind it. Play fair,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Farrington</b></font>) said. '' Who's not playing fair?'' said the other.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on again. The two best out of three. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The trial began again. The veins stood out on Farrington's forehead, and the pallor of Weathers' complexion changed to peony.
<p/>Their hands and arms trembled under the stress. After a long struggle Weathers again brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Weathers</b></font>) opponent's hand slowly on to the table.
<p/>There was a murmur of applause from the spectators. The curate, who was standing beside the table, nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Weathers</b></font>) red head towards the victor and said with stupid familiarity:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! that's the knack!''  (<font color='red'><b>the victor</b></font>)</div>'' What the hell do you know about it?'' said Farrington fiercely, turning on the man. ''
<p/>What do you put in your gab for?'' '' Sh, sh! '' said O'Halloran, observing the violent expression of Farrington's face.
<p/>A very sullen-faced man stood at the corner of O'Connell Bridge waiting for the little Sandymount tram to take him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) home.
<p/>'' Pony up, boys. We'll have just one little smahan more and then we'll be off. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) was full of smouldering anger and revengefulness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) felt humiliated and discontented; he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) did not even feel drunk; and he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) had only twopence in his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) pocket. He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) cursed everything.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) had done for himself in the office, pawned his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) watch, spent all his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) money; and he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) had not even got drunk.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) began to feel thirsty again and he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) longed to be back again in the hot reeking public-house. He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) reputation as a strong man, having been defeated twice by a mere boy.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) heart swelled with fury and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) thought of the woman in the big hat who had brushed against him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) and said Pardon!
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) tram let him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) down at Shelbourne Road and he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) steered his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) great body along in the shadow of the wall of the barracks.
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) fury nearly choked him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) loathed returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) home. When he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) went in by the side-door he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) found the kitchen empty and the kitchen fire nearly out.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) wife was a little sharp-faced woman who bullied her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband when he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) was sober and was bullied by him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) was drunk.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connell</b></font>) bawled upstairs: <div class="bookquote">``Ada! Ada! ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>They had five children. A little boy came running down the stairs. '' Who is that?'' said the man, peering through the darkness.
<p/>'' Me, pa. '' '' Who are you? Charlie? '' '' No, pa. Tom. '' '' Where's your mother?'' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s out at the chapel.
<p/>'' '' That's right.... Did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) think of leaving any dinner for me?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, pa. I--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Light the lamp. What do you mean by having the place in darkness?
<p/>Are the other children in bed? ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man sat down heavily on one of the chairs while the little boy lit the lamp.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) began to mimic his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) son's flat accent, saying half to himself: <div class="bookquote">``At the chapel. At the chapel, if you please!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>When the lamp was lit he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) banged his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fist on the table and shouted: <div class="bookquote">``What's for my dinner?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' I'm going... to cook it, pa,'' said the little boy.
<p/>The man jumped up furiously and pointed to the fire. '' On that fire! You let the fire out! By God, I'll teach you to do that again!''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) took a step to the door and seized the walking-stick which was standing behind it. '' I'll teach you to let the fire out!
<p/>The little boy cried <div class="bookquote">``O, pa!''  (<font color='red'><b>The boy</b></font>)</div>and ran whimpering round the table, but the man followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and caught him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the coat.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, rolling up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleeve in order to give his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm free play. The little boy looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wildly but, seeing no way of escape, fell upon his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knees.
<p/>'' Now, you'll let the fire out the next time!'' said the man striking at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vigorously with the stick. ''
<p/>Take that, you little whelp!'' The boy uttered a squeal of pain as the stick cut his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thigh. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands together in the air and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) voice shook with fright.
<p/>'' O, pa! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cried. '' Don't beat me, pa! And I'll... I'll say a Hail Mary for you.... I'll say a Hail Mary for you, pa, if you don't beat me....
<p/>THE matron had given her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) leave to go out as soon as the women's tea was over and Maria looked forward to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) evening out.
<p/>I'll say a Hail Mary... '' CLAY The kitchen was spick and span: the cook said you could see yourself in the big copper boilers.
<p/>These barmbracks seemed uncut; but if you went closer you would see that they had been cut into long thick even slices and were ready to be handed round at tea.
<p/>The fire was nice and bright and on one of the side-tables were four very big barmbracks. Maria had cut them herself.
<p/>Maria was a very, very small person indeed but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had a very long nose and a very long chin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) talked a little through her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) nose, always soothingly:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``No, my dear. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was always sent for when the women quarrelled over their tubs and always succeeded in making peace.
<p/>One day the matron had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Maria, you are a veritable peace-maker!''  (<font color='red'><b>the matron</b></font>)</div>And the sub-matron and two of the Board ladies had heard the compliment.
<p/>And Ginger Mooney was always saying what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) wouldn't do to the dummy who had charge of the irons if it wasn't for Maria.
<p/>Everyone was so fond of Maria. The women would have their tea at six o'clock and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) would be able to get away before seven.
<p/>From Ballsbridge to the Pillar, twenty minutes; from the Pillar to Drumcondra, twenty minutes; and twenty minutes to buy the things.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) would be there before eight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) took out her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) purse with the silver clasps and read again the words A Present from Belfast.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was very fond of that purse because Joe had brought it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) five years before when he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) and Alphy had gone to Belfast on a Whit-Monday trip.
<p/>In the purse were two half-crowns and some coppers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) would have five shillings clear after paying tram fare. What a nice evening they would have, all the children singing!
<p/>Often he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) to go and live with them; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) would have felt herself in the way -LRB-though Joe's wife was ever so nice with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)-RRB- and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had become accustomed to the life of the laundry.
<p/>Only she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hoped that Joe wouldn't come in drunk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was so different when he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) took any drink. Joe was a good fellow.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had nursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) and Alphy too; and Joe used often say: <div class="bookquote">``Mamma is mamma but Maria is my proper mother.
<p/>After the break-up at home the boys had got her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) that position in the Dublin by Lamplight laundry, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) liked it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) used to have such a bad opinion of Protestants but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) thought they were very nice people, a little quiet and serious, but still very nice people to live with.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had lovely ferns and wax-plants and, whenever anyone came to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) always gave the visitor one or two slips from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) conservatory.
<p/>There was one thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) didn't like and that was the tracts on the walks; but the matron was such a nice person to deal with, so genteel.
<p/>When the cook told her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) everything was ready she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) went into the women's room and began to pull the big bell.
<p/>In a few minutes the women began to come in by twos and threes, wiping their steaming hands in their petticoats and pulling down the sleeves of their blouses over their red steaming arms.
<p/>They settled down before their huge mugs which the cook and the dummy filled up with hot tea, already mixed with milk and sugar in huge tin cans.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Joe/Joe Dillon</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) plants in the conservatory and she (<font color='blue'><b>matron</b></font>) liked looking after them. Maria superintended the distribution of the barmbrack and saw that every woman got her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) four slices.
<p/>Lizzie Fleming said Maria was sure to get the ring and, though Fleming had said that for so many Hallow Eves, Maria had to laugh and say she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) didn't want any ring or man either; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) laughed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) grey-green eyes sparkled with disappointed shyness and the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) nose nearly met the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) chin.
<p/>Then Ginger Mooney lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) mug of tea and proposed Maria's health while all the other women clattered with their mugs on the table, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) hadn't a sup of porter to drink it in.
<p/>There was a great deal of laughing and joking during the meal. And Maria laughed again till the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) nose nearly met the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) chin and till
<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) minute body nearly shook itself asunder because she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) knew that Mooney meant well though, of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mooney</b></font>) had the notions of a common woman.
<p/>But wasn't Maria glad when the women had finished their tea and the cook and the dummy had begun to clear away the tea-things!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) went into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) little bedroom and, remembering that the next morning was a mass morning, changed the hand of the alarm from seven to six.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) working skirt and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) house-boots and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) best skirt out on the bed and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) tiny dress-boots beside the foot of the bed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) blouse too and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) stood before the mirror, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) thought of how she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) used to dress for mass on Sunday morning when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was a young girl; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) looked with quaint affection at the diminutive body which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had so often adorned.
<p/>In spite of its years she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) found it a nice tidy little body. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) got outside the streets were shining with rain and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was glad of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) old brown waterproof.
<p/>The tram was full and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had to sit on the little stool at the end of the car, facing all the people, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) toes barely touching the floor.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) arranged in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) mind all she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was going to do and thought how much better it was to be independent and to have your own money in your pocket.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) hoped they would have a nice evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was sure they would but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could not help thinking what a pity it was Alphy and Joe were not speaking.
<p/>They were always falling out now but when they were boys together they used to be the best of friends: but such was life.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) went into Downes's cake-shop but the shop was so full of people that it was a long time before she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could get herself attended to.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) bought a dozen of mixed penny cakes, and at last came out of the shop laden with a big bag.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) got out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) tram at the Pillar and ferreted her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) way quickly among the crowds. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) thought what else would she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) buy: she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) wanted to buy something really nice.
<p/>They would be sure to have plenty of apples and nuts. It was hard to know what to buy and all she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could think of was cake.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) decided to buy some plumcake but Downes's plumcake had not enough almond icing on top of it so she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) went over to a shop in Henry Street.
<p/>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was a long time in suiting herself and the stylish young lady behind the counter, who was evidently a little annoyed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was it wedding-cake she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) wanted to buy.
<p/>That made Maria blush and smile at the young lady; but the young lady took it all very seriously and finally cut a thick slice of plumcake, parcelled it up and said: <div class="bookquote">``Two-and-four, please.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have to stand in the Drumcondra tram because none of the young men seemed to notice her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) but an elderly gentleman made room for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a stout gentleman and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wore a brown hard hat; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had a square red face and a greyish moustache.
<p/>Maria thought he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a colonel-looking gentleman and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) reflected how much more polite he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was than the young men who simply stared straight before them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) supposed the bag was full of good things for the little ones and said it was only right that the youngsters should enjoy themselves while they were young.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>The gentleman began to chat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) about Hallow Eve and the rainy weather. Maria agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) and favoured him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with demure nods and hems.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was very nice with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was getting out at the Canal Bridge she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) and bowed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bowed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) and raised his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hat and smiled agreeably, and
<p/>while she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was going up along the terrace, bending her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) tiny head under the rain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) thought how easy it was to know a gentleman even when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has a drop taken.
<p/>Everybody said: <div class="bookquote">``O, here's Maria!''  (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div>when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) came to Joe's house. Joe was there, having come home from business, and all the children had their Sunday dresses on.
<p/>There were two big girls in from next door and games were going on. Maria gave the bag of cakes to the eldest boy, Alphy, to divide and
<p/>Mrs. Donnelly said it was too good of her (<font color='blue'><b>Donnelly</b></font>) to bring such a big bag of cakes and made all the children say:
<p/>But Maria said she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had brought something special for papa and mamma, something they would be sure to like, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) began to look for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) plumcake.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thanks, Maria. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) tried in Downes's bag and then in the pockets of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) waterproof and then on the hallstand
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) asked all the children had any of them eaten it--by mistake, of course--but the children all said no and looked as if they did not like to eat cakes if they were to be accused of stealing.
<p/>Everybody had a solution for the mystery and Mrs. Donnelly said it was plain that Maria had left it behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) in the tram.
<p/>but nowhere could she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) find it. Maria, remembering how confused the gentleman with the greyish moustache had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), coloured with shame and vexation and disappointment.
<p/>At the thought of the failure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) little surprise and of the two and fourpence she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had thrown away for nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) nearly cried outright.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) all that went on in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) office, repeating for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) a smart answer which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had made to the manager.
<p/>But Joe said it didn't matter and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sit down by the fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was very nice with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). Maria did not understand why Joe laughed so much over the answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had made
<p/>Joe said he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wasn't so bad when you knew how to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was a decent sort so long as you didn't rub him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) the wrong way.
<p/>but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) said that the manager must have been a very overbearing person to deal with. Mrs. Donnelly played the piano for the children and they danced and sang.
<p/>Nobody could find the nutcrackers and Joe was nearly getting cross over it and asked how did they expect Maria to crack nuts without a nutcracker.
<p/>Then the two next-door girls handed round the nuts. But Maria said she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) didn't like nuts and that they weren't to bother about her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>).
<p/>Then Joe asked would she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) take a bottle of stout and Mrs. Donnelly said there was port wine too in the house if she (<font color='blue'><b>Donnelly</b></font>) would prefer that.
<p/>So Maria let him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) have his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) way and they sat by the fire talking over old times and Maria thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) would put in a good word for Alphy.
<p/>But Joe cried that God might strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) stone dead if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) spoke a word to his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) brother again and Maria said she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had mentioned the matter.
<p/>Mrs. Donnelly told her (<font color='blue'><b>Donnelly</b></font>) husband it was a great shame for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to speak that way of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own flesh and blood
<p/>but Joe said that Alphy was no brother of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) and there was nearly being a row on the head of it.
<p/>But Joe said he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) would not lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) temper on account of the night it was and asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wife to open some more stout.
<p/>Maria said she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) would rather they didn't ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) to take anything: but Joe insisted. The two next-door girls had arranged some Hallow Eve games and soon everything was merry again.
<p/>Maria was delighted to see the children so merry and Joe and his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wife in such good spirits. The next-door girls put some saucers on the table and then led the children up to the table, blindfold.
<p/>One got the prayer-book and the other three got the water; and when one of the next-door girls got the ring Mrs. Donnelly shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Donnelly</b></font>) finger at the blushing girl as much as to say: O, I know all about it!
<p/>They insisted then on blindfolding Maria and leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) up to the table to see what she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) would get; and, while they were putting on the bandage, Maria laughed and laughed again till the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) nose nearly met the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) chin.
<p/>They led her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) up to the table amid laughing and joking and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) hand out in the air as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was told to do.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) hand about here and there in the air and descended on one of the saucers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) felt a soft wet substance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) fingers and was surprised that nobody spoke or took off her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) bandage.
<p/>Somebody said something about the garden, and at last Mrs. Donnelly said something very cross to one of the next-door girls and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Donnelly</b></font>) to throw it out at once: that was no play.
<p/>There was a pause for a few seconds; and then a great deal of scuffling and whispering. Maria understood that it was wrong that time
<p/>and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had to do it over again: and this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) got the prayer-book. After that Mrs. Donnelly played Miss McCloud's Reel for the children and Joe made Maria take a glass of wine.
<p/>Soon they were all quite merry again and Mrs. Donnelly said Maria would enter a convent before the year was out because she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had got the prayer-book.
<p/>Maria had never seen Joe so nice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was that night, so full of pleasant talk and reminiscences.
<p/>At last the children grew tired and sleepy and Joe asked Maria would she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) not sing some little song before she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) went, one of the old songs.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) said they were all very good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). Mrs. Donnelly said <div class="bookquote">``Do, please, Maria!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Donnelly</b></font>)</div>and so Maria had to get up and stand beside the piano.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) played the prelude and said <div class="bookquote">``Now, Maria!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and Maria, blushing very much began to sing in a tiny quavering voice.
<p/>Mrs. Donnelly bade the children be quiet and listen to Maria's song. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sang I Dreamt that I Dwelt, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) came to the second verse she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sang again:
<p/>I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls With vassals and serfs at my side, And of all who assembled within those walls That I was the hope and the pride.
<p/>I had riches too great to count; could boast Of a high ancestral name, But I also dreamt, which pleased me most, That you loved me still the same.
<p/>But no one tried to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) mistake; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had ended her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) song Joe was very much moved.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) said that there was no time like the long ago and no music for him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) like poor old Balfe, whatever other people might say; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) eyes filled up so much with tears that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) could not find what he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was looking for and in the end he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wife to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) where the corkscrew was.
<p/>JAMES DUFFY lived in Chapelizod because he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) wished to live as far as possible from the city of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) was a citizen and because he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) found all the other suburbs of Dublin mean, modern and pretentious.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) lived in an old sombre house and from his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) windows he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) could look into the disused distillery or upwards along the shallow river on which Dublin is built.
<p/>A PAINFUL CASE MR. The lofty walls of his (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) uncarpeted room were free from pictures. He (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) had himself bought every article of furniture in the room:
<p/>a black iron bedstead, an iron washstand, four cane chairs, a clothes-rack, a coal-scuttle, a fender and irons and a square table on which lay a double desk.
<p/>A bookcase had been made in an alcove by means of shelves of white wood. The bed was clothed with white bedclothes and a black and scarlet rug covered the foot.
<p/>A little hand-mirror hung above the washstand and during the day a white-shaded lamp stood as the sole ornament of the mantelpiece.
<p/>The books on the white wooden shelves were arranged from below upwards according to bulk. A complete Wordsworth stood at one end of the lowest shelf and a copy of the Maynooth the top shelf.
<p/>In the desk lay a manuscript translation of Hauptmann's Michael Kramer, the stage directions of which were written in purple ink, and a little sheaf of papers held together by a brass pin.
<p/>In these sheets a sentence was inscribed from time to time and, in an ironical moment, the headline of an advertisement for Bile Beans had been pasted on to the first sheet.
<p/>On lifting the lid of the desk a faint fragrance escaped--the fragrance of new cedarwood pencils or of a bottle of gum or of an overripe apple which might have been left there and forgotten.
<p/>Writing materials were always on the desk. Mr. Duffy abhorred anything which betokened physical or mental disorder. A mediaeval doctor would have called him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) saturnine.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) long and rather large head grew dry black hair and a tawny moustache did not quite cover an unamiable mouth.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cheekbones also gave his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) face a harsh character; but there was no harshness in the eyes which, looking at the world from under their tawny eyebrows, gave the impression of a man ever alert to greet a redeeming instinct in others but often disappointed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, which carried the entire tale of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) years, was of the brown tint of Dublin streets. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lived at a little distance from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body, regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own acts with doubtful side-glances.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had an odd autobiographical habit which led him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to compose in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind from time to time a short sentence about himself containing a subject in the third person and a predicate in the past tense.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never gave alms to beggars and walked firmly, carrying a stout hazel. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been for many years cashier of a private bank in Baggot Street.
<p/>At midday he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to Dan Burke's and took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lunch--a bottle of lager beer and a small trayful of arrowroot biscuits.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dined in an eating-house in George's Street where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt himself safe from the society of Dublin's gilded youth and where there was a certain plain honesty in the bill of fare.
<p/>Every morning he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came in from Chapelizod by tram. At four o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was set free. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) evenings were spent either before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) landlady's piano or roaming about the outskirts of the city.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liking for Mozart's music brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sometimes to an opera or a concert: these were the only dissipations of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lived his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spiritual life without any communion with others, visiting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) relatives at Christmas and escorting them to the cemetery when they died.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) performed these two social duties for old dignity's sake but conceded nothing further to the conventions which regulate the civic life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) allowed himself to think that in certain circumstances he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would rob his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hank but, as these circumstances never arose, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life rolled out evenly--an adventureless tale.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had neither companions nor friends, church nor creed. One evening he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found himself sitting beside two ladies in the Rotunda.
<p/>The lady who sat next him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked round at the deserted house once or twice and then said: <div class="bookquote">``What a pity there is such a poor house tonight!
<p/>The house, thinly peopled and silent, gave distressing prophecy of failure. It's so hard on people to have to sing to empty benches.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took the remark as an invitation to talk. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was surprised that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seemed so little awkward. While they talked he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried to fix her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) permanently in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) memory.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) learned that the young girl beside her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) daughter he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) judged her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to be a year or so younger than himself.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face, which must have been handsome, had remained intelligent. It was an oval face with strongly marked features. The eyes were very dark blue and steady.
<p/>Their gaze began with a defiant note but was confused by what seemed a deliberate swoon of the pupil into the iris, revealing for an instant a temperament of great sensibility.
<p/>The pupil reasserted itself quickly, this half-disclosed nature fell again under the reign of prudence, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) astrakhan jacket, moulding a bosom of a certain fullness, struck the note of defiance more definitely.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) again a few weeks afterwards at a concert in Earlsfort Terrace and seized the moments when her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) daughter's attention was diverted to become intimate.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) alluded once or twice to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband but her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tone was not such as to make the allusion a warning.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) name was Mrs. Sinico. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband's great-great-grandfather had come from Leghorn. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband was captain of a mercantile boat plying between Dublin and Holland; and they had one child.
<p/>This was the first of many meetings; they met always in the evening and chose the most quiet quarters for their walks together.
<p/>Mr. Duffy, however, had a distaste for underhand ways and, finding that they were compelled to meet stealthily, he (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) forced her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) house.
<p/>Meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a third time by accident he (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) found courage to make an appointment. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came. Captain Sinico encouraged his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) visits, thinking that his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) daughter's hand was in question.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had dismissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) wife so sincerely from his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) gallery of pleasures that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) did not suspect that anyone else would take an interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>As the husband was often away and the daughter out giving music lessons Mr. Duffy had many opportunities of enjoying the lady's society.
<p/>Neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) nor she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had had any such adventure before and neither was conscious of any incongruity. Little by little he (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) entangled his (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) thoughts with hers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) lent her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) books, provided her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with ideas, shared his (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) intellectual life with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) listened to all. Sometimes in return for his (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) theories she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) gave out some fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) that for some time he (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) had assisted at the meetings of an Irish Socialist Party where he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) had felt himself a unique figure amidst a score of sober workmen in a garret lit by an inefficient oil-lamp.
<p/>When the party had divided into three sections, each under its own leader and in its own garret, he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) had discontinued his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) attendances.
<p/>With almost maternal solicitude she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) urged him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) to let his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) nature open to the full: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) became his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) confessor. The workmen's discussions, he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) said, were too timorous; the interest they took in the question of wages was inordinate.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) felt that they were hard-featured realists and that they resented an exactitude which was the produce of a leisure not within their reach.
<p/>No social revolution, he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), would be likely to strike Dublin for some centuries. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) why did he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) not write out his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) thoughts.
<p/>To submit himself to the criticisms of an obtuse middle class which entrusted its morality to policemen and its fine arts to impresarios?
<p/>For what, he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), with careful scorn. To compete with phrasemongers, incapable of thinking consecutively for sixty seconds? He (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) went often to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) little cottage outside Dublin; often they spent their evenings alone.
<p/>Little by little, as their thoughts entangled, they spoke of subjects less remote. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) companionship was like a warm soil about an exotic.
<p/>Many times she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) allowed the dark to fall upon them, refraining from lighting the lamp. The dark discreet room, their isolation, the music that still vibrated in their ears united them.
<p/>This union exalted him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>), wore away the rough edges of his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) character, emotionalised his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) mental life. Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) caught himself listening to the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) own voice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) thought that in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) would ascend to an angelical stature; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) attached the fervent nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) companion more and more closely to him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) heard the strange impersonal voice which he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) recognised as his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) own, insisting on the soul's incurable loneliness.
<p/>The end of these discourses was that one night during which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had shown every sign of unusual excitement, Mrs. Sinico caught up his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) hand passionately and pressed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>) cheek.
<p/>We cannot give ourselves, it said: we are our own. Mr. Duffy was very much surprised. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>) interpretation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) words disillusioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>).
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) did not wish their last interview to be troubled by the influence of their ruined confessional they met in a little cakeshop near the Parkgate.
<p/>It was cold autumn weather but in spite of the cold they wandered up and down the roads of the Park for nearly three hours.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) did not visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>) for a week, then he (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>) asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>) to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>). They agreed to break off their intercourse: every bond, he (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) said, is a bond to sorrow.
<p/>When they came out of the Park they walked in silence towards the tram; but here she (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>) began to tremble so violently that, fearing another collapse on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>) part, he (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>)
<p/>good-bye quickly and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>). A few days later he (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) received a parcel containing his (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) books and music. Four years passed.
<p/>Some new pieces of music encumbered the music-stand in the lower room and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) shelves stood two volumes by Nietzsche:
<p/>Mr. Duffy returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) even way of life. His (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) room still bore witness of the orderliness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) mind. Thus Spake Zarathustra and The Gay Science.
<p/>One of his (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) sentences, written two months after his (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) last interview with Mrs. Sinico, read: Love between man and man is impossible because there must not be sexual intercourse and friendship between man and woman
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote seldom in the sheaf of papers which lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desk. is impossible because there must be sexual intercourse.
<p/>And still every morning he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went into the city by tram and every evening walked home from the city after having dined moderately in George's Street and read the evening paper for dessert.
<p/>One evening as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was about to put a morsel of corned beef and cabbage into his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mouth his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand stopped.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) kept away from concerts lest he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) should meet her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father died; the junior partner of the bank retired. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyes fixed themselves on a paragraph in the evening paper which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had propped against the water-carafe.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) drank a glass of water, pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) plate to one side, doubled the paper down before him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) between his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) elbows and read the paragraph over and over again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) replaced the morsel of food on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) plate and read the paragraph attentively. The cabbage began to deposit a cold white grease on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) plate.
<p/>The girl came over to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to ask was his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dinner not properly cooked. He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said it was very good and ate a few mouthfuls of it with difficulty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) walked along quickly through the November twilight, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) stout hazel stick striking the ground regularly, the fringe of the buff Mail peeping out of a side-pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) tight reefer overcoat.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) paid his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) bill and went out. On the lonely road which leads from the Parkgate to Chapelizod he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) slackened his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pace.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) stick struck the ground less emphatically and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) breath, issuing irregularly, almost with a sighing sound, condensed in the wintry air.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) reached his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) house he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) went up at once to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) bedroom and, taking the paper from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pocket, read the paragraph again by the failing light of the window.
<p/>This was the paragraph: DEATH OF A LADY AT SYDNEY PARADE A PAINFUL CASE Today at the City of Dublin Hospital
<p/>the Deputy Coroner -LRB-in the absence of Mr. Leverett-RRB- held an inquest on the body of Mrs. Emily Sinico, aged forty-three years, who was killed at Sydney Parade Station yesterday evening.
<p/>The evidence showed that the deceased lady, while attempting to cross the line, was knocked down by the engine of the ten o'clock slow train from Kingstown, thereby sustaining injuries of the head and right side which led to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) death.
<p/>James Lennon, driver of the engine, stated that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lennon</b></font>) had been in the employment of the railway company for fifteen years.
<p/>On hearing the guard's whistle he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) set the train in motion and a second or two afterwards brought it to rest in response to loud cries.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) read it not aloud, but moving his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) lips as a priest does when he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) reads the prayers Secreto. The train was going slowly.
<p/>P. Dunne, railway porter, stated that as the train was about to start he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunne</b></font>) observed a woman attempting to cross the lines.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dunne</b></font>) ran towards her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and shouted, but, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Dunne</b></font>) could reach her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was caught by the buffer of the engine and fell to the ground.
<p/>A juror. '' You saw the lady fall? '' Witness. '' Yes. '' Police Sergeant Croly deposed that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) arrived he (<font color='blue'><b>Sergeant</b></font>) found the deceased lying on the platform apparently dead.
<p/>Dr. Halpin, assistant house surgeon of the City of Dublin Hospital, stated that the deceased had two lower ribs fractured and had sustained severe contusions of the right shoulder.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) had the body taken to the waiting-room pending the arrival of the ambulance. Constable 57E corroborated. The right side of the head had been injured in the fall.
<p/>The injuries were not sufficient to have caused death in a normal person. Death, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Constable</b></font>) opinion, had been probably due to shock and sudden failure of the heart's action.
<p/>The company had always taken every precaution to prevent people crossing the lines except by the bridges, both by placing notices in every station and by the use of patent spring gates at level crossings.
<p/>The deceased had been in the habit of crossing the lines late at night from platform to platform and, in view of certain other circumstances of the case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Constable</b></font>) did not think the railway officials were to blame.
<p/>Mr. H. B. Patterson Finlay, on behalf of the railway company, expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Finlay</b></font>) deep regret at the accident. Captain Sinico, of Leoville, Sydney Parade, husband of the deceased, also gave evidence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stated that the deceased was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was not in Dublin at the time of the accident as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had arrived only that morning from Rotterdam.
<p/>They had been married for twenty-two years and had lived happily until about two years ago when his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife began to be rather intemperate in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) habits.
<p/>Miss Mary Sinico said that of late her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother had been in the habit of going out at night to buy spirits.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), witness, had often tried to reason with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother and had induced her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to join a league. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was not at home until an hour after the accident.
<p/>The jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence and exonerated Lennon from all blame. The Deputy Coroner said it was a most painful case, and expressed great sympathy with Captain Sinico and his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) daughter.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) urged on the railway company to take strong measures to prevent the possibility of similar accidents in the future. No blame attached to anyone.
<p/>The river lay quiet beside the empty distillery and from time to time a light appeared in some house on the Lucan road.
<p/>Mr. Duffy raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) eyes from the paper and gazed out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) window on the cheerless evening landscape. What an end!
<p/>The whole narrative of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>) death revolted him (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) and it revolted him (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) had ever spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>) of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) held sacred.
<p/>The threadbare phrases, the inane expressions of sympathy, the cautious words of a reporter won over to conceal the details of a commonplace vulgar death attacked his (<font color='blue'><b>reporter</b></font>) stomach.
<p/>Not merely had she (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>) degraded herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>) had degraded him (<font color='blue'><b>reporter</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>reporter</b></font>) saw the squalid tract of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>) vice, miserable and malodorous.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>reporter</b></font>) soul's companion! He (<font color='blue'><b>reporter</b></font>) thought of the hobbling wretches whom he (<font color='blue'><b>reporter</b></font>) had seen carrying cans and bottles to be filled by the barman.
<p/>Evidently she (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>) had been unfit to live, without any strength of purpose, an easy prey to habits, one of the wrecks on which civilisation has been reared.
<p/>Just God, what an end! But that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>) could have sunk so low! Was it possible he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had deceived himself so utterly about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>)?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>) outburst of that night and interpreted it in a harsher sense than he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had ever done. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had no difficulty now in approving of the course he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had taken.
<p/>As the light failed and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) memory began to wander he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Sinico</b></font>) hand touched his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). The shock which had first attacked his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stomach was now attacking his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) nerves.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) overcoat and hat quickly and went out. The cold air met him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) on the threshold; it crept into the sleeves of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) coat.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) came to the public-house at Chapelizod Bridge he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went in and ordered a hot punch. The proprietor served him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) obsequiously but did not venture to talk.
<p/>They drank at intervals from their huge pint tumblers and smoked, spitting often on the floor and sometimes dragging the sawdust over their spits with their heavy boots.
<p/>There were five or six workingmen in the shop discussing the value of a gentleman's estate in County Kildare Mr. Duffy sat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) stool and gazed at them, without seeing or hearing them.
<p/>After a while they went out and he (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) called for another punch. He (<font color='blue'><b>Duffy</b></font>) sat a long time over it. The shop was very quiet.
<p/>The proprietor sprawled on the counter reading the Herald and yawning. Now and again a tram was heard swishing along the lonely road outside.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) sat there, living over his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) life with her (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) and evoking alternately the two images in which he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) now conceived her (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) realised that she (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) was dead, that she (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) had ceased to exist, that she (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) had become a memory.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) began to feel ill at ease. He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) asked himself what else could he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) have done. He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) could not have carried on a comedy of deception with her (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) could not have lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) openly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) had done what seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) best. How was he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) to blame? Now that she (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) was gone he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) understood how lonely her (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) life must have been, sitting night after night alone in that room.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) life would be lonely too until he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>), too, died, ceased to exist, became a memory--if anyone remembered him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>). It was after nine o'clock when he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) left the shop.
<p/>The night was cold and gloomy. He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) entered the Park by the first gate and walked along under the gaunt trees.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) walked through the bleak alleys where they had walked four years before. She (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) seemed to be near him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) in the darkness.
<p/>At moments he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) seemed to feel her (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) voice touch his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) ear, her (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) hand touch his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) stood still to listen. Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) withheld life from her (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>)?
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) gained the crest of the Magazine Hill he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) halted and looked along the river towards Dublin, the lights of which burned redly and hospitably in the cold night.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) looked down the slope and, at the base, in the shadow of the wall of the Park, he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) saw some human figures lying.
<p/>Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) sentenced her (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) to death? He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) moral nature falling to pieces. Those venal and furtive loves filled him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) with despair.
<p/>One human being had seemed to love him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) had denied her (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) life and happiness: he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) had sentenced her (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) to ignominy, a death of shame.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) gnawed the rectitude of his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) life; he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) had been outcast from life's feast. He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) knew that the prostrate creatures down by the wall were watching him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) and wished him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) gone.
<p/>No one wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) was outcast from life's feast. He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) eyes to the grey gleaming river, winding along towards Dublin.
<p/>Beyond the river he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) saw a goods train winding out of Kingsbridge Station, like a worm with a fiery head winding through the darkness, obstinately and laboriously.
<p/>It passed slowly out of sight; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) heard in his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) ears the laborious drone of the engine reiterating the syllables of her (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) name.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) turned back the way he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) had come, the rhythm of the engine pounding in his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) ears. He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) began to doubt the reality of what memory told him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) halted under a tree and allowed the rhythm to die away. He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) could not feel her (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) near him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) in the darkness nor her (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) voice touch his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) ear.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) waited for some minutes listening. He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) could hear nothing: the night was perfectly silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) listened again: perfectly silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) was alone.
<p/>ROOM OLD JACK raked the cinders together with a piece of cardboard and spread them judiciously over the whitening dome of coals.
<p/>When the dome was thinly covered his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) face lapsed into darkness but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) set himself to fan the fire again, his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) crouching shadow ascended the opposite wall and his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) face slowly re-emerged into light.
<p/>The moist blue eyes blinked at the fire and the moist mouth fell open at times, munching once or twice mechanically when it closed.
<p/>When the cinders had caught he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) laid the piece of cardboard against the wall, sighed and said: <div class="bookquote">``That's better now, Mr. O'Connor.
<p/>Mr. O'Connor, a grey-haired young man, whose face was disfigured by many blotches and pimples, had just brought the tobacco for a cigarette into a shapely cylinder but when spoken to he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) undid his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) handiwork meditatively.

<p/>Mr. O'Connor put his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) cigarette into his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) mouth and began search his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) pockets. He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) took out a pack of thin pasteboard cards.
<p/>'' I'll get you a match,'' said the old man. '' Never mind, this'll do,'' said Mr. O'Connor. He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) selected one of the cards and read what was printed on it: MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS ----------
<p/>Mr. Richard J. Tierney, P.L.G., respectfully solicits the favour of your vote and influence at the coming election in the Royal Exchange Ward.
<p/>Mr. O'Connor had been engaged by Tierney's agent to canvass one part of the ward but, as the weather was inclement and his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) boots let in the wet, he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) spent a great part of the day sitting by the fire in the Committee Room in Wicklow Street with Jack, the old caretaker.
<p/>ROYAL EXCHANGE WARD ---------- They had been sitting thus since the short day had grown dark. It was the sixth of October, dismal and cold out of doors.
<p/>Mr. O'Connor tore a strip off the card and, lighting it, lit his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) cigarette. As he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) did so the flame lit up a leaf of dark glossy ivy the lapel of his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) coat.
<p/>The old man watched him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attentively and then, taking up the piece of cardboard again, began to fan the fire slowly while his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) companion smoked.
<p/>'' Ah, yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) said, continuing, <div class="bookquote">``it's hard to know what way to bring up children. Now who'd think he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>)'d turn out like that!
<p/>I sent him (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) to the Christian Brothers and I done what I could for him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>), and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) goes boosing about.
<p/>I tried to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) someway decent. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) replaced the cardboard wearily. '' Only I'm an old man now I'd change his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tune for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>I'd take the stick to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back and beat him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) while I could stand over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--as I done many a time before.
<p/>The mother, you know, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cocks him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up with this and that...'' '' That's what ruins children,'' said Mr. O'Connor. ''
<p/>To be sure it is,'' said the old man. '' And little thanks you get for it, only impudence. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes th`upper hand of me whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees I've a sup taken.
<p/>What's the world coming to when sons speaks that way to their father? '' '' What age is he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?'' said Mr. O'Connor.
<p/>'' Nineteen,'' said the old man. '' Why don't you put him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to something?'' <div class="bookquote">``Sure, amn't I never done at the drunken bowsy ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left school? '
<p/>I won't keep you,' I says. ' You must get a job for yourself.' But, sure, it's worse whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gets a job; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drinks it all.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. O'Connor</b></font>)</div>Mr. O'Connor shook his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) head in sympathy, and the old man fell silent, gazing into the fire. Someone opened the door of the room and called out:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello! Is this a Freemasons' meeting?''  (<font color='red'><b>Someone</b></font>)</div>'' Who's that?'' said the old man. '' What are you doing in the dark?'' asked a voice.
<p/>'' Is that you, Hynes?'' asked Mr. O'Connor. '' Yes. What are you doing in the dark?'' said Mr. Hynes. advancing into the light of the fire.
<p/>Imminent little drops of rain hung at the brim of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) hat and the collar of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) jacket-coat was turned up.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) was a tall, slender young man with a light brown moustache. '' Well, Mat ,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mat</b></font>) said to Mr. O'Connor, <div class="bookquote">``how goes it?
<p/>The old man left the hearth and, after stumbling about the room returned with two candlesticks which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thrust one after the other into the fire and carried to the table.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. O'Connor</b></font>)</div>Mr. O'Connor shook his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) head. A denuded room came into view and the fire lost all its cheerful colour. The walls of the room were bare except for a copy of an election address.
<p/>In the middle of the room was a small table on which papers were heaped. Mr. Hynes leaned against the mantelpiece and asked: <div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) paid you yet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hynes/Hynes</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. O'Connor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. O'Connor. '' I hope to God he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>)'ll not leave us in the lurch tonight. '' Mr. Hynes laughed.
<p/>'' O, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>)'ll pay you. Never fear,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) said. '' I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>)'ll look smart about it if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) means business,'' said Mr. O'Connor.
<p/>'' What do you think, Jack?'' said Mr. Hynes satirically to the old man. The old man returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seat by the fire, saying: <div class="bookquote">``It isn't but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has it, anyway.
<p/>Not like the other tinker. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What other tinker?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hynes/Hynes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hynes. '' Colgan,'' said the old man scornfully. '' It is because Colgan's a working-man you say that?
<p/>Hasn't the working-man as good a right to be in the Corporation as anyone else--ay, and a better right than those shoneens that are always hat in hand before any fellow with a handle to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) name?
<p/>What's the difference between a good honest bricklayer and a publican--eh? Isn't that so, Mat?'' said Mr. Hynes, addressing Mr. O'Connor.
<p/>'' I think you're right,'' said Mr. O'Connor. '' One man is a plain honest man with no hunker-sliding about him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) goes in to represent the labour classes. This fellow you're working for only wants to get some job or other.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, the working-classes should be represented,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man. '' The working-man,'' said Mr. Hynes, <div class="bookquote">``gets all kicks and no halfpence.
<p/>But it's labour produces everything. The working-man is not looking for fat jobs for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) sons and nephews and cousins. The working-man is not going to drag the honour of Dublin in the mud to please a German monarch.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hynes/Hynes</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man. '' Don't you know they want to present an address of welcome to Edward Rex if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rex</b></font>) comes here next year?
<p/>What do we want kowtowing to a foreign king?'' '' Our man won't vote for the address,'' said Mr. O'Connor. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) goes in on the Nationalist ticket.'' <div class="bookquote">``Won't he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hynes/Hynes</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hynes. '' Wait till you see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) will or not.
<p/>I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>). Is it Tricky Dicky Tierney?'' <div class="bookquote">``By God! perhaps you're right, Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. O'Connor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. O'Connor. '' Anyway, I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>)'d turn up with the spondulics.
<p/>Mr. Hynes took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) hat, shook it and then turned down the collar of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) coat, displaying, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) did so, an ivy leaf in the lapel.
<p/>'' The three men fell silent. The old man began to rake more cinders together. '' If this man was alive,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, pointing to the leaf, <div class="bookquote">``we'd have no talk of an address of welcome.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' That's true,'' said Mr. O'Connor. '' Musha, God be with them times!'' said the old man. '' There was some life in it then.
<p/>'' The room was silent again. Then a bustling little man with a snuffling nose and very cold ears pushed in the door.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked over quickly to the fire, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intended to produce a spark from them. ''
<p/>O, don't stir, Jack, don't stir,'' said Mr. Henchy He (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) nodded curtly to Mr. Hynes and sat down on the chair which the old man vacated.
<p/>No money, boys,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. '' Sit down here, Mr. Henchy,'' said the old man, offering him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair. '' ''
<p/>Did you serve Aungier Street? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked Mr. O'Connor. '' Yes,'' said Mr. O'Connor, beginning to search his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) pockets for memoranda.
<p/>'' Did you call on Grimes?'' <div class="bookquote">``I did. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well? How does he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) stand?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) wouldn't promise. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) said: 'I won't tell anyone what way I'm going to vote.'
<p/>But I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>)'ll be all right. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why so?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) asked me who the nominators were; and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>).
<p/>I mentioned Father Burke's name. I think it'll be all right. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Henchy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Henchy began to snuffle and to rub his (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) hands over the fire at a terrific speed.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``For the love of God, Jack, bring us a bit of coal. There must be some left. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The old man went out of the room. '' It's no go,'' said Mr. Henchy, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) head. '' I asked the little shoeboy, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) said: `Oh, now, Mr. Henchy, when I see work going on properly
<p/>I won't forget you, you may be sure.' Mean little tinker! ' Usha, how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) be anything else?'' '' What did I tell you, Mat?'' said Mr. Hynes.
<p/>'' Tricky Dicky Tierney. '' <div class="bookquote">``O, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>)'s as tricky as they make 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Henchy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Henchy. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) hasn't got those little pigs' eyes for nothing.
<p/>Blast his (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) soul! Couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) pay up like a man instead of: `O, now, Mr. Henchy, I must speak to Mr. Fanning....
<p/>I've spent a lot of money'? Mean little school-boy of hell! I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) forgets the time his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) little old father kept the hand-me-down shop in Mary's Lane.
<p/>'' '' But is that a fact?'' asked Mr. O'Connor. '' God, yes,'' said Mr. Henchy. '' Did you never hear that?
<p/>And the men used to go in on Sunday morning before the houses were open to buy a waistcoat or a trousers--moya!
<p/>But Tricky Dicky's little old father always had a tricky little black bottle up in a corner. Do you mind now?
<p/>That's that. That's where he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) first saw the light. '' The old man returned with a few lumps of coal which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) placed here and there on the fire.
<p/>'' Thats a nice how-do-you-do,'' said Mr. O'Connor. '' How does he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) expect us to work for him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) won't stump up?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't help it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Henchy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Henchy. '' I expect to find the bailiffs in the hall when I go home.
<p/>'' Mr. Hynes laughed and, shoving himself away from the mantelpiece with the aid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) shoulders, made ready to leave.
<p/>'' It'll be all right when King Eddie comes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Eddie</b></font>) said. '' Well boys, I'm off for the present. See you later. '
<p/>Neither Mr. Henchy nor the old man said anything, but, just as the door was closing, Mr. O'Connor, who had been staring moodily into the fire, called out suddenly:
<p/>Bye, `bye. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) went out of the room slowly. ''`Bye, Joe. '' Mr. Henchy waited a few moments and then nodded in the direction of the door.
<p/>`Usha, poor Joe!'' said Mr. O'Connor, throwing the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) cigarette into the fire, ``he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>)'s hard up, like the rest of us.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) said across the fire, <div class="bookquote">``what brings our friend in here?

''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' Mr. Henchy snuffled vigorously and spat so copiously that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) nearly put out the fire, which uttered a hissing protest.
<p/>'' To tell you my private and candid opinion,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>)'s a man from the other camp. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>)'s a spy of Colgan's, if you ask me.

<p/>'' His (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) father was a decent, respectable man,'' Mr. Henchy admitted. '' Poor old Larry Hynes! Many a good turn he (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) did in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) day!
<p/>But I'm greatly afraid our friend is not nineteen carat. Damn it, I can understand a fellow being hard up, but what I can't understand is a fellow sponging.
<p/>Couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) have some spark of manhood about him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) doesn't get a warm welcome from me when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) comes,'' said the old man.
<p/>'' Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own side and not come spying around here.'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. O'Connor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. O'Connor dubiously, as he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) took out cigarette-papers and tobacco.
<p/>'' I think Joe Hynes is a straight man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>)'s a clever chap, too, with the pen. Do you remember that thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) wrote...?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some of these hillsiders and fenians are a bit too clever if you ask me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Henchy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Henchy. '' Do you know what my private and candid opinion is about some of those little jokers?
<p/>I believe half of them are in the pay of the Castle. '' '' There's no knowing,'' said the old man.
<p/>'' O, but I know it for a fact,'' said Mr. Henchy. '' They're Castle hacks.... I don't say Hynes.... No, damn it
<p/>, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>)'s a stroke above that.... But there's a certain little nobleman with a cock-eye--you know the patriot I'm alluding to?''
<p/>Mr. O'Connor nodded. '' There's a lineal descendant of Major Sirr for you if you like! O, the heart's blood of a patriot!
<p/>that'd sell his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) country for fourpence--ay--and go down on his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) bended knees and thank the Almighty Christ he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) had a country to sell.
<p/>That's a fellow now '' There was a knock at the door. <div class="bookquote">``Come in!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Henchy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Henchy. A person resembling a poor clergyman or a poor actor appeared in the doorway.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) black clothes were tightly buttoned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) short body and it was impossible to say whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) wore a clergyman's collar or a layman's, because the collar of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) shabby frock-coat, the uncovered buttons of which reflected the candlelight, was turned up about his (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) neck.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) wore a round hat of hard black felt. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) face, shining with raindrops, had the appearance of damp yellow cheese save where two rosy spots indicated the cheekbones.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) very long mouth suddenly to express disappointment and at the same time opened wide his (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) very bright blue eyes to express pleasure and surprise.
<p/>'' O Father Keon!'' said Mr. Henchy, jumping up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) chair. '' Is that you? Come in!'' <div class="bookquote">``O, no, no, no!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Keon/Keon</b></font>)</div>said Father Keon quickly, pursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Keon</b></font>) lips as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Keon</b></font>) were addressing a child. '' Won't you come in and sit down?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Keon/Keon</b></font>)</div>said Father Keon, speaking in a discreet, indulgent, velvety voice. '' Don't let me disturb you now! I'm just looking for Mr. Fanning...''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)'s round at the Black Eagle,'' said Mr. Henchy. '' But won't you come in and sit down a minute?''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) retreated from the doorway and Mr. Henchy, seizing one of the candlesticks, went to the door to light him (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) downstairs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, thank you. It was just a little business matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Father Keon/Keon</b></font>)</div>said Father Keon. '' Thank you, indeed. '' '' O, don't trouble, I beg!''
<p/>'' No, but the stairs is so dark. '' <div class="bookquote">``No, no, I can see.... Thank you, indeed.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you right now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' All right, thanks.... Thanks. '' Mr. Henchy returned with the candlestick and put it on the table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) sat down again at the fire.
<p/>There was silence for a few moments. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me, John,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. O'Connor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. O'Connor, lighting his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) cigarette with another pasteboard card. <div class="bookquote">``Hm?''

<p/>That'll be all right, Mr. H.,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) said. Yerra, sure the little hop-o'-my-thumb has forgotten all about it.'' '' There's some deal on in that quarter,'' said Mr. O'Connor thoughtfully.

<p/>'' You must owe the City Fathers money nowadays if you want to be made Lord Mayor. Then they'll make you Lord Mayor.

<p/>'' Won't you let us drink them first?'' said Mr. Henchy. '' I was told to ask for the bottles.'' <div class="bookquote">``Come back tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man.
<p/>Here, boy!'' said Mr. Henchy, ``will you run over to O'Farrell's and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) to lend us a corkscrew--for Mr. Henchy, say.
<p/>The boy went out and Mr. Henchy began to rub his (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) hands cheerfully, saying: <div class="bookquote">``Ah, well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>)'s not so bad after all.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Henchy</b></font>)</div>Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) we won't keep it a minute. Leave the basket there. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>)'s as good as his (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) word, anyhow.''
<p/>'' There's no tumblers,'' said the old man. '' O, don't let that trouble you, Jack,'' said Mr. Henchy. '' Many's the good man before now drank out of the bottle.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Anyway, it's better than nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. O'Connor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. O'Connor. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>)'s not a bad sort,'' said Mr. Henchy, ``only Fanning has such a loan of him (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>).
<p/>The old man opened three bottles and was handing back the corkscrew when Mr. Henchy said to the boy: <div class="bookquote">``Would you like a drink, boy?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) means well, you know, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) own tinpot way. '' The boy came back with the corkscrew. '' If you please, sir,'' said the boy.
<p/>The old man opened another bottle grudgingly, and handed it to the boy. '' What age are you?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked. ''
<p/>As the old man said nothing further, the boy took the bottle and said: <div class="bookquote">``Here's my best respects, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>to Mr. Henchy, drank the contents, put the bottle back on the table and wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) mouth with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) sleeve.
<p/>Seventeen,'' said the boy. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took up the corkscrew and went out of the door sideways, muttering some form of salutation.
<p/>'' That's the way it begins,'' said the old man. '' The thin edge of the wedge,'' said Mr. Henchy. The old man distributed the three bottles which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) had opened and the men drank from them simultaneously.
<p/>After having drunk each placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) bottle on the mantelpiece within hand's reach and drew in a long breath of satisfaction.
<p/>'' Well, I did a good day's work today,'' said Mr. Henchy, after a pause. '' That so, John?'' '' Yes.
<p/>I got him (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) one or two sure things in Dawson Street, Crofton and myself. Between ourselves, you know, Crofton -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Crofton</b></font>)'s a decent chap, of course-RRB-, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Crofton</b></font>)'s not worth a damn as a canvasser.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Crofton</b></font>) hasn't a word to throw to a dog. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crofton</b></font>) stands and looks at the people while I do the talking.
<p/>One of them was a very fat man whose blue serge clothes seemed to be in danger of falling from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sloping figure.
<p/>'' Here two men entered the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a big face which resembled a young ox's face in expression, staring blue eyes and a grizzled moustache.
<p/>The other man, who was much younger and frailer, had a thin, clean-shaven face. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore a very high double collar and a wide-brimmed bowler hat.
<p/>'' Hello, Crofton!'' said Mr. Henchy to the fat man. '' Talk of the devil...'' <div class="bookquote">``Where did the boose come from?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the devil</b></font>)</div>asked the young man. '' Did the cow calve?'' <div class="bookquote">``O, of course, Lyons spots the drink first thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. O'Connor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. O'Connor, laughing.
<p/>Is that the way you chaps canvass,'' said Mr. Lyons, ``and Crofton and I out in the cold and rain looking for votes?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, blast your soul,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Henchy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Henchy, <div class="bookquote">``I'd get more votes in five minutes than you two'd get in a week.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Henchy</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Open two bottles of stout, Jack,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. O'Connor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. O'Connor. '' How can I?'' said the old man, <div class="bookquote">``when there's no corkscrew?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait now, wait now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Henchy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Henchy, getting up quickly. '' Did you ever see this little trick? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) took two bottles from the table and, carrying them to the fire, put them on the hob.
<p/>Mr. Lyons sat on the edge of the table, pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) hat towards the nape of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) neck and began to swing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) legs.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) sat down again by the fire and took another drink from his (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) bottle. '' Which is my bottle? ''
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) asked. '' This lad,'' said Mr. Henchy. Mr. Crofton sat down on a box and looked fixedly at the other bottle on the hob.
<p/>The first reason, sufficient in itself, was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crofton</b></font>) had nothing to say; the second reason was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crofton</b></font>) considered his (<font color='blue'><b>Crofton</b></font>) companions beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Crofton</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Crofton</b></font>) had been a canvasser for Wilkins, the Conservative, but when the Conservatives had withdrawn their man and, choosing the lesser of two evils, given their support to the Nationalist candidate, he (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>) had been engaged to work for Mr. Tiemey.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was silent for two reasons. In a few minutes an apologetic <div class="bookquote">``Pok!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lyons/Lyons</b></font>)</div>was heard as the cork flew out of Mr. Lyons' bottle.
<p/>Mr. Lyons jumped off the table, went to the fire, took his (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) bottle and carried it back to the table. ''
<p/>I was just telling them, Crofton,'' said Mr. Henchy, <div class="bookquote">``that we got a good few votes today. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Henchy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Who did you get?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lyons/Lyons</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Lyons.
<p/>'' Well, I got Parkes for one, and I got Atkinson for two, and got Ward of Dawson Street. Fine old chap he (<font color='blue'><b>Dawson</b></font>) is, too--regular old toff, old Conservative! '
<p/>But isn't your candidate a Nationalist?' said he (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>). ' He (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>)'s a respectable man,' said I. `He (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>)'s in favour of whatever will benefit this country.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>) has extensive house property in the city and three places of business and isn't it to his (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>) own advantage to keep down the rates?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>)'s a prominent and respected citizen,' said I, `and a Poor Law Guardian, and he (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>) doesn't belong to any party, good, bad, or indifferent.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>candidate</b></font>)'s a big ratepayer,' I said. ' That's the way to talk to 'em.'' <div class="bookquote">``And what about the address to the King?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lyons/Lyons</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lyons, after drinking and smacking his (<font color='blue'><b>Lyons</b></font>) lips.
<p/>'' Listen to me,'' said Mr. Henchy. '' What we want in this country, as I said to old Ward, is capital.
<p/>The King's coming here will mean an influx of money into this country. The citizens of Dublin will benefit by it.
<p/>Look at all the money there is in the country if we only worked the old industries, the mills, the ship-building yards and factories.
<p/>Look at all the factories down by the quays there, idle! It's capital we want.'' '' But look here, John,'' said Mr. O'Connor.
<p/>'' Why should we welcome the King of England? Didn't Parnell himself...'' <div class="bookquote">``Parnell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Parnell/PARNELL</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Henchy, <div class="bookquote">``is dead. Now, here's the way I look at it.
<p/>Here's this chap come to the throne after his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) old mother keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) out of it till the man was grey.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s a man of the world, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) means well by us. He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s a jolly fine decent fellow, if you ask me, and no damn nonsense about him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) just says to himself: `The old one never went to see these wild Irish. By Christ, I'll go myself and see what they're like.'
<p/>And are we going to insult the man when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes over here on a friendly visit? Eh? Isn't that right, Crofton?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Henchy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Crofton nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Crofton</b></font>) head. '' But after all now,'' said Mr. Lyons argumentatively, <div class="bookquote">``King Edward's life, you know, is not the very...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lyons/Lyons</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Let bygones be bygones,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lyons/Lyons</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Henchy. '' I admire the man personally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>)'s just an ordinary knockabout like you and me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>)'s fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) glass of grog and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>)'s a bit of a rake, perhaps, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>)'s a good sportsman. Damn it, can't we Irish play fair?''
<p/>'' That's all very fine,'' said Mr. Lyons. '' But look at the case of Parnell now.'' <div class="bookquote">``In the name of God,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Henchy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Henchy, <div class="bookquote">``where's the analogy between the two cases?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Henchy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What I mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lyons/Lyons</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Lyons, <div class="bookquote">``is we have our ideals. Why, now, would we welcome a man like that?
<p/>Do you think now after what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did Parnell was a fit man to lead us? And why, then, would we do it for Edward the Seventh?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Lyons/Lyons</b></font>)</div><p/>'' This is Parnell's anniversary,'' said Mr. O'Connor, <div class="bookquote">``and don't let us stir up any bad blood. We all respect him (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) now that he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>)'s dead and gone--even the Conservatives,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. O'Connor</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) added, turning to Mr. Crofton.
<p/>Pok! The tardy cork flew out of Mr. Crofton's bottle. Mr. Crofton got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Crofton</b></font>) box and went to the fire.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Crofton</b></font>) returned with his (<font color='blue'><b>Crofton</b></font>) capture he (<font color='blue'><b>Crofton</b></font>) said in a deep voice: <div class="bookquote">``Our side of the house respects him (<font color='blue'><b>Crofton</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>Crofton</b></font>) was a gentleman.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Right you are, Crofton!'' said Mr. Henchy fiercely. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) was the only man that could keep that bag of cats in order. '
<p/>Down, ye dogs! Lie down, ye curs!' That's the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>) treated them. Come in, Joe! Come in!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Joe</b></font>) called out, catching sight of Mr. Hynes in the doorway.
<p/>Mr. Hynes came in slowly. '' Open another bottle of stout, Jack,'' said Mr. Henchy. '' O, I forgot there's no corkscrew!
<p/>Here, show me one here and I'll put it at the fire. '' The old man handed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) another bottle and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) placed it on the hob.
<p/>'' Sit down, Joe,'' said Mr. O'Connor, <div class="bookquote">``we're just talking about the Chief. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. O'Connor</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Henchy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Henchy. Mr. Hynes sat on the side of the table near Mr. Lyons but said nothing.
<p/>'' There's one of them, anyhow,'' said Mr. Henchy, <div class="bookquote">``that didn't renege him (<font color='blue'><b>Henchy</b></font>). By God, I'll say for you, Joe! No, by God, you stuck to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) like a man!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Henchy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, Joe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. O'Connor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. O'Connor suddenly. <div class="bookquote">``Give us that thing you wrote--do you remember? Have you got it on you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O, ay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Henchy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Henchy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give us that. Did you ever hear that, Crofton? Listen to this now: splendid thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. O'Connor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. O'Connor. ''
<p/>Mr. Hynes did not seem to remember at once the piece to which they were alluding, but, after reflecting a while, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``O, that thing is it....
<p/>Fire away, Joe. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Sure, that's old now. '' <div class="bookquote">``Out with it, man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. O'Connor</b></font>)</div>said Mr. O'Connor. '' ' Sh, `sh,'' said Mr. Henchy.
<p/>'' Now, Joe! '' Mr. Hynes hesitated a little longer. Then amid the silence he (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) hat, laid it on the table and stood up.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) seemed to be rehearsing the piece in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) mind. After a rather long pause he (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) announced: THE DEATH OF PARNELL 6th October, 1891
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) throat once or twice and then began to recite: He (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) is dead. Our Uncrowned King is dead. O, Erin, mourn with grief and woe
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) lies slain by the coward hounds He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) raised to glory from the mire; And Erin's hopes and Erin's dreams Perish upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Erin</b></font>) monarch's pyre.
<p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) lies dead whom the fell gang Of modern hypocrites laid low. In palace, cabin or in cot The Irish heart
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) would have had his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) Erin famed, The green flag gloriously unfurled, Her (<font color='blue'><b>Erin</b></font>) statesmen, bards and warriors raised Before the nations of the World.
<p/>where'er it be Is bowed with woe--for he (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) is gone Who would have wrought her (<font color='blue'><b>Erin</b></font>) destiny. He (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) dreamed -LRB-alas, 'twas but a dream!-RRB-
<p/>Shame on the coward, caitiff hands That smote their Lord or with a kiss Betrayed him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to the rabble-rout Of fawning priests--no friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>).
<p/>Of Liberty: but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) strove To clutch that idol, treachery Sundered him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) from the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) loved. May everlasting shame consume
<p/>The memory of those who tried To befoul and smear the exalted name Of one who spurned them in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) pride.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) fell as fall the mighty ones, Nobly undaunted to the last, And death has now united him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) With Erin's heroes of the past.
<p/>No sound of strife disturb his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) sleep! Calmly he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) rests: no human pain Or high ambition spurs him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) now The peaks of glory to attain.
<p/>But Erin, list, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) spirit may Rise, like the Phoenix from the flames, When breaks the dawning of the day, The day that brings us Freedom's reign.
<p/>They had their way: they laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) low. And on that day may Erin well Pledge in the cup she (<font color='blue'><b>Erin</b></font>) lifts to Joy One grief--the memory of Parnell.
<p/>Mr. Hynes sat down again on the table. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) recitation there was a silence and then a burst of clapping: even Mr. Lyons clapped.
<p/>The applause continued for a little time. When it had ceased all the auditors drank from their bottles in silence. Pok!
<p/>The cork flew out of Mr. Hynes' bottle, but Mr. Hynes remained sitting flushed and bare-headed on the table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hynes</b></font>) did not seem to have heard the invitation.
<p/>'' Good man, Joe!'' said Mr. O'Connor, taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) cigarette papers and pouch the better to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>O'Connor</b></font>) emotion. ''
<p/>What do you think of that, Crofton?'' cried Mr. Henchy. '' Isn't that fine? What? '' Mr. Crofton said that it was a very fine piece of writing.
<p/>A MOTHER MR HOLOHAN, assistant secretary of the Eire Abu Society, had been walking up and down Dublin for nearly a month, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Abu</b></font>) hands and pockets full of dirty pieces of paper, arranging about the series of concerts.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Abu</b></font>) walked up and down constantly, stood by the hour at street corners arguing the point and made notes; but in the end it was Mrs. Kearney who arranged everything.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Abu</b></font>) had a game leg and for this his (<font color='blue'><b>Abu</b></font>) friends called him (<font color='blue'><b>Abu</b></font>) Hoppy Holohan. Miss Devlin had become Mrs. Kearney out of spite.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Devlin</b></font>) had been educated in a high-class convent, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Devlin</b></font>) had learned French and music. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Devlin</b></font>) was naturally pale and unbending in manner she (<font color='blue'><b>Devlin</b></font>) made few friends at school.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Devlin</b></font>) came to the age of marriage she (<font color='blue'><b>Devlin</b></font>) was sent out to many houses where her (<font color='blue'><b>Devlin</b></font>) playing and ivory manners were much admired.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Devlin</b></font>) sat amid the chilly circle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Devlin</b></font>) accomplishments, waiting for some suitor to brave it and offer her (<font color='blue'><b>Devlin</b></font>) a brilliant life.
<p/>But the young men whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Devlin</b></font>) met were ordinary and she (<font color='blue'><b>Devlin</b></font>) gave them no encouragement, trying to console her (<font color='blue'><b>Devlin</b></font>) romantic desires by eating a great deal of Turkish Delight in secret.
<p/>However, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Devlin</b></font>) drew near the limit and her (<font color='blue'><b>Devlin</b></font>) friends began to loosen their tongues about her (<font color='blue'><b>Devlin</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Devlin</b></font>) silenced them by marrying Mr. Kearney, who was a bootmaker on Ormond Quay.
<p/>After the first year of married life, Mrs. Kearney perceived that such a man would wear better than a romantic person, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) never put her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) own romantic ideas away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was much older than she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conversation, which was serious, took place at intervals in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) great brown beard. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sober, thrifty and pious; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to the altar every first Friday, sometimes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>), oftener by himself.
<p/>At some party in a strange house when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) eyebrow ever so slightly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood up to take his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leave and,
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) never weakened in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) religion and was a good wife to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cough troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) put the eider-down quilt over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet and made a strong rum punch.
<p/>By paying a small sum every week into a society, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ensured for both his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughters a dowry of one hundred pounds each when they came to the age of twenty-four.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sent the older daughter, Kathleen, to a good convent, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Kathleen</b></font>) learned French and music, and afterward paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathleen</b></font>) fees at the Academy.
<p/>Every year in the month of July Mrs. Kearney found occasion to say to some friend: <div class="bookquote">``My good man is packing us off to Skerries for a few weeks.
<p/>When the Irish Revival began to be appreciable Mrs. Kearney determined to take advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) daughter's name and brought an Irish teacher to the house.
<p/>For his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) part, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a model father. ''  (<font color='red'><b>some friend</b></font>)</div>If it was not Skerries it was Howth or Greystones. Kathleen and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathleen</b></font>) sister sent Irish picture postcards to their friends and these friends sent back other Irish picture postcards.
<p/>On special Sundays, when Mr. Kearney went with his (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) family to the pro-cathedral, a little crowd of people would assemble after mass at the corner of Cathedral Street.
<p/>They were all friends of the Kearneys--musical friends or Nationalist friends; and, when they had played every little counter of gossip, they shook hands with one another all together, laughing at the crossing of so many hands, and said good-bye to one another in Irish.
<p/>People said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) was very clever at music and a very nice girl and, moreover, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) was a believer in the language movement.
<p/>Soon the name of Miss Kathleen Kearney began to be heard often on people's lips. Mrs. Kearney was well content at this.
<p/>Therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) was not surprised when one day Mr. Holohan came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) and proposed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) daughter should be the accompanist at a series of four grand concerts which his (<font color='blue'><b>Holohan</b></font>) Society was going to give in the Antient Concert Rooms.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) entered heart and soul into the details of the enterprise, advised and dissuaded: and finally a contract was drawn up by which Kathleen was to receive eight guineas for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathleen</b></font>) services as accompanist at the four grand concerts.
<p/>As Mr. Holohan was a novice in such delicate matters as the wording of bills and the disposing of items for a programme, Mrs. Kearney helped him (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) brought him (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) into the drawing-room, made him (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) sit down and brought out the decanter and the silver biscuit-barrel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) had tact.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) knew what artistes should go into capitals and what artistes should go into small type. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) knew that the first tenor would not like to come on after Mr. Meade's comic turn.
<p/>To keep the audience continually diverted she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) slipped the doubtful items in between the old favourites. Mr. Holohan called to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) every day to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) advice on some point.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) was invariably friendly and advising--homely, in fact. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) pushed the decanter towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Holohan</b></font>), saying: <div class="bookquote">``Now, help yourself, Mr. Holohan!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And while he (<font color='blue'><b>Holohan</b></font>) was helping himself she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Don't be afraid!
<p/>Don't be afraid of it! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Everything went on smoothly. Mrs. Kearney bought some lovely blush-pink charmeuse in Brown Thomas's to let into the front of Kathleen's dress.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kathleen</b></font>) took a dozen of two-shilling tickets for the final concert and sent them to those friends who could not be trusted to come otherwise.
<p/>It cost a pretty penny; but there are occasions when a little expense is justifiable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kathleen</b></font>) forgot nothing, and, thanks to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathleen</b></font>), everything that was to be done was done.
<p/>When Mrs. Kearney arrived with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) daughter at the Antient Concert Rooms on Wednesday night she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) did not like the look of things.
<p/>A few young men, wearing bright blue badges in their coats, stood idle in the vestibule; none of them wore evening dress.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) passed by with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) daughter and a quick glance through the open door of the hall showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) the cause of the stewards' idleness.
<p/>The concerts were to be on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday. At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) wondered had she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) mistaken the hour. No, it was twenty minutes to eight.
<p/>In the dressing-room behind the stage she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) was introduced to the secretary of the Society, Mr. Fitzpatrick. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) smiled and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) hand.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) soft brown hat carelessly on the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) head and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) accent was flat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) held a programme in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) hand, and, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) was talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) chewed one end of it into a moist pulp.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) was a little man, with a white, vacant face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) seemed to bear disappointments lightly. Mr. Holohan came into the dressingroom every few minutes with reports from the box-office.
<p/>The artistes talked among themselves nervously, glanced from time to time at the mirror and rolled and unrolled their music. When it was nearly half-past eight, the few people in the hall began to express their desire to be entertained.
<p/>Mr. Fitzpatrick came in, smiled vacantly at the room, and said: '' Well now, ladies and gentlemen. I suppose we'd better open the ball.
<p/>Mrs. Kearney rewarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) very flat final syllable with a quick stare of contempt, and then said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) daughter encouragingly: <div class="bookquote">``Are you ready, dear?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>'' When she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) had an opportunity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) called Mr. Holohan aside and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Holohan</b></font>) to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) what it meant.
<p/>Mr. Holohan did not know what it meant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holohan</b></font>) said that the Committee had made a mistake in arranging for four concerts: four was too many.
<p/>'' And the artistes!'' said Mrs. Kearney. '' Of course they are doing their best, but really they are not good.
<p/>Mr. Holohan admitted that the artistes were no good but the Committee, he (<font color='blue'><b>Holohan</b></font>) said, had decided to let the first three concerts go as they pleased and reserve all the talent for Saturday night.
<p/>Mrs. Kearney said nothing, but, as the mediocre items followed one another on the platform and the few people in the hall grew fewer and fewer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) began to regret that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) had put herself to any expense for such a concert.
<p/>'' There was something she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) didn't like in the look of things and Mr. Fitzpatrick's vacant smile irritated her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) very much.
<p/>However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) said nothing and waited to see how it would end. The concert expired shortly before ten, and everyone went home quickly.
<p/>The concert on Thursday night was better attended, but Mrs. Kearney saw at once that the house was filled with paper.
<p/>The audience behaved indecorously, as if the concert were an informal dress rehearsal. Mr. Fitzpatrick seemed to enjoy himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) was quite unconscious that Mrs. Kearney was taking angry note of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) conduct.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) stood at the edge of the screen, from time to time jutting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) head and exchanging a laugh with two friends in the corner of the balcony.
<p/>In the course of the evening, Mrs. Kearney learned that the Friday concert was to be abandoned and that the Committee was going to move heaven and earth to secure a bumper house on Saturday night.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) buttonholed him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) was limping out quickly with a glass of lemonade for a young lady and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) was it true.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heard this, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sought out Mr. Holohan. Yes, it was true. '' But, of course, that doesn't alter the contract,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' The contract was for four concerts. '' Mr. Holohan seemed to be in a hurry; he (<font color='blue'><b>Holohan</b></font>) advised her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to speak to Mr. Fitzpatrick.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) called Mr. Fitzpatrick away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) screen and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughter had signed for four concerts and that, of course, according to the terms of the contract, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) should receive the sum originally stipulated for, whether the society gave the four concerts or not.
<p/>Mr. Fitzpatrick, who did not catch the point at issue very quickly, seemed unable to resolve the difficulty and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) would bring the matter before the Committee.
<p/>Mrs. Kearney's anger began to flutter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) cheek and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) had all she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) could do to keep from asking: <div class="bookquote">``And who is the Cometty pray?
<p/>Mrs. Kearney was now beginning to be alarmed. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) knew that it would not be ladylike to do that: so she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) was silent.
<p/>Special puffs appeared in all the evening papers, reminding the music-loving public of the treat which was in store for it on the following evening.
<p/>Little boys were sent out into the principal streets of Dublin early on Friday morning with bundles of handbills. Mrs. Kearney was somewhat reassured, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) thought well to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) husband part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) suspicions.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) listened carefully and said that perhaps it would be better if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) on Saturday night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) agreed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) respected her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) husband in the same way as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) respected the General Post Office, as something large, secure and fixed; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) knew the small number of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) talents she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) appreciated his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) abstract value as a male.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) was glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) had suggested coming with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) plans over. The night of the grand concert came.
<p/>Mrs. Kearney, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) husband and daughter, arrived at the Antient Concert Rooms three-quarters of an hour before the time at which the concert was to begin.
<p/>Mrs. Kearney placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) daughter's clothes and music in charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) husband and went all over the building looking for Mr. Holohan or Mr. Fitzpatrick.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) asked the stewards was any member of the Committee in the hall and, after a great deal of trouble, a steward brought out a little woman named Miss Beirne to whom Mrs. Kearney explained that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) wanted to see one of the secretaries.
<p/>By ill luck it was a rainy evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) could find neither. Miss Beirne expected them any minute and asked could she (<font color='blue'><b>Beirne</b></font>) do anything.
<p/>Mrs. Kearney looked searchingly at the oldish face which was screwed into an expression of trustfulness and enthusiasm and answered: <div class="bookquote">``No, thank you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kearney</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) looked out at the rain until the melancholy of the wet street effaced all the trustfulness and enthusiasm from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) twisted features.
<p/>The little woman hoped they would have a good house. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) gave a little sigh and said: <div class="bookquote">``Ah, well! We did our best, the dear knows.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Kearney had to go back to the dressing-room. The artistes were arriving. The bass and the second tenor had already come.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) was the son of a hall porter in an office in the city and, as a boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had sung prolonged bass notes in the resounding hall.
<p/>The bass, Mr. Duggan, was a slender young man with a scattered black moustache. From this humble state he (<font color='blue'><b>Duggan</b></font>) had raised himself until he (<font color='blue'><b>Duggan</b></font>) had become a first-rate artiste.
<p/>One night, when an operatic artiste had fallen ill, he (<font color='blue'><b>artiste</b></font>) had undertaken the part of the king in the opera of Maritana at the Queen's Theatre.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>artiste</b></font>) sang his (<font color='blue'><b>artiste</b></font>) music with great feeling and volume and was warmly welcomed by the gallery; but, unfortunately, he (<font color='blue'><b>artiste</b></font>) marred the good impression by wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>artiste</b></font>) nose in his (<font color='blue'><b>artiste</b></font>) gloved hand once or twice out of thoughtlessness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>artiste</b></font>) said yous so softly that it passed unnoticed and he (<font color='blue'><b>artiste</b></font>) never drank anything stronger than milk for his (<font color='blue'><b>artiste</b></font>) voice's sake.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>artiste</b></font>) had appeared in grand opera. He (<font color='blue'><b>artiste</b></font>) was unassuming and spoke little. Mr. Bell, the second tenor, was a fair-haired little man who competed every year for prizes at the Feis Ceoil.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) fourth trial he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) had been awarded a bronze medal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) was extremely nervous and extremely jealous of other tenors and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) nervous jealousy with an ebullient friendliness.
<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) humour to have people know what an ordeal a concert was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>). Therefore when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) saw Mr. Duggan he (<font color='blue'><b>Duggan</b></font>) went over to him (<font color='blue'><b>Duggan</b></font>) and asked: <div class="bookquote">``Are you in it too?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes,'' said Mr. Duggan. Mr. Bell laughed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) fellow-sufferer, held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) hand and said: <div class="bookquote">``Shake!''  (<font color='red'><b>fellow-sufferer</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Kearney passed by these two young men and went to the edge of the screen to view the house.
<p/>The seats were being filled up rapidly and a pleasant noise circulated in the auditorium. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) came back and spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) husband privately.
<p/>Their conversation was evidently about Kathleen for they both glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathleen</b></font>) often as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kathleen</b></font>) stood chatting to one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathleen</b></font>) Nationalist friends, Miss Healy, the contralto.
<p/>An unknown solitary woman with a pale face walked through the room. The women followed with keen eyes the faded blue dress which was stretched upon a meagre body.
<p/>Someone said that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was Madam Glynn, the soprano. '' I wonder where did they dig her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up,'' said Kathleen to Miss Healy.
<p/>Mr. Holohan limped into the dressing-room at that moment and the two young ladies asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Holohan</b></font>) who was the unknown woman.
<p/>'' I'm sure I never heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). '' Miss Healy had to smile. Mr. Holohan said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Healy</b></font>) was Madam Glynn from London.
<p/>Madam Glynn took her (<font color='blue'><b>Glynn</b></font>) stand in a corner of the room, holding a roll of music stiffly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Glynn</b></font>) and from time to time changing the direction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Glynn</b></font>) startled gaze.
<p/>The shadow took her (<font color='blue'><b>Glynn</b></font>) faded dress into shelter but fell revengefully into the little cup behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Glynn</b></font>) collar-bone. The noise of the hall became more audible.
<p/>The first tenor and the baritone arrived together. They were both well dressed, stout and complacent and they brought a breath of opulence among the company.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Glynn</b></font>) wanted to be on good terms with them but, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Glynn</b></font>) strove to be polite, her (<font color='blue'><b>Glynn</b></font>) eyes followed Mr. Holohan in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holohan</b></font>) limping and devious courses.
<p/>Mrs. Kearney brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) daughter over to them, and talked to them amiably. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) could she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) excused herself and went out after him (<font color='blue'><b>Holohan</b></font>).
<p/>'' Mr. Holohan, I want to speak to you for a moment,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) said. They went down to a discreet part of the corridor.
<p/>Mrs Kearney asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Holohan</b></font>) when was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) daughter going to be paid. Mr. Holohan said that Mr. Fitzpatrick had charge of that.
<p/>Mrs. Kearney said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) didn't know anything about Mr. Fitzpatrick. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) daughter had signed a contract for eight guineas and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) would have to be paid.
<p/>Mr. Holohan said that it wasn't his (<font color='blue'><b>Holohan</b></font>) business. '' Why isn't it your business?'' asked Mrs. Kearney. '' Didn't you yourself bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) the contract?
<p/>Anyway, if it's not your business it's my business and I mean to see to it. '' '' You'd better speak to Mr. Fitzpatrick,'' said Mr. Holohan distantly.
<p/>'' I don't know anything about Mr. Fitzpatrick,'' repeated Mrs. Kearney. '' I have my contract, and I intend to see that it is carried out.
<p/>Two men in outdoor dress had taken possession of the fireplace and were chatting familiarly with Miss Healy and the baritone.
<p/>'' When she (<font color='blue'><b>Healy</b></font>) came back to the dressing-room her (<font color='blue'><b>Healy</b></font>) cheeks were slightly suffused. The room was lively. They were the Freeman man and Mr. O'Madden Burke.
<p/>The Freeman man had come in to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not wait for the concert as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to report the lecture which an American priest was giving in the Mansion House.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) said they were to leave the report for him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) at the Freeman office and he (<font color='blue'><b>Freeman</b></font>) would see that it went in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freeman</b></font>) was a grey-haired man, with a plausible voice and careful manners. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freeman</b></font>) held an extinguished cigar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Freeman</b></font>) hand and the aroma of cigar smoke floated near him (<font color='blue'><b>Freeman</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freeman</b></font>) had not intended to stay a moment because concerts and artistes bored him (<font color='blue'><b>Freeman</b></font>) considerably but he (<font color='blue'><b>Freeman</b></font>) remained leaning against the mantelpiece.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freeman</b></font>) was old enough to suspect one reason for her (<font color='blue'><b>Freeman</b></font>) politeness but young enough in spirit to turn the moment to account.
<p/>Miss Healy stood in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>Freeman</b></font>), talking and laughing. The warmth, fragrance and colour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Healy</b></font>) body appealed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Freeman</b></font>) senses.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freeman</b></font>) was pleasantly conscious that the bosom which he (<font color='blue'><b>Freeman</b></font>) saw rise and fall slowly beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Freeman</b></font>) rose and fell at that moment for him (<font color='blue'><b>Freeman</b></font>), that the laughter and fragrance and wilful glances were his (<font color='blue'><b>Freeman</b></font>) tribute.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Freeman</b></font>) could stay no longer he (<font color='blue'><b>Freeman</b></font>) took leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Healy</b></font>) regretfully. '' O'Madden Burke will write the notice,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) explained to Mr. Holohan, <div class="bookquote">``and I'll see it in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Holohan/Holohan</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you very much, Mr. Hendrick,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Holohan/Holohan</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Holohan, <div class="bookquote">``you'll see it in, I know. Now, won't you have a little something before you go?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Holohan/Holohan</b></font>)</div><p/>The two men went along some tortuous passages and up a dark staircase and came to a secluded room where one of the stewards was uncorking bottles for a few gentlemen.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hendrick</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Hendrick. One of these gentlemen was Mr. O'Madden Burke, who had found out the room by instinct.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) was a suave, elderly man who balanced his (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) imposing body, when at rest, upon a large silk umbrella. His (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) magniloquent western name was the moral umbrella upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) balanced the fine problem of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) finances.
<p/>While Mr. Holohan was entertaining the Freeman man Mrs. Kearney was speaking so animatedly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) husband that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holohan</b></font>) had to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) to lower her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) voice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holohan</b></font>) was widely respected. The conversation of the others in the dressing-room had become strained. Mr. Bell, the first item, stood ready with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) music but the accompanist made no sign.
<p/>Evidently something was wrong. Mr. Kearney looked straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>), stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) beard, while Mrs. Kearney spoke into Kathleen's ear with subdued emphasis.
<p/>The first tenor and the baritone and Miss Healy stood together, waiting tranquilly, but Mr. Bell's nerves were greatly agitated because he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) was afraid the audience would think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bell</b></font>) had come late.
<p/>From the hall came sounds of encouragement, clapping and stamping of feet. Mr. Holohan and Mr. O'Madden Burke came into the room.
<p/>In a moment Mr. Holohan perceived the hush. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holohan</b></font>) went over to Mrs. Kearney and spoke with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) earnestly. While they were speaking the noise in the hall grew louder.
<p/>Mr. Holohan became very red and excited. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holohan</b></font>) spoke volubly, but Mrs. Kearney said curtly at intervals: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) won't go on.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) must get her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) eight guineas. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kearney</b></font>)</div>Mr. Holohan pointed desperately towards the hall where the audience was clapping and stamping.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holohan</b></font>) appealed to Mr Kearney and to Kathleen. But Mr. Kearney continued to stroke his (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) beard and Kathleen looked down, moving the point of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathleen</b></font>) new shoe:
<p/>it was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathleen</b></font>) fault. Mrs. Kearney repeated: <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) won't go on without her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) money. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kearney</b></font>)</div>After a swift struggle of tongues Mr. Holohan hobbled out in haste.
<p/>When the strain of the silence had become somewhat painful Miss Healy said to the baritone: <div class="bookquote">``Have you seen Mrs. Pat Campbell this week?
<p/>The room was silent. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the baritone</b></font>)</div>The baritone had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) but he (<font color='blue'><b>baritone</b></font>) had been told that she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was very fine.
<p/>The first tenor bent his (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) head and began to count the links of the gold chain which was extended across his (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) waist, smiling and humming random notes to observe the effect on the frontal sinus.
<p/>The noise in the auditorium had risen to a clamour when Mr. Fitzpatrick burst into the room, followed by Mr. Holohan, who was panting.
<p/>The conversation went no further. From time to time everyone glanced at Mrs. Kearney. The clapping and stamping in the hall were punctuated by whistling.
<p/>Mr. Fitzpatrick held a few banknotes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fitzpatrick</b></font>) counted out four into Mrs. Kearney's hand and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) would get the other half at the interval.
<p/>But Kathleen gathered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathleen</b></font>) skirt and said: <div class="bookquote">``Now, Mr. Bell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kathleen/Miss Kathleen Kearney/Kathleen Kearney</b></font>)</div>to the first item, who was shaking like an aspen.
<p/>Mrs. Kearney said: <div class="bookquote">``This is four shillings short.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kearney</b></font>)</div>The singer and the accompanist went out together. The noise in hall died away.
<p/>There was a pause of a few seconds: and then the piano was heard. The first part of the concert was very successful except for Madam Glynn's item.
<p/>The poor lady sang Killarney in a bodiless gasping voice, with all the old-fashioned mannerisms of intonation and pronunciation which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) believed lent elegance to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) singing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been resurrected from an old stage-wardrobe and the cheaper parts of the hall made fun of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) high wailing notes.
<p/>The first tenor and the contralto, however, brought down the house. Kathleen played a selection of Irish airs which was generously applauded.
<p/>The first part closed with a stirring patriotic recitation delivered by a young lady who arranged amateur theatricals. It was deservedly applauded; and, when it was ended, the men went out for the interval, content.
<p/>In one corner were Mr. Holohan, Mr. Fitzpatrick, Miss Beirne, two of the stewards, the baritone, the bass, and Mr. O'Madden Burke.
<p/>All this time the dressing-room was a hive of excitement. Mr. O'Madden Burke said it was the most scandalous exhibition he (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) had ever witnessed.
<p/>Miss Kathleen Kearney's musical career was ended in Dublin after that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) said. The baritone was asked what did he (<font color='blue'><b>baritone</b></font>) think of Mrs. Kearney's conduct.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>baritone</b></font>) did not like to say anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>baritone</b></font>) had been paid his (<font color='blue'><b>baritone</b></font>) money and wished to be at peace with men.
<p/>However, he (<font color='blue'><b>baritone</b></font>) said that Mrs. Kearney might have taken the artistes into consideration. The stewards and the secretaries debated hotly as to what should be done when the interval came.
<p/>'' In another corner of the room were Mrs. Kearney and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) husband, Mr. Bell, Miss Healy and the young lady who had to recite the patriotic piece.
<p/>'' I agree with Miss Beirne,'' said Mr. O'Madden Burke. <div class="bookquote">``Pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Beirne</b></font>) nothing. Mrs. Kearney said that the Committee had treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) scandalously.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) had spared neither trouble nor expense and this was how she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) was repaid. They thought they had only a girl to deal with and that, therefore, they could ride roughshod over her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>).
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) would show them their mistake. They wouldn't have dared to have treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) like that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) had been a man.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) would see that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) daughter got her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) rights: she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) wouldn't be fooled. If they didn't pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) to the last farthing she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) would make Dublin ring.
<p/>Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) was sorry for the sake of the artistes. But what else could she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) do? She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) appealed to the second tenor who said he (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) had not been well treated.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) appealed to Miss Healy. Miss Healy wanted to join the other group but she (<font color='blue'><b>Healy</b></font>) did not like to do so because she (<font color='blue'><b>Healy</b></font>) was a great friend of Kathleen's and the Kearneys
<p/>As soon as the first part was ended Mr. Fitzpatrick and Mr. Holohan went over to Mrs. Kearney and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) that the other four guineas would be paid after the Committee meeting on the following Tuesday and that, in case her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) daughter did not play for the second part, the Committee would consider the contract broken and would pay nothing.
<p/>had often invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) to their house. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I haven't seen any Committee,'' said Mrs. Kearney angrily. '' My daughter has her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) contract.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) will get four pounds eight into her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) hand or a foot she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) won't put on that platform.'' <div class="bookquote">``I'm surprised at you, Mrs. Kearney,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Holohan/Holohan</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Holohan.
<p/>'' I never thought you would treat us this way.'' '' And what way did you treat me?'' asked Mrs. Kearney.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) face was inundated with an angry colour and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) would attack someone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) hands. ''
<p/>I'm asking for my rights. '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) said. '' You might have some sense of decency,'' said Mr. Holohan. '' Might I, indeed?...
<p/>And when I ask when my daughter is going to be paid I can't get a civil answer. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) head and assumed a haughty voice: <div class="bookquote">``You must speak to the secretary.
<p/>It's not my business. I'm a great fellow fol-the-diddle-I-do. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I thought you were a lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Holohan/Holohan</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Holohan, walking away from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) abruptly.
<p/>After that Mrs. Kearney's conduct was condemned on all hands: everyone approved of what the Committee had done. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) stood at the door, haggard with rage, arguing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) husband and daughter, gesticulating with them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) waited until it was time for the second part to begin in the hope that the secretaries would approach her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>).
<p/>But Miss Healy had kindly consented to play one or two accompaniments. Mrs. Kearney had to stand aside to allow the baritone and his (<font color='blue'><b>baritone</b></font>) accompanist to pass up to the platform.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) stood still for an instant like an angry stone image and, when the first notes of the song struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) ear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) caught up her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) daughter's cloak and said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) husband: <div class="bookquote">``Get a cab!''
 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) went out at once. Mrs. Kearney wrapped the cloak round her (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) daughter and followed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). As she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) passed through the doorway she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) stopped and glared into Mr. Holohan's face.
<p/>'' I'm not done with you yet,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Kearney</b></font>) said. '' But I'm done with you,'' said Mr. Holohan. Kathleen followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kathleen</b></font>) mother meekly.
<p/>Mr. Holohan began to pace up and down the room, in order to cool himself for he (<font color='blue'><b>Holohan</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Holohan</b></font>) skin on fire.
<p/>'' That's a nice lady! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holohan</b></font>) said. '' O, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s a nice lady!'' '' You did the proper thing, Holohan,'' said Mr. O'Madden Burke, poised upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) umbrella in approval.
<p/>GRACE TWO GENTLEMEN who were in the lavatory at the time tried to lift him (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) up: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) was quite helpless.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) lay curled up at the foot of the stairs down which he (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) had fallen. They succeeded in turning him (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) over.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) hat had rolled a few yards away and his (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) clothes were smeared with the filth and ooze of the floor on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) had lain, face downwards.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) eyes were closed and he (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) breathed with a grunting noise. A thin stream of blood trickled from the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>These two gentlemen and one of the curates carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) up the stairs and laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) down again on the floor of the bar.
<p/>In two minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Burke</b></font>) was surrounded by a ring of men. The manager of the bar asked everyone who he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) was and who was with him (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>).
<p/>No one knew who he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) was but one of the curates said he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) had served the gentleman with a small rum.
<p/>'' Was he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) by himself? '' asked the manager. '' No, sir. There was two gentlemen with him (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>).'' '' And where are they?
<p/>'' No one knew; a voice said: <div class="bookquote">``Give him (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) air. He (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>)'s fainted. ''  (<font color='red'><b>onlookers</b></font>)</div>The ring of onlookers distended and closed again elastically.
<p/>A dark medal of blood had formed itself near the man's head on the tessellated floor. The manager, alarmed by the grey pallor of the man's face, sent for a policeman.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) collar was unfastened and his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) necktie undone. He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) opened eyes for an instant, sighed and closed them again. One of gentlemen who had carried him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) upstairs held a dinged silk hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) hand.
<p/>The manager asked repeatedly did no one know who the injured man was or where had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends gone. The door of the bar opened and an immense constable entered.
<p/>A crowd which had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down the laneway collected outside the door, struggling to look in through the glass panels.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moved his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head slowly to right and left and from the manager to the person on the floor, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) feared to be the victim of some delusion.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) drew off his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) glove, produced a small book from his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) waist, licked the lead of his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) pencil and made ready to indite.
<p/>The manager at once began to narrate what he (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) knew. The constable, a young man with thick immobile features, listened. He (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) asked in a suspicious provincial accent: <div class="bookquote">``Who is the man?
<p/>What's his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name and address? ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>A young man in a cycling-suit cleared his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way through the ring of bystanders. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knelt down promptly beside the injured man and called for water.
<p/>The constable knelt down also to help. The young man washed the blood from the injured man's mouth and then called for some brandy.
<p/>The constable repeated the order in an authoritative voice until a curate came running with the glass. The brandy was forced down the man's throat.
<p/>In a few seconds he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes and looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at the circle of faces and then, understanding, strove to rise to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet.
<p/>'' You're all right now?'' asked the young man in the cycling-suit. '' Sha,'s nothing,'' said the injured man, trying to stand up.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was helped to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet. The manager said something about a hospital and some of the bystanders gave advice. The battered silk hat was placed on the man's head.
<p/>The constable asked: <div class="bookquote">``Where do you live?''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man, without answering, began to twirl the ends of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moustache. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made light of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) accident.
<p/>It was nothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said: only a little accident. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke very thickly. '' Where do you live? '' repeated the constable.
<p/>While the point was being debated a tall agile gentleman of fair complexion, wearing a long yellow ulster, came from the far end of the bar.
<p/>The man said they were to get a cab for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Seeing the spectacle, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called out: <div class="bookquote">``Hallo, Tom, old man!
<p/>What's the trouble?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sha,'s nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. The new-comer surveyed the deplorable figure before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and then turned to the constable, saying: <div class="bookquote">``It's all right, constable.
<p/>I'll see him (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) home. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the constable</b></font>)</div>The constable touched his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) helmet and answered: <div class="bookquote">``All right, Mr. Power!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come now, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Power, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) friend by the arm.
<p/>'' No bones broken. What? Can you walk? '' The young man in the cycling-suit took the man by the other arm and the crowd divided.
<p/>'' How did you get yourself into this mess?'' asked Mr. Power. '' The gentleman fell down the stairs,'' said the young man.
<p/>'' I' `ery `uch o'liged to you, sir,'' said the injured man. '' Not at all. '' ''`ant we have a little...?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not now. Not now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div>The three men left the bar and the crowd sifted through the doors in to the laneway.
<p/>The manager brought the constable to the stairs to inspect the scene of the accident. They agreed that the gentleman must have missed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) footing.
<p/>The customers returned to the counter and a curate set about removing the traces of blood from the floor. When they came out into Grafton Street, Mr. Power whistled for an outsider.
<p/>The injured man said again as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could. '' I' `ery `uch o'liged to you, sir. I hope we'll `eet again. '
<p/>y na'e is Kernan. '' The shock and the incipient pain had partly sobered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' Don't mention it,'' said the young man.
<p/>Mr. Kernan was hoisted on to the car and, while Mr. Power was giving directions to the carman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) gratitude to the young man and regretted that they could not have a little drink together.
<p/>They shook hands. '' Another time,'' said the young man. The car drove off towards Westmoreland Street. As it passed Ballast Office the clock showed half-past nine.
<p/>A keen east wind hit them, blowing from the mouth of the river. Mr. Kernan was huddled together with cold. His (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) friend asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) to tell how the accident had happened.
<p/>'' I`an't `an,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) answered, '''y `ongue is hurt.'' <div class="bookquote">``Show. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kernan/Kernan</b></font>)</div>The other leaned over the well of the car and peered into Mr. Kernan's mouth but he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) could not see.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) struck a match and, sheltering it in the shell of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) hands, peered again into the mouth which Mr. Kernan opened obediently.
<p/>The lower teeth and gums were covered with clotted blood and a minute piece of the tongue seemed to have been bitten off.
<p/>The swaying movement of the car brought the match to and from the opened mouth. The match was blown out. ''
<p/>That's ugly,'' said Mr. Power. '' Sha, 's nothing,'' said Mr. Kernan, closing his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) mouth and pulling the collar of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) filthy coat across his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) neck.
<p/>Mr. Kernan was a commercial traveller of the old school which believed in the dignity of its calling. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) had never been seen in the city without a silk hat of some decency and a pair of gaiters.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) carried on the tradition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) Napoleon, the great Blackwhite, whose memory he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) evoked at times by legend and mimicry.
<p/>Modern business methods had spared him (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) only so far as to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) a little office in Crowe Street, on the window blind of which was written the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crowe</b></font>) firm with the address--London, E. C.
<p/>On the mantelpiece of this little office a little leaden battalion of canisters was drawn up and on the table before the window stood four or five china bowls which were usually half full of a black liquid.
<p/>By grace of these two articles of clothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crowe</b></font>) said, a man could always pass muster. From these bowls Mr. Kernan tasted tea.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) took a mouthful, drew it up, saturated his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) palate with it and then spat it forth into the grate. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) paused to judge.
<p/>The arc of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) social rise intersected the arc of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) friend's decline, but Mr. Kernan's decline was mitigated by the fact that certain of those friends who had known him (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) highest point of success still esteemed him (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) as a character.
<p/>Mr. Power, a much younger man, was employed in the Royal Irish Constabulary Office in Dublin Castle. Mr. Power was one of these friends.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) inexplicable debts were a byword in his (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) circle; he (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) was a debonair young man. The car halted before a small house on the Glasnevin road and Mr. Kernan was helped into the house.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) wife put him (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) to bed while Mr. Power sat downstairs in the kitchen asking the children where they went to school and what book they were in.
<p/>The children--two girls and a boy, conscious of their father's helplessness and of their mother's absence, began some horseplay with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was surprised at their manners and at their accents, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) brow grew thoughtful. After a while Mrs. Kernan entered the kitchen, exclaiming: ``Such a sight!
<p/>Mr. Power was careful to explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) was not responsible, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) had come on the scene by the merest accident.
<p/>Mrs. Kernan, remembering Mr. Power's good offices during domestic quarrels, as well as many small, but opportune loans, said: <div class="bookquote">``O, you needn't tell me that, Mr. Power.
<p/>O, he (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>)'ll do for himself one day and that's the holy alls of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>)'s been drinking since Friday. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div>I know you're a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), not like some of the others he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) does be with.
<p/>They're all right so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has money in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pocket to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) out from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife and family.
<p/>Nice friends! Who was he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) with tonight, I'd like to know? '' Mr. Power shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) head but said nothing. ''
<p/>I'm so sorry,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``that I've nothing in the house to offer you. But if you wait a minute I'll send round to Fogarty's at the corner.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mr. Power stood up. '' We were waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) to come home with the money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) never seems to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) has a home at all.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, now, Mrs. Kernan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Power, <div class="bookquote">``we'll make him (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) turn over a new leaf. I'll talk to Martin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>)'s the man.
<p/>We'll come here one of these nights and talk it over. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) to the door. The carman was stamping up and down the footpath, and swinging his (<font color='blue'><b>carman</b></font>) arms to warm himself.
<p/>'' It's very kind of you to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>carman</b></font>) home,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) said. '' Not at all,'' said Mr. Power. He (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) got up on the car.
<p/>As it drove off he (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) hat to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) gaily. '' We'll make a new man of him (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>),'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Good-night, Mrs. Kernan. '' * * * * * Mrs. Kernan's puzzled eyes watched the car till it was out of sight.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) withdrew them, went into the house and emptied her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) husband's pockets. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) was an active, practical woman of middle age.
<p/>Not long before she (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) had celebrated her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) silver wedding and renewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) intimacy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) husband by waltzing with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to Mr. Power's accompaniment.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) days of courtship, Mr. Kernan had seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) a not ungallant figure: and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) still hurried to the chapel door whenever a wedding was reported and, seeing the bridal pair, recalled with vivid pleasure how she (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) had passed out of the Star of the Sea Church in Sandymount, leaning on the arm of a jovial well-fed man, who was dressed smartly in a frock-coat and lavender trousers and carried a silk hat gracefully balanced upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) other arm.
<p/>After three weeks she (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) had found a wife's life irksome and, later on, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) was beginning to find it unbearable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) had become a mother.
<p/>The part of mother presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) no insuperable difficulties and for twenty-five years she (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) had kept house shrewdly for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) husband.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) two eldest sons were launched. One was in a draper's shop in Glasgow and the other was clerk to a tea-merchant in Belfast.
<p/>They were good sons, wrote regularly and sometimes sent home money. The other children were still at school. Mr. Kernan sent a letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) office next day and remained in bed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) accepted his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) frequent intemperance as part of the climate, healed him (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) dutifully whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) was sick and always tried to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) eat a breakfast.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) had never been violent since the boys had grown up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) would walk to the end of Thomas Street and back again to book even a small order.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) made beef-tea for him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) and scolded him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) roundly. There were worse husbands. Two nights after, his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) friends came to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) brought them up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) bedroom, the air of which was impregnated with a personal odour, and gave them chairs at the fire.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sat propped up in the bed by pillows and the little colour in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) puffy cheeks made them resemble warm cinders.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) apologised to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) guests for the disorder of the room, but at the same time looked at them a little proudly, with a veteran's pride.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>veteran</b></font>) was quite unconscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>veteran</b></font>) was the victim of a plot which his (<font color='blue'><b>veteran</b></font>) friends, Mr. Cunningham, Mr. M'Coy and Mr. Power had disclosed to Mrs. Kernan in the parlour.
<p/>Mr. Kernan's tongue, the occasional stinging pain of which had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) somewhat irritable during the day, became more polite. The idea had been Mr. Power's, but its development was entrusted to Mr. Cunningham.
<p/>Mr. Kernan came of Protestant stock and, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) had been converted to the Catholic faith at the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) marriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) had not been in the pale of the Church for twenty years.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) was fond, moreover, of giving side-thrusts at Catholicism. Mr. Cunningham was the very man for such a case. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) was an elder colleague of Mr. Power.
<p/>People had great sympathy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>), for it was known that he (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) had married an unpresentable woman who was an incurable drunkard.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) own domestic life was not very happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) had set up house for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) six times; and each time she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had pawned the furniture on him (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) blade of human knowledge, natural astuteness particularised by long association with cases in the police courts, had been tempered by brief immersions in the waters of general philosophy.
<p/>Everyone had respect for poor Martin Cunningham. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) was a thoroughly sensible man, influential and intelligent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) was well informed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) friends bowed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) opinions and considered that his (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) face was like Shakespeare's.
<p/>When the plot had been disclosed to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), Mrs. Kernan had said: <div class="bookquote">``I leave it all in your hands, Mr. Cunningham.
<p/>Religion for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) was a habit, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) suspected that a man of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) husband's age would not change greatly before death.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) was tempted to see a curious appropriateness in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) accident and, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) did not wish to seem bloody-minded, would have told the gentlemen that Mr. Kernan's tongue would not suffer by being shortened.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kernan/Kernan</b></font>)</div>After a quarter of a century of married life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) had very few illusions left. However, Mr. Cunningham was a capable man; and religion was religion.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) believed steadily in the Sacred Heart as the most generally useful of all Catholic devotions and approved of the sacraments.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) faith was bounded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) kitchen, but, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) was put to it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) could believe also in the banshee and in the Holy Ghost.
<p/>The scheme might do good and, at least, it could do no harm. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) beliefs were not extravagant. The gentlemen began to talk of the accident.
<p/>A man of seventy had bitten off a piece of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tongue during an epileptic fit and the tongue had filled in again, so that no one could see a trace of the bite.
<p/>Mr. Cunningham said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) had once known a similar case. '' Well, I'm not seventy,'' said the invalid. '' God forbid,'' said Mr. Cunningham.
<p/>'' It doesn't pain you now?'' asked Mr. M'Coy. Mr. M'Coy had been at one time a tenor of some reputation.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) line of life had not been the shortest distance between two points and for short periods he (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) had been driven to live by his (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) wits.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) had been a clerk in the Midland Railway, a canvasser for advertisements for The Irish Times and for The Freeman's Journal, a town traveller for a coal firm on commission, a private inquiry agent, a clerk in the office of the Sub-Sheriff, and he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) had recently become secretary to the City Coroner.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) wife, who had been a soprano, still taught young children to play the piano at low terms. His (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) new office made him (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) professionally interested in Mr. Kernan's case.
<p/>'' Pain? Not much,'' answered Mr. Kernan. '' But it's so sickening. I feel as if I wanted to retch off.''
<p/>'' That's the boose,'' said Mr. Cunningham firmly. '' No,'' said Mr. Kernan. '' I think I caught a cold on the car.
<p/>There's something keeps coming into my throat, phlegm or-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Mucus.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. M'Coy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. M'Coy. '' It keeps coming like from down in my throat; sickening.''
<p/>'' Yes, yes,'' said Mr. M'Coy, <div class="bookquote">``that's the thorax. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. M'Coy</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) looked at Mr. Cunningham and Mr. Power at the same time with an air of challenge.
<p/>Mr. Cunningham nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) head rapidly and Mr. Power said: <div class="bookquote">``Ah, well, all's well that ends well.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'm very much obliged to you, old man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div>said the invalid.
<p/>Mr. Power waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) hand. '' Those other two fellows I was with-- '' '' Who were you with?'' asked Mr. Cunningham.
<p/>'' A chap. I don't know his (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) name. Damn it now, what's his (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) name? Little chap with sandy hair... '' ''
<p/>And who else?'' <div class="bookquote">``Harford. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cunningham. When Mr. Cunningham made that remark, people were silent. It was known that the speaker had secret sources of information.
<p/>Mr. Harford sometimes formed one of a little detachment which left the city shortly after noon on Sunday with the purpose of arriving as soon as possible at some public-house on the outskirts of the city where its members duly qualified themselves as bona fide travellers.
<p/>In this case the monosyllable had a moral intention. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Harford</b></font>) fellow-travellers had never consented to overlook his (<font color='blue'><b>Harford</b></font>) origin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harford</b></font>) had begun life as an obscure financier by lending small sums of money to workmen at usurious interest.
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harford</b></font>) had never embraced more than the Jewish ethical code, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harford</b></font>) fellow-Catholics, whenever they had smarted in person or by proxy under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harford</b></font>) exactions, spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harford</b></font>) bitterly as an Irish Jew and an illiterate, and saw divine disapproval of usury made manifest through the person of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harford</b></font>) idiot son.
<p/>Later on he (<font color='blue'><b>Harford</b></font>) had become the partner of a very fat, short gentleman, Mr. Goldberg, in the Liffey Loan Bank. At other times they remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) good points.
<p/>'' I wonder where did he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) go to,'' said Mr. Kernan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) wished the details of the incident to remain vague.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) wished his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) friends to think there had been some mistake, that Mr. Harford and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harford</b></font>) had missed each other. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harford</b></font>) friends, who knew quite well Mr. Harford's manners in drinking were silent.
<p/>Mr. Power said again: <div class="bookquote">``All's well that ends well. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div>Mr. Kernan changed the subject at once. '' That was a decent young chap, that medical fellow,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) said.
<p/>Only for him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)--'' <div class="bookquote">``O, only for him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Power, <div class="bookquote">``it might have been a case of seven days, without the option of a fine.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div>'' '' Yes, yes,'' said Mr. Kernan, trying to remember. '' I remember now there was a policeman. Decent young fellow, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) seemed.
<p/>How did it happen at all?'' '' It happened that you were peloothered, Tom,'' said Mr. Cunningham gravely. '' True bill,'' said Mr. Kernan, equally gravely.
<p/>'' I suppose you squared the constable, Jack,'' said Mr. M'Coy. Mr. Power did not relish the use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) Christian name.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) was not straight-laced, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) could not forget that Mr. M'Coy had recently made a crusade in search of valises and portmanteaus to enable Mrs. M'Coy to fulfil imaginary engagements in the country.
<p/>More than he (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) resented the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) had been victimised he (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) resented such low playing of the game. He (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) answered the question, therefore, as if Mr. Kernan had asked it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) was keenly conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) citizenship, wished to live with his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) city on terms mutually honourable and resented any affront put upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) by those whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) called country bumpkins.
<p/>The narrative made Mr. Kernan indignant. '' Is this what we pay rates for?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) asked. '' To feed and clothe these ignorant bostooms... and they're nothing else.
<p/>'' Mr. Cunningham laughed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) was a Castle official only during office hours. '' How could they be anything else, Tom?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) assumed a thick, provincial accent and said in a tone of command: <div class="bookquote">``65, catch your cabbage!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Everyone laughed.
<p/>Mr. Cunningham said: <div class="bookquote">``It is supposed--they say, you know--to take place in the depot where they get these thundering big country fellows, omadhauns, you know, to drill.
<p/>Mr. M'Coy, who wanted to enter the conversation by any door, pretended that he (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) had never heard the story. The sergeant makes them stand in a row against the wall and hold up their plates.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) has a bloody big bowl of cabbage before him (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) on the table and a bloody big spoon like a shovel.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) takes up a wad of cabbage on the spoon and pegs it across the room and the poor devils have to try and catch it on their plates: 65, catch your cabbage.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) illustrated the story by grotesque gestures. '' At dinner, you know. '' Everyone laughed again: but Mr. Kernan was somewhat indignant still.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) talked of writing a letter to the papers. '' These yahoos coming up here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``think they can boss the people.
<p/>I needn't tell you, Martin, what kind of men they are. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mr. Cunningham gave a qualified assent. '' It's like everything else in this world,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' You get some bad ones and you get some good ones. '' <div class="bookquote">``O yes, you get some good ones, I admit,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kernan/Kernan</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kernan, satisfied.
<p/>'' It's better to have nothing to say to them,'' said Mr. M'Coy. '' That's my opinion!'' Mrs. Kernan entered the room and, placing a tray on the table, said: <div class="bookquote">``Help yourselves, gentlemen.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) declined it, saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) was ironing downstairs, and, after having exchanged a nod with Mr. Cunningham behind Mr. Power's back, prepared to leave the room.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kernan/Kernan</b></font>)</div>Mr. Power stood up to officiate, offering her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) chair. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) husband called out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``And have you nothing for me, duckie?''
 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, you! The back of my hand to you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kernan/Kernan</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Kernan tartly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) husband called after her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Nothing for poor little hubby!''
 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hubby</b></font>) assumed such a comical face and voice that the distribution of the bottles of stout took place amid general merriment.
<p/>The gentlemen drank from their glasses, set the glasses again on the table and paused. Then Mr. Cunningham turned towards Mr. Power and said casually: <div class="bookquote">``On Thursday night, you said, Jack.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thursday, yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Power. <div class="bookquote">``Righto!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cunningham promptly. '' We can meet in M'Auley's,'' said Mr. M'Coy. '' That'll be the most convenient place.''
<p/>'' But we mustn't be late,'' said Mr. Power earnestly, <div class="bookquote">``because it is sure to be crammed to the doors. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We can meet at half-seven,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. M'Coy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. M'Coy. <div class="bookquote">``Righto! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cunningham. '' Half-seven at M'Auley's be it! '' There was a short silence.
<p/>Mr. Kernan waited to see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) would be taken into his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) friends' confidence. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) asked: <div class="bookquote">``What's in the wind?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, it's nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cunningham. '' It's only a little matter that we're arranging about for Thursday.'' '' The opera, is it?'' said Mr. Kernan.
<p/>'' No, no,'' said Mr. Cunningham in an evasive tone, <div class="bookquote">``it's just a little... spiritual matter. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kernan/Kernan</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kernan.
<p/>There was silence again. Then Mr. Power said, point blank: <div class="bookquote">``To tell you the truth, Tom, we're going to make a retreat.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) uttered the metaphor with a certain homely energy and, encouraged by his (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) own voice, proceeded: <div class="bookquote">``You see, we may as well all admit we're a nice collection of scoundrels, one and all.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Yes, that's it,'' said Mr. Cunningham, <div class="bookquote">``Jack and I and M'Coy here--we're all going to wash the pot. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div>I say, one and all,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) added with gruff charity and turning to Mr. Power.
<p/>'' Own up now!'' <div class="bookquote">``I own up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Power. '' And I own up,'' said Mr. M'Coy. '' So we're going to wash the pot together,'' said Mr. Cunningham.
<p/>A thought seemed to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) turned suddenly to the invalid and said: <div class="bookquote">``D'ye know what, Tom, has just occurred to me?
<p/>You night join in and we'd have a four-handed reel.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good idea,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Power. '' The four of us together.
<p/>The proposal conveyed very little meaning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) mind, but, understanding that some spiritual agencies were about to concern themselves on his (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) behalf, he (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) owed it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) dignity to show a stiff neck.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) took no part in the conversation for a long while, but listened, with an air of calm enmity, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) friends discussed the Jesuits.
<p/>'' Mr. Kernan was silent. '' I haven't such a bad opinion of the Jesuits,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) said, intervening at length. ''
<p/>They're an educated order. I believe they mean well, too. '' '' They're the grandest order in the Church, Tom,'' said Mr. Cunningham, with enthusiasm.
<p/>'' The General of the Jesuits stands next to the Pope. '' '' There's no mistake about it,'' said Mr. M'Coy, <div class="bookquote">``if you want a thing well done and
<p/>no flies about, you go to a Jesuit. They're the boyos have influence. I'll tell you a case in point... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. M'Coy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Jesuits are a fine body of men,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Power.
<p/>Every other order of the Church had to be reformed at some time or other but the Jesuit Order was never once reformed.
<p/>'' It's a curious thing,'' said Mr. Cunningham, <div class="bookquote">``about the Jesuit Order. It never fell away.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is that so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. M'Coy</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. M'Coy.
<p/>'' That's a fact,'' said Mr. Cunningham. '' That's history.'' <div class="bookquote">``Look at their church, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Power. '' Look at the congregation they have.''
<p/>'' The Jesuits cater for the upper classes,'' said Mr. M'Coy. '' Of course,'' said Mr. Power. '' Yes,'' said Mr. Kernan.
<p/>'' That's why I have a feeling for them. It's some of those secular priests, ignorant, bumptious--'' '' They're all good men,'' said Mr. Cunningham, <div class="bookquote">``each in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) own way.
<p/>The Irish priesthood is honoured all the world over.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Power. '' Not like some of the other priesthoods on the continent,'' said Mr. M'Coy, <div class="bookquote">``unworthy of the name.
<p/>I haven't been in the world all this time and seen most sides of it without being a judge of character.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. M'Coy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you're right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kernan/Kernan</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kernan, relenting. '' Of course I'm right,'' said Mr. Cunningham. '' '' The gentlemen drank again, one following another's example.
<p/>Mr. Kernan seemed to be weighing something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) was impressed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) had a high opinion of Mr. Cunningham as a judge of character and as a reader of faces.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) asked for particulars. '' O, it's just a retreat, you know,'' said Mr. Cunningham. '' Father Purdon is giving it.
<p/>It's for business men, you know.'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) won't be too hard on us, Tom,'' said Mr. Power persuasively. '' Father Purdon?
<p/>Father Purdon? '' said the invalid. '' O, you must know him (<font color='blue'><b>Purdon</b></font>), Tom,'' said Mr. Cunningham stoutly. '' Fine, jolly fellow!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>)'s a man of the world like ourselves.'' '' Ah, ... yes. I think I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>). Rather red face; tall.
<p/>'' '' That's the man.'' '' And tell me, Martin.... Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) a good preacher?'' <div class="bookquote">``Munno.... It's not exactly a sermon, you know.
<p/>It's just kind of a friendly talk, you know, in a common-sense way. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kernan/Kernan</b></font>)</div>Mr. Kernan deliberated. Mr. M'Coy said: <div class="bookquote">``Father Tom Burke, that was the boy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. M'Coy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, Father Tom Burke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cunningham, <div class="bookquote">``that was a born orator.

(<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did I ever hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the invalid, nettled.
<p/>'' Rather! I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)...'' '' And yet they say he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wasn't much of a theologian,'' said Mr Cunningham. '' Is that so?'' said Mr. M'Coy.
<p/>'' O, of course, nothing wrong, you know. Only sometimes, they say, he (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) didn't preach what was quite orthodox.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah!... he (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) was a splendid man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. M'Coy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. M'Coy.
<p/>'' I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) once,'' Mr. Kernan continued. '' I forget the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) discourse now. Crofton and I were in the back of the... pit,
<p/>you know... the-- '' <div class="bookquote">``The body,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cunningham. '' Yes, in the back near the door. I forget now what....
<p/>O yes, it was on the Pope, the late Pope. I remember it well. Upon my word it was magnificent, the style of the oratory.
<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) voice! God! hadn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) a voice! The Prisoner of the Vatican, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>Pope</b></font>). I remember Crofton saying to me when we came out--
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``But he (<font color='blue'><b>Crofton</b></font>)'s an Orangeman, Crofton, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Crofton</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Power. '' `Course he (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) is,'' said Mr. Kernan, <div class="bookquote">``and a damned decent Orangeman too.
<p/>We went into Butler's in Moore Street--faith, I was genuinely moved, tell you the God's truth--and I remember well his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) very words. '
<p/>Kernan,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) said, `we worship at different altars, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) said, but our belief is the same.' Struck me as very well put.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kernan/Kernan</b></font>)</div>'' There's a good deal in that,'' said Mr. Power. '' There used always to be crowds of Protestants in the chapel where Father Tom was preaching.''
<p/>'' There's not much difference between us,'' said Mr. M'Coy. '' We both believe in-- '' He (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) hesitated for a moment. ''... in the Redeemer.
<p/>Only they don't believe in the Pope and in the mother of God.'' '' But, of course,'' said Mr. Cunningham quietly and effectively, <div class="bookquote">``our religion is the religion, the old, original faith.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not a doubt of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kernan/Kernan</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kernan warmly. Mrs. Kernan came to the door of the bedroom and announced: <div class="bookquote">``Here's a visitor for you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Kernan/Kernan</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Who is it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Fogarty. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O, come in! come in!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A pale, oval face came forward into the light.
<p/>The arch of its fair trailing moustache was repeated in the fair eyebrows looped above pleasantly astonished eyes. Mr. Fogarty was a modest grocer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fogarty</b></font>) had failed in business in a licensed house in the city because his (<font color='blue'><b>Fogarty</b></font>) financial condition had constrained him (<font color='blue'><b>Fogarty</b></font>) to tie himself to second-class distillers and brewers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fogarty</b></font>) had opened a small shop on Glasnevin Road where, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fogarty</b></font>) flattered himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Fogarty</b></font>) manners would ingratiate him (<font color='blue'><b>Fogarty</b></font>) with the housewives of the district.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fogarty</b></font>) bore himself with a certain grace, complimented little children and spoke with a neat enunciation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fogarty</b></font>) was not without culture.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fogarty</b></font>) inquired politely for Mr. Kernan, placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) gift on the table and sat down with the company on equal terms.
<p/>Mr. Kernan appreciated the gift all the more since he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) was aware that there was a small account for groceries unsettled between him (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) and Mr. Fogarty.
<p/>Mr. Fogarty brought a gift with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fogarty</b></font>), a half-pint of special whisky. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fogarty</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't doubt you, old man. Open that, Jack, will you?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Mr. Power again officiated. Glasses were rinsed and five small measures of whisky were poured out. This new influence enlivened the conversation.
<p/>Mr. Fogarty, sitting on a small area of the chair, was specially interested. '' Pope Leo XIII,'' said Mr. Cunningham, <div class="bookquote">``was one of the lights of the age.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) great idea, you know, was the union of the Latin and Greek Churches. That was the aim of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) life.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I often heard he (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) was one of the most intellectual men in Europe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Power. '' I mean, apart from his (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) being Pope.''
<p/>'' So he (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) was,'' said Mr. Cunningham, <div class="bookquote">``if not the most so. His (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) motto, you know, as Pope, was Lux upon Lux--Light upon Light.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fogarty/Fogarty</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fogarty eagerly. '' I think you're wrong there. It was Lux in Tenebris , I think--Light in Darkness.''
<p/>And Pius IX his (<font color='blue'><b>Fogarty</b></font>) predecessor's motto was Crux upon Crux--that is, Cross upon Cross--to show the difference between their two pontificates.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. M'Coy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. M'Coy, <div class="bookquote">``Tenebrae. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. M'Coy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Allow me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cunningham positively, <div class="bookquote">``it was Lux upon Lux. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div>The inference was allowed.
<p/>Mr. Cunningham continued. '' Pope Leo, you know, was a great scholar and a poet. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Leo</b></font>) had a strong face,'' said Mr. Kernan.
<p/>Mr. M'Coy tasted his (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) whisky contentedly and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) head with a double intention, saying: <div class="bookquote">``That's no joke, I can tell you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. M'Coy</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes,'' said Mr. Cunningham. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) wrote Latin poetry.'' <div class="bookquote">``Is that so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fogarty/Fogarty</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fogarty. <div class="bookquote">``We didn't learn that, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Power, following Mr. M'Coy's example, <div class="bookquote">``when we went to the penny-a-week school.
<p/>There was many a good man went to the penny-a-week school with a sod of turf under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) oxter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. M'Coy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kernan sententiously.
<p/>'' '' '' The old system was the best: plain honest education. None of your modern trumpery... '' <div class="bookquote">``Quite right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Power.
<p/>I remember reading,'' said Mr. Cunningham, <div class="bookquote">``that one of Pope Leo's poems was on the invention of the photograph--in Latin, of course.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div>No superfluities,'' said Mr. Fogarty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fogarty</b></font>) enunciated the word and then drank gravely. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``On the photograph!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kernan/Kernan</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mr. Kernan.
<p/>'' Yes,'' said Mr. Cunningham. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) also drank from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) glass. '' Well, you know,'' said Mr. M'Coy, <div class="bookquote">``isn't the photograph wonderful when you come to think of it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. M'Coy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Power, <div class="bookquote">``great minds can see things. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div>'' As the poet says: Great minds are very near to madness,'' said Mr. Fogarty.
<p/>Mr. Kernan seemed to be troubled in mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) made an effort to recall the Protestant theology on some thorny points and in the end addressed Mr. Cunningham.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me, Martin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Weren't some of the popes--of course, not our present man, or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) predecessor, but some of the old popes--not exactly...
<p/>you know... up to the knocker? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a silence. Mr. Cunningham said <div class="bookquote">``O, of course, there were some bad lots...
<p/>Not one of them, not the biggest drunkard, not the most... out-and-out ruffian, not one of them ever preached ex cathedra a word of false doctrine.
<p/>But the astonishing thing is this. Now isn't that an astonishing thing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div>'' That is,'' said Mr. Kernan. '' Yes, because when the Pope speaks ex cathedra,'' Mr. Fogarty explained, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Fogarty</b></font>) is infallible.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fogarty/Fogarty</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes,'' said Mr. Cunningham. '' O, I know about the infallibility of the Pope. I remember I was younger then....
<p/>Or was it that--? '' Mr. Fogarty interrupted. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fogarty</b></font>) took up the bottle and helped the others to a little more.
<p/>Mr. M'Coy, seeing that there was not enough to go round, pleaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) had not finished his (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) first measure. The others accepted under protest.
<p/>The light music of whisky falling into glasses made an agreeable interlude. '' What's that you were saying, Tom?'' asked Mr. M'Coy.
<p/>'' Papal infallibility,'' said Mr. Cunningham, <div class="bookquote">``that was the greatest scene in the whole history of the Church. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How was that, Martin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Power.
<p/>In the sacred college, you know, of cardinals and archbishops and bishops there were two men who held out against it while the others were all for it.
<p/>Mr. Cunningham held up two thick fingers. '' The whole conclave except these two was unanimous. No! They wouldn't have it!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. M'Coy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. M'Coy. '' And they were a German cardinal by the name of Dolling... or Dowling... or-- '' ''
<p/>Dowling was no German, and that's a sure five,'' said Mr. Power, laughing. '' Well, this great German cardinal, whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) name was, was one; and the other was John MacHale.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kernan/Kernan</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Kernan. <div class="bookquote">``Is it John of Tuam?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure of that now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fogarty/Fogarty</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Fogarty dubiously. ''
<p/>I thought it was some Italian or American.'' <div class="bookquote">``John of Tuam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Cunningham, <div class="bookquote">``was the man. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) drank and the other gentlemen followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) lead.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) resumed: <div class="bookquote">``There they were at it, all the cardinals and bishops and archbishops from all the ends of the earth and these two fighting dog and devil until at last the Pope himself stood up and declared infallibility a dogma of the Church ex cathedra.
<p/>On the very moment John MacHale, who had been arguing and arguing against it, stood up and shouted out with the voice of a lion: `Credo!'''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fogarty/Fogarty</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fogarty. <div class="bookquote">``Credo! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cunningham. '' That showed the faith he (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) had. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) submitted the moment the Pope spoke.''
<p/>'' And what about Dowling? '' asked Mr. M'Coy. '' The German cardinal wouldn't submit. He (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) left the church. '' Mr. Cunningham's words had built up the vast image of the church in the minds of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) hearers.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) deep, raucous voice had thrilled them as it uttered the word of belief and submission. When Mrs. Kernan came into the room, drying her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) hands she (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) came into a solemn company.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) did not disturb the silence, but leaned over the rail at the foot of the bed. '' I once saw John MacHale,'' said Mr. Kernan, <div class="bookquote">``and I'll never forget it as long as I live.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kernan/Kernan</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) turned towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) wife to be confirmed. '' I often told you that?'' Mrs. Kernan nodded. '' It was at the unveiling of Sir John Gray's statue.
<p/>Edmund Dwyer Gray was speaking, blathering away, and here was this old fellow, crabbed-looking old chap, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) from under his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) bushy eyebrows.
<p/>'' Mr. Kernan knitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) brows and, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) head like an angry bull, glared at his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) wife. '' God!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) exclaimed, resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) natural face, <div class="bookquote">``I never saw such an eye in a man's head.
<p/>It was as much as to say: I have you properly taped, my lad. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had an eye like a hawk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Power turned to Mrs. Kernan and said with abrupt joviality: ``Well, Mrs. Kernan, we're going to make your man here a good holy pious and God-fearing Roman Catholic.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``None of the Grays was any good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Power</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Power. There was a pause again. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) swept his (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) arm round the company inclusively.
<p/>'' We're all going to make a retreat together and confess our sins--and God knows we want it badly. '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kernan/Kernan</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kernan, smiling a little nervously.
<p/>Mrs. Kernan thought it would be wiser to conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) satisfaction. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I pity the poor priest that has to listen to your tale.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mr. Kernan's expression changed. '' If he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) doesn't like it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) said bluntly, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) can... do the other thing. I'll just tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) my little tale of woe.
<p/>I'm not such a bad fellow-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mr. Cunningham intervened promptly. '' We'll all renounce the devil,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``together, not forgetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) works and pomps.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Get behind me, Satan!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Fogarty/Fogarty</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Fogarty, laughing and looking at the others. Mr. Power said nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Power</b></font>) felt completely out-generalled.
<p/>All we have to do,'' said Mr. Cunningham, <div class="bookquote">``is to stand up with lighted candles in our hands and renew our baptismal vows.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div><p/>But a pleased expression flickered across his (<font color='blue'><b>Cunningham</b></font>) face. '' <div class="bookquote">``O, don't forget the candle, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. M'Coy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. M'Coy, <div class="bookquote">``whatever you do.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. M'Coy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kernan/Kernan</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Kernan. '' Must I have a candle?'' <div class="bookquote">``O yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Cunningham</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Cunningham. '' No, damn it all,'' said Mr. Kernan sensibly, <div class="bookquote">``I draw the line there.
<p/>I'll do the job right enough. I'll do the retreat business and confession, and... all that business. But... no candles! No, damn it all, I bar the candles!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Kernan/Kernan</b></font>)</div><p/>I bar the candles,'' said Mr. Kernan, conscious of having created an effect on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) audience and continuing to shake his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) head to and fro.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) head with farcical gravity. <div class="bookquote">``Listen to that!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) wife. '' '' I bar the magic-lantern business. ''
<p/>Everyone laughed heartily. '' There's a nice Catholic for you!'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) wife. '' No candles!'' repeated Mr. Kernan obdurately. ''
<p/>The transept of the Jesuit Church in Gardiner Street was almost full; and still at every moment gentlemen entered from the side door and, directed by the lay-brother, walked on tiptoe along the aisles until they found seating accommodation.
<p/>The light of the lamps of the church fell upon an assembly of black clothes and white collars, relieved here and there by tweeds, on dark mottled pillars of green marble and on lugubrious canvases.
<p/>That's off!'' The gentlemen were all well dressed and orderly. The gentlemen sat in the benches, having hitched their trousers slightly above their knees and laid their hats in security.
<p/>They sat well back and gazed formally at the distant speck of red light which was suspended before the high altar.
<p/>In one of the benches near the pulpit sat Mr. Cunningham and Mr. Kernan. In the bench behind sat Mr. M'Coy alone: and in the bench behind him (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) sat Mr. Power and Mr. Fogarty.
<p/>Mr. M'Coy had tried unsuccessfully to find a place in the bench with the others, and, when the party had settled down in the form of a quincunx, he (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) had tried unsuccessfully to make comic remarks.
<p/>As these had not been well received, he (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) had desisted. Even he (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) was sensible of the decorous atmosphere and even he (<font color='blue'><b>M'Coy</b></font>) began to respond to the religious stimulus.
<p/>In a whisper, Mr. Cunningham drew Mr. Kernan's attention to Mr. Harford, the moneylender, who sat some distance off, and to Mr. Fanning, the registration agent and mayor maker of the city, who was sitting immediately under the pulpit beside one of the newly elected councillors of the ward.
<p/>To the right sat old Michael Grimes, the owner of three pawnbroker's shops, and Dan Hogan's nephew, who was up for the job in the Town Clerk's office.
<p/>Farther in front sat Mr. Hendrick, the chief reporter of The Freeman's Journal, and poor O'Carroll, an old friend of Mr. Kernan's, who had been at one time a considerable commercial figure.
<p/>Gradually, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) recognised familiar faces, Mr. Kernan began to feel more at home. His (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) hat, which had been rehabilitated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) wife, rested upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) knees.
<p/>Once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) pulled down his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) cuffs with one hand while he (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) held the brim of his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) hat lightly, but firmly, with the other hand.
<p/>A powerful-looking figure, the upper part of which was draped with a white surplice, was observed to be struggling into the pulpit.
<p/>The priest's figure now stood upright in the pulpit, two-thirds of its bulk, crowned by a massive red face, appearing above the balustrade.
<p/>Simultaneously the congregation unsettled, produced handkerchiefs and knelt upon them with care. Mr. Kernan followed the general example. Father Purdon knelt down, turned towards the red speck of light and, covering his (<font color='blue'><b>Purdon</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Purdon</b></font>) hands, prayed.
<p/>After an interval, he (<font color='blue'><b>Purdon</b></font>) uncovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Purdon</b></font>) face and rose. The congregation rose also and settled again on its benches. Mr. Kernan restored his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) hat to its original position on his (<font color='blue'><b>Kernan</b></font>) knee and presented an attentive face to the preacher.
<p/>The preacher turned back each wide sleeve of his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) surplice with an elaborate large gesture and slowly surveyed the array of faces.
<p/>Wherefore make unto yourselves friends out of the mammon of iniquity so that when you die they may receive you into everlasting dwellings.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``For the children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Father Purdon developed the text with resonant assurance.
<p/>It was a text which might seem to the casual observer at variance with the lofty morality elsewhere preached by Jesus Christ.
<p/>But, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) hearers, the text had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) specially adapted for the guidance of those whose lot it was to lead the life of the world and who yet wished to lead that life not in the manner of worldlings.
<p/>It was one of the most difficult texts in all the Scriptures, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) said, to interpret properly. It was a text for business men and professional men.
<p/>Jesus Christ, with His (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) divine understanding of every cranny of our human nature, understood that all men were not called to the religious life, that by far the vast majority were forced to live in the world, and, to a certain extent, for the world: and in this sentence He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) designed to give them a word of counsel, setting before them as exemplars in the religious life those very worshippers of Mammon who were of all men the least solicitous in matters religious.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) hearers that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was there that evening for no terrifying, no extravagant purpose; but as a man of the world speaking to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fellow-men.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might use the metaphor, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was their spiritual accountant; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wished each and every one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hearers to open his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) books, the books of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spiritual life, and see if they tallied accurately with conscience.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to speak to business men and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would speak to them in a businesslike way. Jesus Christ was not a hard taskmaster.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) understood our little failings, understood the weakness of our poor fallen nature, understood the temptations of this life. We might have had, we all had from time to time,
<p/>our temptations: we might have, we all had, our failings. But one thing only, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) would ask of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) hearers.
<p/>And that was: to be straight and manly with God. If their accounts tallied in every point to say: ``Well, I have verified my accounts.
<p/>But if, as might happen, there were some discrepancies, to admit the truth, to be frank and say like a man: <div class="bookquote">``Well, I have looked into my accounts.
<p/>I find all well. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>I find this wrong and this wrong. But, with God's grace, I will rectify this and this.
<p/>Hardly had she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) brought one gentleman into the little pantry behind the office on the ground floor and helped him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) off with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) overcoat than the wheezy hall-door bell clanged again
<p/>I will set right my accounts. '' THE DEAD LILY, the caretaker's daughter, was literally run off her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) feet. and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had to scamper along the bare hallway to let in another guest.
<p/>It was well for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had not to attend to the ladies also. But Miss Kate and Miss Julia had thought of that and had converted the bathroom upstairs into a ladies' dressing-room.
<p/>Miss Kate and Miss Julia were there, gossiping and laughing and fussing, walking after each other to the head of the stairs, peering down over the banisters and calling down to Lily to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) who had come.
<p/>Everybody who knew them came to it, members of the family, old friends of the family, the members of Julia's choir, any of Kate's pupils that were grown up enough, and even some of Mary Jane's pupils too.
<p/>For years and years it had gone off in splendid style, as long as anyone could remember; ever since Kate and Julia, after the death of their brother Pat, had left the house in Stoney Batter and taken Mary Jane, their only niece, to live with them in the dark, gaunt house on Usher's Island, the upper part of which they had rented from Mr. Fulham, the corn-factor on the ground floor.
<p/>It was always a great affair, the Misses Morkan's annual dance. Never once had it fallen flat. That was a good thirty years ago if it was a day.
<p/>Mary Jane, who was then a little girl in short clothes, was now the main prop of the household, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had the organ in Haddington Road.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had been through the Academy and gave a pupils' concert every year in the upper room of the Antient Concert Rooms.
<p/>Many of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) pupils belonged to the better-class families on the Kingstown and Dalkey line. Old as they were, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) aunts also did their share.
<p/>Julia, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) was quite grey, was still the leading soprano in Adam and Eve's, and Kate, being too feeble to go about much, gave music lessons to beginners on the old square piano in the back room.
<p/>Though their life was modest, they believed in eating well; the best of everything: diamond-bone sirloins, three-shilling tea and the best bottled stout.
<p/>Lily, the caretaker's daughter, did housemaid's work for them. But Lily seldom made a mistake in the orders, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) got on well with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) three mistresses.
<p/>They were fussy, that was all. But the only thing they would not stand was back answers. Of course, they had good reason to be fussy on such a night.
<p/>And then it was long after ten o'clock and yet there was no sign of Gabriel and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) wife. Besides they were dreadfully afraid that Freddy Malins might turn up screwed.
<p/>They would not wish for worlds that any of Mary Jane's pupils should see him (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) under the influence; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) was like that it was sometimes very hard to manage him (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>).
<p/>Freddy Malins always came late, but they wondered what could be keeping Gabriel: and that was what brought them every two minutes to the banisters to ask Lily had Gabriel or Freddy come.
<p/>O, Mr. Conroy,'' said Lily to Gabriel when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) opened the door for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Miss Kate and Miss Julia thought you were never coming.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Good-night, Mrs. Conroy.'' <div class="bookquote">``I'll engage they did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel, ``but they forget that my wife here takes three mortal hours to dress herself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) stood on the mat, scraping the snow from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) goloshes, while Lily led his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) wife to the foot of the stairs and called out: <div class="bookquote">``Miss Kate, here's Mrs. Conroy.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>'' Kate and Julia came toddling down the dark stairs at once. Both of them kissed Gabriel's wife, said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must be perished alive, and asked was Gabriel with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).
<p/>'' Here I am as right as the mail, Aunt Kate! Go on up. I'll follow,'' called out Gabriel from the dark.
<p/>A light fringe of snow lay like a cape on the shoulders of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) overcoat and like toecaps on the toes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) goloshes; and, as the buttons of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) overcoat slipped with a squeaking noise through the snow-stiffened frieze, a cold, fragrant air from out-of-doors escaped from crevices and folds.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) continued scraping his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) feet vigorously while the three women went upstairs, laughing, to the ladies' dressing-room. '' Is it snowing again, Mr. Conroy?'' asked Lily.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had preceded him (<font color='blue'><b>Conroy</b></font>) into the pantry to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Conroy</b></font>) off with his (<font color='blue'><b>Conroy</b></font>) overcoat. Gabriel smiled at the three syllables she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had given his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) surname and glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was a slim, growing girl, pale in complexion and with hay-coloured hair. The gas in the pantry made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) look still paler.
<p/>Gabriel had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) was a child and used to sit on the lowest step nursing a rag doll.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) looked up at the pantry ceiling, which was shaking with the stamping and shuffling of feet on the floor above, listened for a moment to the piano and then glanced at the girl, who was folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) overcoat carefully at the end of a shelf.
<p/>'' Yes, Lily,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``and I think we're in for a night of it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tell me. Lily,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said in a friendly tone, ``do you still go to school?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel gaily, ``I suppose we'll be going to your wedding one of these fine days with your young man, eh?
<p/>The girl glanced back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulder and said with great bitterness: <div class="bookquote">``The men that is now is only all palaver and what they can get out of you.
<p/>Gabriel coloured, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had made a mistake and, without looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), kicked off his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) goloshes and flicked actively with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) muffler at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) patent-leather shoes.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O no, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered. '' I'm done schooling this year and more.'' '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was a stout, tallish young man.
<p/>The high colour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) cheeks pushed upwards even to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) forehead, where it scattered itself in a few formless patches of pale red; and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hairless face there scintillated restlessly the polished lenses and the bright gilt rims of the glasses which screened his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) delicate and restless eyes.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) glossy black hair was parted in the middle and brushed in a long curve behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) ears where it curled slightly beneath the groove left by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hat.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had flicked lustre into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) shoes he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) stood up and pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) waistcoat down more tightly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) plump body.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) took a coin rapidly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) pocket. '' O Lily,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said, thrusting it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) hands, <div class="bookquote">``it's Christmastime, isn't it?
<p/>Just... here's a little... ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) walked rapidly towards the door. '' O no, sir! '' cried the girl, following him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>).
<p/>'' Really, sir, I wouldn't take it.'' <div class="bookquote">``Christmas-time! Christmas-time! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel, almost trotting to the stairs and waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in deprecation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) waited outside the drawing-room door until the waltz should finish, listening to the skirts that swept against it and to the shuffling of feet.
<p/>The girl, seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had gained the stairs, called out after him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Well, thank you, sir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was still discomposed by the girl's bitter and sudden retort.
<p/>It had cast a gloom over him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) tried to dispel by arranging his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) cuffs and the bows of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) tie.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) then took from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) waistcoat pocket a little paper and glanced at the headings he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had made for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) speech.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was undecided about the lines from Robert Browning, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) feared they would be above the heads of his (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) hearers.
<p/>The indelicate clacking of the men's heels and the shuffling of their soles reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) that their grade of culture differed from his (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>).
<p/>Some quotation that they would recognise from Shakespeare or from the Melodies would be better. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) would only make himself ridiculous by quoting poetry to them which they could not understand.
<p/>They would think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) was airing his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) superior education. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) would fail with them just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) had failed with the girl in the pantry.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) had taken up a wrong tone. His (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) whole speech was a mistake from first to last, an utter failure. Just then his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) aunts and his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) wife came out of the ladies' dressing-room.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hair, drawn low over the tops of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ears, was grey; and grey also, with darker shadows, was her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) large flaccid face.
<p/>Though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was stout in build and stood erect, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) slow eyes and parted lips gave her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the appearance of a woman who did not know where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was or where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was going.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) aunts were two small, plainly dressed old women. Aunt Julia was an inch or so the taller. Aunt Kate was more vivacious.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) face, healthier than her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) sister's, was all puckers and creases, like a shrivelled red apple, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hair, braided in the same old-fashioned way, had not lost its ripe nut colour.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) was their favourite nephew, the son of their dead elder sister, Ellen, who had married T. J. Conroy of the Port and Docks.
<p/>They both kissed Gabriel frankly. '' Gretta tells me you're not going to take a cab back to Monkstown tonight, Gabriel,'' said Aunt Kate.
<p/>'' No,'' said Gabriel, turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) wife, <div class="bookquote">``we had quite enough of that last year, hadn't we? Don't you remember, Aunt Kate, what a cold Gretta got out of it?
<p/>Cab windows rattling all the way, and the east wind blowing in after we passed Merrion. Very jolly it was. Gretta caught a dreadful cold.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>Aunt Kate frowned severely and nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) head at every word. '' Quite right, Gabriel, quite right,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said. ''
<p/>You can't be too careful.'' '' But as for Gretta there,'' said Gabriel, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>)'d walk home in the snow if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) were let.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)'s really an awful bother, what with green shades for Tom's eyes at night and making him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) do the dumb-bells, and forcing Eva to eat the stirabout.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Conroy laughed. '' Don't mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), Aunt Kate,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said. '' The poor child! And she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) simply hates the sight of it!...
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) broke out into a peal of laughter and glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) husband, whose admiring and happy eyes had been wandering from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) dress to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) face and hair.
<p/>O, but you'll never guess what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) makes me wear now!'' The two aunts laughed heartily, too, for Gabriel's solicitude was a standing joke with them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Goloshes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Conroy</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Conroy. '' That's the latest. Whenever it's wet underfoot I must put on my galoshes. Tonight even, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) wanted me to put them on, but I wouldn't.
<p/>Gabriel laughed nervously and patted his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) tie reassuringly, while Aunt Kate nearly doubled herself, so heartily did she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) enjoy the joke.
<p/>The next thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)'ll buy me will be a diving suit. '' The smile soon faded from Aunt Julia's face and her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) mirthless eyes were directed towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) nephew's face.
<p/>After a pause she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) asked: <div class="bookquote">``And what are goloshes, Gabriel?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Goloshes, Julia!''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>exclaimed her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) sister <div class="bookquote">``Goodness me, don't you know what goloshes are?
<p/>You wear them over your... over your boots, Gretta, isn't it?''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>'' Yes,'' said Mrs. Conroy. '' Guttapercha things. We both have a pair now.
<p/>Gabriel knitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) brows and said, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) were slightly angered: <div class="bookquote">``It's nothing very wonderful, but Gretta thinks it very funny because she (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) says the word reminds her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) of Christy Minstrels.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Gabriel says everyone wears them on the Continent.'' <div class="bookquote">``O, on the Continent,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Julia</b></font>)</div>murmured Aunt Julia, nodding her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) head slowly. '' But tell me, Gabriel,'' said Aunt Kate, with brisk tact.
<p/>'' Of course, you've seen about the room. Gretta was saying...'' <div class="bookquote">``O, the room is all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gretta</b></font>)</div>replied Gabriel. '' I've taken one in the Gresham.''
<p/>'' To be sure,'' said Aunt Kate, <div class="bookquote">``by far the best thing to do. And the children, Gretta, you're not anxious about them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Miss Kate</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, for one night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Conroy</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Conroy. '' Besides, Bessie will look after them. '' '' To be sure,'' said Aunt Kate again.
<p/>'' What a comfort it is to have a girl like that, one you can depend on! There's that Lily, I'm sure I don't know what has come over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) lately.
<p/>Gabriel was about to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) aunt some questions on this point, but she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) broke off suddenly to gaze after her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) sister, who had wandered down the stairs and was craning her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) neck over the banisters.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)'s not the girl she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was at all. '' '' Now, I ask you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said almost testily, <div class="bookquote">``where is Julia going?
<p/>Julia! Julia! Where are you going? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Julia, who had gone half way down one flight, came back and announced blandly: <div class="bookquote">``Here's Freddy.
<p/>At the same moment a clapping of hands and a final flourish of the pianist told that the waltz had ended.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Julia/Miss Julia</b></font>)</div>The drawing-room door was opened from within and some couples came out. Aunt Kate drew Gabriel aside hurriedly and whispered into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) ear:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Slip down, Gabriel, like a good fellow and see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)'s all right, and don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) up if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)'s screwed.
<p/>I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)'s screwed. I'm sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) is. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>Gabriel went to the stairs and listened over the banisters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) could hear two persons talking in the pantry.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) recognised Freddy Malins' laugh. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) went down the stairs noisily. '' It's such a relief,'' said Aunt Kate to Mrs. Conroy, ``that Gabriel is here.
<p/>I always feel easier in my mind when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)'s here.... Julia, there's Miss Daly and Miss Power will take some refreshment.
<p/>A tall wizen-faced man, with a stiff grizzled moustache and swarthy skin, who was passing out with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) partner, said: <div class="bookquote">``And may we have some refreshment, too, Miss Morkan?''
 (<font color='red'><b>partner</b></font>)</div><p/>Thanks for your beautiful waltz, Miss Daly. It made lovely time. '' <div class="bookquote">``Julia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Kate summarily, <div class="bookquote">``and here's Mr. Browne and Miss Furlong.
<p/>I'm the man for the ladies,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Miss Kate</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Browne, pursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) lips until his (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) moustache bristled and smiling in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) wrinkles.
<p/>Take them in, Julia, with Miss Daly and Miss Power. '' '' '' You know, Miss Morkan, the reason they are so fond of me is--
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) did not finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) sentence, but, seeing that Aunt Kate was out of earshot, at once led the three young ladies into the back room.
<p/>The middle of the room was occupied by two square tables placed end to end, and on these Aunt Julia and the caretaker were straightening and smoothing a large cloth.
<p/>On the sideboard were arrayed dishes and plates, and glasses and bundles of knives and forks and spoons. The top of the closed square piano served also as a sideboard for viands and sweets.
<p/>At a smaller sideboard in one corner two young men were standing, drinking hop-bitters. Mr. Browne led his (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) charges thither and invited them all, in jest, to some ladies' punch, hot, strong and sweet.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) asked one of the young men to move aside, and, taking hold of the decanter, filled out for himself a goodly measure of whisky.
<p/>As they said they never took anything strong, he (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) opened three bottles of lemonade for them. The young men eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) respectfully while he (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) took a trial sip.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) wizened face broke into a broader smile, and the three young ladies laughed in musical echo to his (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) pleasantry, swaying their bodies to and fro, with nervous jerks of their shoulders.
<p/>'' God help me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``it's the doctor's orders. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The boldest said: ``O, now, Mr. Browne, I'm sure the doctor never ordered anything of the kind.
<p/>Mr. Browne took another sip of his (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) whisky and said, with sidling mimicry: <div class="bookquote">``Well, you see, I'm like the famous Mrs. Cassidy, who is reported to have said: `Now, Mary Grimes, if I don't take it, make me take it, for I feel I want it.'
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) hot face had leaned forward a little too confidentially and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) had assumed a very low Dublin accent so that the young ladies, with one instinct, received his (<font color='blue'><b>Grimes</b></font>) speech in silence.
<p/>Miss Furlong, who was one of Mary Jane's pupils, asked Miss Daly what was the name of the pretty waltz she (<font color='blue'><b>Daly</b></font>) had played; and Mr. Browne, seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) was ignored, turned promptly to the two young men who were more appreciative.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Browne/Browne</b></font>)</div>'' A red-faced young woman, dressed in pansy, came into the room, excitedly clapping her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands and crying: <div class="bookquote">``Quadrilles! Quadrilles!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>pansy</b></font>)</div>Close on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heels came Aunt Kate, crying: <div class="bookquote">``Two gentlemen and three ladies, Mary Jane!''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Miss Kate</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O, here's Mr. Bergin and Mr. Kerrigan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary Jane/Mary</b></font>)</div>said Mary Jane.
<p/>'' Mr. Kerrigan, will you take Miss Power? Miss Furlong, may I get you a partner, Mr. Bergin. O, that'll just do now.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Three ladies, Mary Jane,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Kate. The two young gentlemen asked the ladies if they might have the pleasure, and Mary Jane turned to Miss Daly.
<p/>O, Miss Daly, you're really awfully good, after playing for the last two dances, but really we're so short of ladies tonight.
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't mind in the least, Miss Morkan.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' But I've a nice partner for you, Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, the tenor.
<p/>As the piano had twice begun the prelude to the first figure Mary Jane led her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) recruits quickly from the room.
<p/>I'll get him (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) to sing later on. All Dublin is raving about him (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``Lovely voice, lovely voice!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Kate. They had hardly gone when Aunt Julia wandered slowly into the room, looking behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) at something.
<p/>Julia, who was carrying in a column of table-napkins, turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) sister and said, simply, as if the question had surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``It's only Freddy, Kate, and Gabriel with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>What is the matter, Julia?'' asked Aunt Kate anxiously. '' Who is it? '' '' In fact right behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) Gabriel could be seen piloting Freddy Malins across the landing.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) face was fleshy and pallid, touched with colour only at the thick hanging lobes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) ears and at the wide wings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) nose.
<p/>The latter, a young man of about forty, was of Gabriel's size and build, with very round shoulders. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had coarse features, a blunt nose, a convex and receding brow, tumid and protruded lips.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was laughing heartily in a high key at a story which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had been telling Gabriel on the stairs and at the same time rubbing the knuckles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) left fist backwards and forwards into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) left eye.
<p/>Freddy Malins bade the Misses Morkan good-evening in what seemed an offhand fashion by reason of the habitual catch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) voice
<p/>and then, seeing that Mr. Browne was grinning at him (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) from the sideboard, crossed the room on rather shaky legs and began to repeat in an undertone the story he (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) had just told to Gabriel.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) heavy-lidded eyes and the disorder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) scanty hair made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) look sleepy. '' Good-evening, Freddy,'' said Aunt Julia. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>)'s not so bad, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>)?'' said Aunt Kate to Gabriel. Gabriel's brows were dark but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) raised them quickly and answered: <div class="bookquote">``O, no, hardly noticeable.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) a terrible fellow! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) said. '' And his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) poor mother made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) take the pledge on New Year's Eve.
<p/>Before leaving the room with Gabriel she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) signalled to Mr. Browne by frowning and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) forefinger in warning to and fro.
<p/>Mr. Browne nodded in answer and, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had gone, said to Freddy Malins: <div class="bookquote">``Now, then, Teddy, I'm going to fill you out a good glass of lemonade just to buck you up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Freddy Malins/Freddy/Malins</b></font>)</div><p/>Freddy Malins, who was nearing the climax of his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) story, waved the offer aside impatiently but Mr. Browne, having first called Freddy Malins' attention to a disarray in his (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) dress, filled out and handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) a full glass of lemonade.
<p/>But come on, Gabriel, into the drawing-room. '' Freddy Malins' left hand accepted the glass mechanically, his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) right hand being engaged in the mechanical readjustment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) dress.
<p/>Mr. Browne, whose face was once more wrinkling with mirth, poured out for himself a glass of whisky while Freddy Malins exploded, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) had well reached the climax of his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) story, in a kink of high-pitched bronchitic laughter and, setting down his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) untasted and overflowing glass, began to rub the knuckles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) left fist backwards and forwards into his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) left eye, repeating words of his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) last phrase as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) fit of laughter would allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>).
<p/>Gabriel could not listen while Mary Jane was playing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) Academy piece, full of runs and difficult passages, to the hushed drawing-room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) liked music but the piece she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was playing had no melody for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) doubted whether it had any melody for the other listeners, though they had begged Mary Jane to play something.
<p/>Four young men, who had come from the refreshment-room to stand in the doorway at the sound of the piano, had gone away quietly in couples after a few minutes.
<p/>The only persons who seemed to follow the music were Mary Jane herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) hands racing along the key-board or lifted from it at the pauses like those of a priestess in momentary imprecation, and Aunt Kate standing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) elbow to turn the page.
<p/>Gabriel's eyes, irritated by the floor, which glittered with beeswax under the heavy chandelier, wandered to the wall above the piano.
<p/>and beside it was a picture of the two murdered princes in the Tower which Aunt Julia had worked in red, blue and brown wools when she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) was a girl.
<p/>A picture of the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet hung there Probably in the school they had gone to as girls that kind of work had been taught for one year.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Romeo</b></font>) mother had worked for him (<font color='blue'><b>Romeo</b></font>) as a birthday present a waistcoat of purple tabinet, with little foxes' heads upon it, lined with brown satin and having round mulberry buttons.
<p/>It was strange that his (<font color='blue'><b>Romeo</b></font>) mother had had no musical talent though Aunt Kate used to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) the brains carrier of the Morkan family.
<p/>Both she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) and Julia had always seemed a little proud of their serious and matronly sister. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) photograph stood before the pierglass.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) held an open book on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) knees and was pointing out something in it to Constantine who, dressed in a man-o-war suit, lay at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) feet.
<p/>It was she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) who had chosen the name of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sons for she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was very sensible of the dignity of family life.
<p/>Thanks to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), Constantine was now senior curate in Balbrigan and, thanks to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), Gabriel himself had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) degree in the Royal University.
<p/>Some slighting phrases she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had used still rankled in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) memory; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had once spoken of Gretta as being country cute and that was not true of Gretta at all.
<p/>A shadow passed over his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) sullen opposition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) marriage. It was Gretta who had nursed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) during all her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) last long illness in their house at Monkstown.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) knew that Mary Jane must be near the end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) piece for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was playing again the opening melody with runs of scales after every bar and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) waited for the end the resentment died down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) heart.
<p/>The piece ended with a trill of octaves in the treble and a final deep octave in the bass. Great applause greeted Mary Jane as, blushing and rolling up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) music nervously, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) escaped from the room.
<p/>The most vigorous clapping came from the four young men in the doorway who had gone away to the refreshment-room at the beginning of the piece but had come back when the piano had stopped.
<p/>Lancers were arranged. Gabriel found himself partnered with Miss Ivors. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was a frank-mannered talkative young lady, with a freckled face and prominent brown eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did not wear a low-cut bodice and the large brooch which was fixed in the front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) collar bore on it an Irish device and motto.
<p/>When they had taken their places she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said abruptly: <div class="bookquote">``I have a crow to pluck with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``With me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) head gravely. '' What is it?'' asked Gabriel, smiling at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) solemn manner. '' Who is G. C.?'' answered Miss Ivors, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>).
<p/>Gabriel coloured and was about to knit his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) brows, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) did not understand, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said bluntly: <div class="bookquote">``O, innocent Amy!
<p/>I have found out that you write for The Daily Express. Now, aren't you ashamed of yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why should I be ashamed of myself?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>asked Gabriel, blinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) eyes and trying to smile. '' Well, I'm ashamed of you,'' said Miss Ivors frankly. ''
<p/>To say you'd write for a paper like that. I didn't think you were a West Briton. '' A look of perplexity appeared on Gabriel's face.
<p/>It was true that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) wrote a literary column every Wednesday in The Daily Express, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was paid fifteen shillings.
<p/>But that did not make him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) a West Briton surely. The books he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) received for review were almost more welcome than the paltry cheque.
<p/>Nearly every day when his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) teaching in the college was ended he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) used to wander down the quays to the second-hand booksellers, to Hickey's on Bachelor's Walk, to Web's or Massey's on Aston's Quay, or to O'Clohissey's in the by-street.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Aston</b></font>) loved to feel the covers and turn over the pages of newly printed books. He (<font color='blue'><b>Aston</b></font>) did not know how to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>booksellers</b></font>) charge.
<p/>But they were friends of many years' standing and their careers had been parallel, first at the University and then as teachers: he (<font color='blue'><b>Aston</b></font>) could not risk a grandiose phrase with her (<font color='blue'><b>booksellers</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Aston</b></font>) continued blinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Aston</b></font>) eyes and trying to smile and murmured lamely that he (<font color='blue'><b>Aston</b></font>) saw nothing political in writing reviews of books.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Aston</b></font>) wanted to say that literature was above politics. When their turn to cross had come he (<font color='blue'><b>Aston</b></font>) was still perplexed and inattentive.
<p/>Miss Ivors promptly took his (<font color='blue'><b>Aston</b></font>) hand in a warm grasp and said in a soft friendly tone: <div class="bookquote">``Of course, I was only joking.
<p/>Come, we cross now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ivors</b></font>)</div>When they were together again she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) spoke of the University question and Gabriel felt more at ease.
<p/>A friend of hers had shown her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) review of Browning's poems. That was how she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) had found out the secret: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) liked the review immensely.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) said suddenly: <div class="bookquote">``O, Mr. Conroy, will you come for an excursion to the Aran Isles this summer? We're going to stay there a whole month.
<p/>It will be splendid out in the Atlantic. You ought to come. Mr. Clancy is coming, and Mr. Kilkelly and Kathleen Kearney.
<p/>It would be splendid for Gretta too if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>)'d come. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>)'s from Connacht, isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) people are,'' said Gabriel shortly.
<p/>'' But you will come, won't you?'' said Miss Ivors, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) warm hand eagerly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) arm. '' The fact is,'' said Gabriel, <div class="bookquote">``I have just arranged to go--''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go where?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Ivors.
<p/>'' Well, you know, every year I go for a cycling tour with some fellows and so-- '' '' But where?
<p/>'' asked Miss Ivors. '' Well, we usually go to France or Belgium or perhaps Germany,'' said Gabriel awkwardly. '' And why do you go to France and Belgium,'' said Miss Ivors, <div class="bookquote">``instead of visiting your own land?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well,'' said Gabriel, <div class="bookquote">``it's partly to keep in touch with the languages and partly for a change.''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>'' And haven't you your own language to keep in touch with--Irish?'' asked Miss Ivors.
<p/>'' Well,'' said Gabriel, <div class="bookquote">``if it comes to that, you know, Irish is not my language. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>Their neighbours had turned to listen to the cross-examination.
<p/>Gabriel glanced right and left nervously and tried to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) good humour under the ordeal which was making a blush invade his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) forehead.
<p/>And haven't you your own land to visit,'' continued Miss Ivors, <div class="bookquote">``that you know nothing of, your own people, and your own country?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ivors</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``O, to tell you the truth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>retorted Gabriel suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sick of my own country, sick of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked Miss Ivors.
<p/>They had to go visiting together and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had not answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>), Miss Ivors said warmly: ``Of course, you've no answer.
<p/>Gabriel did not answer for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) retort had heated him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Why? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>repeated Miss Ivors. '' Gabriel tried to cover his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) agitation by taking part in the dance with great energy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) avoided her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) eyes for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had seen a sour expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) face. But when they met in the long chain he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was surprised to feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hand firmly pressed.
<p/>Then, just as the chain was about to start again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) stood on tiptoe and whispered into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) ear: <div class="bookquote">``West Briton!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When the lancers were over Gabriel went away to a remote corner of the room where Freddy Malins' mother was sitting.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) from under her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brows for a moment quizzically until he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) smiled. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a stout feeble old woman with white hair.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) voice had a catch in it like her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son's and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stuttered slightly. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been told that Freddy had come and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>) was nearly all right.
<p/>Gabriel asked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) whether she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had had a good crossing. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) married daughter in Glasgow and came to Dublin on a visit once a year.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) answered placidly that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had had a beautiful crossing and that the captain had been most attentive to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spoke also of the beautiful house her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter kept in Glasgow, and of all the friends they had there.
<p/>While her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tongue rambled on Gabriel tried to banish from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) mind all memory of the unpleasant incident with Miss Ivors.
<p/>Of course the girl or woman, or whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was, was an enthusiast but there was a time for all things.
<p/>Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) ought not to have answered her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) like that. But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had no right to call him (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) a West Briton before people, even in joke.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had tried to make him (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) ridiculous before people, heckling him (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) and staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rabbit's eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) wife making her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) way towards him (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) through the waltzing couples.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) reached him (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said into his (<font color='blue'><b>enthusiast</b></font>) ear: <div class="bookquote">``Gabriel, Aunt Kate wants to know won't you carve the goose as usual.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>)'s sending in the younger ones first as soon as this waltz is over so that we'll have the table to ourselves.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Daly will carve the ham and I'll do the pudding.'' '' All right,'' said Gabriel. '' <div class="bookquote">``Were you dancing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>asked Gabriel.
<p/>'' Of course I was. Didn't you see me? What row had you with Molly Ivors?'' <div class="bookquote">``No row. Why? Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) say so?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Something like that. I'm trying to get that Mr. D'Arcy to sing. He (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>)'s full of conceit, I think. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>There was no row,'' said Gabriel moodily, <div class="bookquote">``only she (<font color='blue'><b>Molly</b></font>) wanted me to go for a trip to the west of Ireland
<p/>and I said I wouldn't. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) wife clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands excitedly and gave a little jump. '' O, do go, Gabriel,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cried.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) for a moment, then turned to Mrs. Malins and said: <div class="bookquote">``There's a nice husband for you, Mrs. Malins.
<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) was threading her (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) way back across the room Mrs. Malins, without adverting to the interruption, went on to tell Gabriel what beautiful places there were in Scotland and beautiful scenery.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Malins</b></font>)</div>I'd love to see Galway again. '' <div class="bookquote">``You can go if you like,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel coldly. '' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) son-in-law brought them every year to the lakes and they used to go fishing.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) son-in-law was a splendid fisher. One day he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) caught a beautiful big fish and the man in the hotel cooked it for their dinner.
<p/>Gabriel hardly heard what she (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) said. Now that supper was coming near he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) began to think again about his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) speech and about the quotation.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) saw Freddy Malins coming across the room to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) mother Gabriel left the chair free for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) and retired into the embrasure of the window.
<p/>The room had already cleared and from the back room came the clatter of plates and knives. Those who still remained in the drawing-room seemed tired of dancing and were conversing quietly in little groups.
<p/>Gabriel's warm trembling fingers tapped the cold pane of the window. How cool it must be outside! How pleasant it would be to walk out alone, first along by the river and then through the park!
<p/>The snow would be lying on the branches of the trees and forming a bright cap on the top of the Wellington Monument.
<p/>How much more pleasant it would be there than at the supper-table! He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) ran over the headings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) speech: Irish hospitality, sad memories, the Three Graces, Paris, the quotation from Browning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) repeated to himself a phrase he (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) had written in his (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) review: <div class="bookquote">``One feels that one is listening to a thought-tormented music.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Miss Ivors had praised the review. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) sincere? Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) really any life of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) own behind all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) propagandism?
<p/>It unnerved him (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) would be at the supper-table, looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) spoke with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) critical quizzing eyes.
<p/>There had never been any ill-feeling between them until that night. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) would not be sorry to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) fail in his (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) speech.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) would say, alluding to Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia: <div class="bookquote">``Ladies and Gentlemen, the generation which is now on the wane among us may have had its faults but for my part I think it had certain qualities of hospitality, of humour, of humanity, which the new and very serious and hypereducated generation that is growing up around us seems to me to lack.
<p/>An idea came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) mind and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) courage. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Julia/Miss Julia</b></font>)</div>Very good: that was one for Miss Ivors. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) care that his (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) aunts were only two ignorant old women?
<p/>Mr. Browne was advancing from the door, gallantly escorting Aunt Julia, who leaned upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) arm, smiling and hanging her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) head.
<p/>An irregular musketry of applause escorted her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) also as far as the piano and then, as Mary Jane seated herself on the stool, and Aunt Julia, no longer smiling, half turned so as to pitch her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) voice fairly into the room, gradually ceased.
<p/>A murmur in the room attracted his (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) attention. Gabriel recognised the prelude. It was that of an old song of Aunt Julia's--Arrayed for the Bridal.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) voice, strong and clear in tone, attacked with great spirit the runs which embellish the air and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) sang very rapidly she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) did not miss even the smallest of the grace notes.
<p/>To follow the voice, without looking at the singer's face, was to feel and share the excitement of swift and secure flight.
<p/>Gabriel applauded loudly with all the others at the close of the song and loud applause was borne in from the invisible supper-table.
<p/>It sounded so genuine that a little colour struggled into Aunt Julia's face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) bent to replace in the music-stand the old leather-bound songbook that had her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) initials on the cover.
<p/>Freddy Malins, who had listened with his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) head perched sideways to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) better, was still applauding when everyone else had ceased and talking animatedly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) mother who nodded her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head gravely and slowly in acquiescence.
<p/>At last, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) could clap no more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) stood up suddenly and hurried across the room to Aunt Julia whose hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) seized and held in both his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) hands, shaking it when words failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) or the catch in his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) voice proved too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>).
<p/>'' I was just telling my mother,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I never heard you sing so well, never. No, I never heard your voice so good as it is tonight.
<p/>Now! Would you believe that now? That's the truth. Upon my word and honour that's the truth. I never heard your voice sound so fresh
<p/>and so... so clear and fresh, never. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Aunt Julia smiled broadly and murmured something about compliments as she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) released her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) hand from his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) grasp.
<p/>Mr. Browne extended his (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) open hand towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) and said to those who were near him (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) in the manner of a showman introducing a prodigy to an audience: ``Miss Julia Morkan, my latest discovery!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) was laughing very heartily at this himself when Freddy Malins turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) and said: <div class="bookquote">``Well, Browne, if you're serious you might make a worse discovery.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>All I can say is I never heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) sing half so well as long as I am coming here.
<p/>And that's the honest truth. '' '' Neither did I,'' said Mr. Browne. '' I think her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) voice has greatly improved.
<p/>Aunt Julia shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) shoulders and said with meek pride: <div class="bookquote">``Thirty years ago I hadn't a bad voice as voices go.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Julia/Miss Julia</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``I often told Julia,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Kate emphatically, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was simply thrown away in that choir. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) never would be said by me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) turned as if to appeal to the good sense of the others against a refractory child while Aunt Julia gazed in front of her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>), a vague smile of reminiscence playing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) face.
<p/>No,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Miss Kate</b></font>)</div>continued Aunt Kate, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) wouldn't be said or led by anyone, slaving there in that choir night and day, night and day.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Kate</b></font>)</div>'' Six o'clock on Christmas morning! And all for what?'' <div class="bookquote">``Well, isn't it for the honour of God, Aunt Kate?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary Jane/Mary</b></font>)</div>asked Mary Jane, twisting round on the piano-stool and smiling.
<p/>Aunt Kate turned fiercely on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) niece and said: ``I know all about the honour of God, Mary Jane, but I think it's not at all honourable for the pope to turn out the women out of the choirs that have slaved there all their lives and put little whipper-snappers of boys over their heads.
<p/>I suppose it is for the good of the Church if the pope does it. But it's not just, Mary Jane, and it's not right.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had worked herself into a passion and would have continued in defence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister for it was a sore subject with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) but Mary Jane, seeing that all the dancers had come back, intervened pacifically: ``Now, Aunt Kate, you're giving scandal to Mr. Browne who is of the other persuasion.
<p/>Aunt Kate turned to Mr. Browne, who was grinning at this allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) religion, and said hastily: <div class="bookquote">``O, I don't question the pope's being right.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Browne/Browne</b></font>)</div>'' I'm only a stupid old woman and I wouldn't presume to do such a thing. But there's such a thing as common everyday politeness and gratitude.
<p/>And besides, Aunt Kate,'' said Mary Jane, <div class="bookquote">``we really are all hungry and when we are hungry we are all very quarrelsome.
<p/>And if I were in Julia's place I'd tell that Father Healey straight up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Healey</b></font>) face... ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary Jane/Mary</b></font>)</div>'' '' ''
<p/>And when we are thirsty we are also quarrelsome,'' added Mr. Browne. '' So that we had better go to supper,'' said Mary Jane, <div class="bookquote">``and finish the discussion afterwards.
<p/>On the landing outside the drawing-room Gabriel found his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) wife and Mary Jane trying to persuade Miss Ivors to stay for supper.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary Jane/Mary</b></font>)</div>But Miss Ivors, who had put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) hat and was buttoning her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) cloak, would not stay. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) did not feel in the least hungry and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) had already overstayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) time.
<p/>'' But only for ten minutes, Molly,'' said Mrs. Conroy. '' That won't delay you.'' '' To take a pick itself,'' said Mary Jane, <div class="bookquote">``after all your dancing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary Jane/Mary</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I really couldn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ivors. '' I am afraid you didn't enjoy yourself at all,'' said Mary Jane hopelessly.
<p/>'' Ever so much, I assure you,'' said Miss Ivors, <div class="bookquote">``but you really must let me run off now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ivors</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Gabriel hesitated a moment and said: <div class="bookquote">``If you will allow me, Miss Ivors, I'll see you home if you are really obliged to go.
<p/>But how can you get home?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Conroy. '' O, it's only two steps up the quay. '' '' But Miss Ivors broke away from them.
<p/>'' I won't hear of it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) cried. '' For goodness' sake go in to your suppers and don't mind me.
<p/>I'm quite well able to take care of myself.'' '' Well, you're the comical girl, Molly,'' said Mrs. Conroy frankly. ''
<p/>Mary Jane gazed after her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), a moody puzzled expression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) face, while Mrs. Conroy leaned over the banisters to listen for the hall-door.
<p/>Beannacht libh,'' cried Miss Ivors, with a laugh, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Conroy</b></font>) ran down the staircase. Gabriel asked himself was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) the cause of her (<font color='blue'><b>Conroy</b></font>) abrupt departure.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Conroy</b></font>) did not seem to be in ill humour: she (<font color='blue'><b>Conroy</b></font>) had gone away laughing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) stared blankly down the staircase.
<p/>At the moment Aunt Kate came toddling out of the supper-room, almost wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hands in despair. '' Where is Gabriel?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cried. '' Where on earth is Gabriel? There's everyone waiting in there, stage to let, and nobody to carve the goose!''
<p/>'' Here I am, Aunt Kate! '' cried Gabriel, with sudden animation, <div class="bookquote">``ready to carve a flock of geese, if necessary.
<p/>A fat brown goose lay at one end of the table and at the other end, on a bed of creased paper strewn with sprigs of parsley, lay a great ham, stripped of its outer skin and peppered over with crust crumbs, a neat paper frill round its shin and beside this was a round of spiced beef.
<p/>Between these rival ends ran parallel lines of side-dishes: two little minsters of jelly, red and yellow; a shallow dish full of blocks of blancmange and red jam, a large green leaf-shaped dish with a stalk-shaped handle, on which lay bunches of purple raisins and peeled almonds, a companion dish on which lay a solid rectangle of Smyrna figs, a dish of custard topped with grated nutmeg, a small bowl full of chocolates and sweets wrapped in gold and silver papers and a glass vase in which stood some tall celery stalks.
<p/>In the centre of the table there stood, as sentries to a fruit-stand which upheld a pyramid of oranges and American apples, two squat old-fashioned decanters of cut glass, one containing port and the other dark sherry.
<p/>On the closed square piano a pudding in a huge yellow dish lay in waiting and behind it were three squads of bottles of stout and ale and minerals, drawn up according to the colours of their uniforms, the first two black, with brown and red labels, the third and smallest squad white, with transverse green sashes.
<p/>Gabriel took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) seat boldly at the head of the table and, having looked to the edge of the carver, plunged his (<font color='blue'><b>carver</b></font>) fork firmly into the goose.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>carver</b></font>) felt quite at ease now for he (<font color='blue'><b>carver</b></font>) was an expert carver and liked nothing better than to find himself at the head of a well-laden table.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>'' Miss Furlong, what shall I send you? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>carver</b></font>) asked. '' A wing or a slice of the breast?''
<p/>While Gabriel and Miss Daly exchanged plates of goose and plates of ham and spiced beef Lily went from guest to guest with a dish of hot floury potatoes wrapped in a white napkin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just a small slice of the breast.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Miss Higgins, what for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O, anything at all, Mr. Conroy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary Jane/Mary</b></font>)</div>This was Mary Jane's idea and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had also suggested apple sauce for the goose
<p/>but Aunt Kate had said that plain roast goose without any apple sauce had always been good enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) might never eat worse.
<p/>Mary Jane waited on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) pupils and saw that they got the best slices and Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia opened and carried across from the piano bottles of stout and ale for the gentlemen and bottles of minerals for the ladies.
<p/>There was a great deal of confusion and laughter and noise, the noise of orders and counter-orders, of knives and forks, of corks and glass-stoppers.
<p/>Everyone protested loudly so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) compromised by taking a long draught of stout for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had found the carving hot work.
<p/>Mary Jane settled down quietly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) supper but Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia were still toddling round the table, walking on each other's heels, getting in each other's way and giving each other unheeded orders.
<p/>Gabriel began to carve second helpings as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had finished the first round without serving himself. Mr. Browne begged of them to sit down and eat their suppers and so did Gabriel
<p/>but they said there was time enough, so that, at last, Freddy Malins stood up and, capturing Aunt Kate, plumped her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) chair amid general laughter.
<p/>When everyone had been well served Gabriel said, smiling: <div class="bookquote">``Now, if anyone wants a little more of what vulgar people call stuffing
<p/>A chorus of voices invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) to begin his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) own supper and Lily came forward with three potatoes which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) had reserved for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>).
<p/>Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel amiably, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) took another preparatory draught, <div class="bookquote">``kindly forget my existence, ladies and gentlemen, for a few minutes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) set to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) supper and took no part in the conversation with which the table covered Lily's removal of the plates.
<p/>let him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>Lily</b></font>) speak. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' The subject of talk was the opera company which was then at the Theatre Royal.
<p/>Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, the tenor, a dark-complexioned young man with a smart moustache, praised very highly the leading contralto of the company but Miss Furlong thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Furlong</b></font>) had a rather vulgar style of production.
<p/>Freddy Malins said there was a Negro chieftain singing in the second part of the Gaiety pantomime who had one of the finest tenor voices he (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) had ever heard.
<p/>'' Have you heard him (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>)? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) asked Mr. Bartell D'Arcy across the table. '' No,'' answered Mr. Bartell D'Arcy carelessly.
<p/>'' Because,'' Freddy Malins explained, <div class="bookquote">``now I'd be curious to hear your opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>). I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) has a grand voice.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddy Malins/Freddy/Malins</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It takes Teddy to find out the really good things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Browne/Browne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Browne familiarly to the table. '' And why couldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) have a voice too?
<p/>'' asked Freddy Malins sharply. '' Is it because he (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>)'s only a black?'' Nobody answered this question and Mary Jane led the table back to the legitimate opera.
<p/>One of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) pupils had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) a pass for Mignon. Of course it was very fine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said, but it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) think of poor Georgina Burns.
<p/>Mr. Browne could go back farther still, to the old Italian companies that used to come to Dublin--Tietjens, Ilma de Murzka, Campanini, the great Trebelli, Giuglini, Ravelli, Aramburo.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) told too of how the top gallery of the old Royal used to be packed night after night, of how one night an Italian tenor had sung five encores to Let me like a Soldier fall, introducing a high C every time, and of how the gallery boys would sometimes in their enthusiasm unyoke the horses from the carriage of some great prima donna and pull her (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>) themselves through the streets to her (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>) hotel.
<p/>Those were the days, he (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>) said, when there was something like singing to be heard in Dublin. Why did they never play the grand old operas now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Soldier</b></font>) asked, Dinorah, Lucrezia Borgia?
<p/>Because they could not get the voices to sing them: that was why. '' Oh, well,'' said Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, <div class="bookquote">``I presume there are as good singers today as there were then.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bartell D'Arcy/Mr. D'Arcy/Bartell D'Arcy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where are they?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Browne/Browne</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Browne defiantly. '' In London, Paris, Milan,'' said Mr. Bartell D'Arcy warmly. '' I suppose Caruso, for example, is quite as good, if not better than any of the men you have mentioned.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Maybe so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Browne/Browne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Browne. '' But I may tell you I doubt it strongly.'' <div class="bookquote">``O, I'd give anything to hear Caruso sing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary Jane/Mary</b></font>)</div>said Mary Jane.
<p/>'' For me,'' said Aunt Kate, who had been picking a bone, <div class="bookquote">``there was only one tenor. To please me, I mean.
<p/>But I suppose none of you ever heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Kate</b></font>)</div>'' Who was he (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>), Miss Morkan? '' asked Mr. Bartell D'Arcy politely.
<p/>'' His (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) name,'' said Aunt Kate, <div class="bookquote">``was Parkinson. I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Parkinson</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Parkinson</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Parkinson</b></font>) prime and I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Parkinson</b></font>) had then the purest tenor voice that was ever put into a man's throat.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Kate</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Strange,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bartell D'Arcy/Mr. D'Arcy/Bartell D'Arcy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bartell D'Arcy. '' I never even heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>). '' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, Miss Morkan is right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Browne/Browne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Browne.
<p/>'' I remember hearing of old Parkinson but he (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>)'s too far back for me.'' '' A beautiful, pure, sweet, mellow English tenor,'' said Aunt Kate with enthusiasm.
<p/>Gabriel having finished, the huge pudding was transferred to the table. The clatter of forks and spoons began again. Gabriel's wife served out spoonfuls of the pudding and passed the plates down the table.
<p/>Midway down they were held up by Mary Jane, who replenished them with raspberry or orange jelly or with blancmange and jam.
<p/>The pudding was of Aunt Julia's making and she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) received praises for it from all quarters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) herself said that it was not quite brown enough.
<p/>'' Well, I hope, Miss Morkan,'' said Mr. Browne, <div class="bookquote">``that I'm brown enough for you because, you know, I'm all brown.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Browne/Browne</b></font>)</div>All the gentlemen, except Gabriel, ate some of the pudding out of compliment to Aunt Julia. As Gabriel never ate sweets the celery had been left for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>).
<p/>Freddy Malins also took a stalk of celery and ate it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) pudding. He (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) had been told that celery was a capital thing for the blood
<p/>Mrs. Malins, who had been silent all through the supper, said that her (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) son was going down to Mount Melleray in a week or so.
<p/>The table then spoke of Mount Melleray, how bracing the air was down there, how hospitable the monks were and how they never asked for a penny-piece from their guests.
<p/>And do you mean to say,'' asked Mr. Browne incredulously, <div class="bookquote">``that a chap can go down there and put up there as if it were a hotel and live on the fat of the land and then come away without paying anything?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Browne/Browne</b></font>)</div><p/>and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was just then under doctor's care. '' <div class="bookquote">``O, most people give some donation to the monastery when they leave.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary Jane/Mary</b></font>)</div>said Mary Jane.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was astonished to hear that the monks never spoke, got up at two in the morning and slept in their coffins.
<p/>'' I wish we had an institution like that in our Church,'' said Mr. Browne candidly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) asked what they did it for.
<p/>'' That's the rule of the order,'' said Aunt Kate firmly. '' Yes, but why?'' asked Mr. Browne. Aunt Kate repeated that it was the rule, that was all.
<p/>Freddy Malins explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>), as best he (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) could, that the monks were trying to make up for the sins committed by all the sinners in the outside world.
<p/>The explanation was not very clear for Mr. Browne grinned and said: <div class="bookquote">``I like that idea very much but wouldn't a comfortable spring bed do them as well as a coffin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Browne/Browne</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Browne still seemed not to understand. '' The coffin,'' said Mary Jane, <div class="bookquote">``is to remind them of their last end.
<p/>As the subject had grown lugubrious it was buried in a silence of the table during which Mrs. Malins could be heard saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) neighbour in an indistinct undertone:
<p/>The raisins and almonds and figs and apples and oranges and chocolates and sweets were now passed about the table and Aunt Julia invited all the guests to have either port or sherry.
<p/>At first Mr. Bartell D'Arcy refused to take either but one of his (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) neighbours nudged him (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) and whispered something to him (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) glass to be filled.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary Jane/Mary</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They are very good men, the monks, very pious men. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Gradually as the last glasses were being filled the conversation ceased.
<p/>A pause followed, broken only by the noise of the wine and by unsettlings of chairs. The Misses Morkan, all three, looked down at the tablecloth.
<p/>Someone coughed once or twice and then a few gentlemen patted the table gently as a signal for silence. The silence came and Gabriel pushed back his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) chair.
<p/>The patting at once grew louder in encouragement and then ceased altogether. Gabriel leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) ten trembling fingers on the tablecloth and smiled nervously at the company.
<p/>Meeting a row of upturned faces he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) eyes to the chandelier. The piano was playing a waltz tune and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) could hear the skirts sweeping against the drawing-room door.
<p/>People, perhaps, were standing in the snow on the quay outside, gazing up at the lighted windows and listening to the waltz music.
<p/>The air was pure there. In the distance lay the park where the trees were weighted with snow. The Wellington Monument wore a gleaming cap of snow that flashed westward over the white field of Fifteen Acres.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) began: ``Ladies and Gentlemen, <div class="bookquote">``It has fallen to my lot this evening, as in years past, to perform a very pleasing task but a task for which I am afraid my poor powers as a speaker are all too inadequate.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gentlemen</b></font>)</div><p/>But, however that may be, I can only ask you tonight to take the will for the deed and to lend me your attention for a few moments while I endeavour to express to you in words what my feelings are on this occasion.
<p/>Ladies and Gentlemen, it is not the first time that we have gathered together under this hospitable roof, around this hospitable board.
<p/>It is not the first time that we have been the recipients--or perhaps, I had better say, the victims--of the hospitality of certain good ladies.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Browne/Browne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Browne. '' '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) made a circle in the air with his (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) arm and paused. Everyone laughed or smiled at Aunt Kate and Aunt Julia and Mary Jane who all turned crimson with pleasure.
<p/>Gabriel went on more boldly: ``I feel more strongly with every recurring year that our country has no tradition which does it so much honour and which it should guard so jealously as that of its hospitality.
<p/>It is a tradition that is unique as far as my experience goes -LRB-and I have visited not a few places abroad-RRB- among the modern nations.
<p/>But granted even that, it is, to my mind, a princely failing, and one that I trust will long be cultivated among us.
<p/>Some would say, perhaps, that with us it is rather a failing than anything to be boasted of. Of one thing, at least, I am sure.
<p/>As long as this one roof shelters the good ladies aforesaid--and I wish from my heart it may do so for many and many a long year to come--the tradition of genuine warm-hearted courteous Irish hospitality, which our forefathers have handed down to us and which we in turn must hand down to our descendants, is still alive among us.
<p/>It shot through Gabriel's mind that Miss Ivors was not there and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ivors</b></font>) had gone away discourteously: and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said with confidence in himself: ``Ladies and Gentlemen, <div class="bookquote">``A new generation is growing up in our midst, a generation actuated by new ideas and new principles.
<p/>It is serious and enthusiastic for these new ideas and its enthusiasm, even when it is misdirected, is, I believe, in the main sincere.
<p/>But we are living in a sceptical and, if I may use the phrase, a thought-tormented age: and sometimes I fear that this new generation, educated or hypereducated as it is, will lack those qualities of humanity, of hospitality, of kindly humour which belonged to an older day.
<p/>Listening tonight to the names of all those great singers of the past it seemed to me, I must confess, that we were living in a less spacious age.
<p/>Those days might, without exaggeration, be called spacious days: and if they are gone beyond recall let us hope, at least, that in gatherings such as this we shall still speak of them with pride and affection, still cherish in our hearts the memory of those dead and gone great ones whose fame the world will not willingly let die.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gentlemen</b></font>)</div><p/>But yet,'' continued Gabriel, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) voice falling into a softer inflection, <div class="bookquote">``there are always in gatherings such as this sadder thoughts that will recur to our minds: thoughts of the past, of youth, of changes, of absent faces that we miss here tonight.
<p/>Our path through life is strewn with many such sad memories: and were we to brood upon them always we could not find the heart to go on bravely with our work among the living.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>A hearty murmur of assent ran round the table. <div class="bookquote">``Hear, hear!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Browne/Browne</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Browne loudly. '' We have all of us living duties and living affections which claim, and rightly claim, our strenuous endeavours.
<p/>'' Therefore, I will not linger on the past. I will not let any gloomy moralising intrude upon us here tonight.
<p/>We are met here as friends, in the spirit of good-fellowship, as colleagues, also to a certain extent, in the true spirit of camaraderie, and as the guests of--what shall I call them?--the Three Graces of the Dublin musical world.
<p/>Here we are gathered together for a brief moment from the bustle and rush of our everyday routine. '' The table burst into applause and laughter at this allusion.
<p/>Aunt Julia vainly asked each of her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) neighbours in turn to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) what Gabriel had said. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) says we are the Three Graces, Aunt Julia,'' said Mary Jane.
<p/>Aunt Julia did not understand but she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) looked up, smiling, at Gabriel, who continued in the same vein: ``Ladies and Gentlemen, ``I will not attempt to play tonight the part that Paris played on another occasion.
<p/>I will not attempt to choose between them. The task would be an invidious one and one beyond my poor powers.
<p/>For when I view them in turn, whether it be our chief hostess herself, whose good heart, whose too good heart, has become a byword with all who know her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>), or her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) sister, who seems to be gifted with perennial youth and whose singing must have been a surprise and a revelation to us all tonight, or, last but not least, when I consider our youngest hostess, talented, cheerful, hard-working and the best of nieces, I confess, Ladies and Gentlemen, that I do not know to which of them I should award the prize.
<p/>Gabriel glanced down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) aunts and, seeing the large smile on Aunt Julia's face and the tears which had risen to Aunt Kate's eyes, hastened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) close.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) glass of port gallantly, while every member of the company fingered a glass expectantly, and said loudly: <div class="bookquote">``Let us toast them all three together.
<p/>Let us drink to their health, wealth, long life, happiness and prosperity and may they long continue to hold the proud and self-won position which they hold in their profession and the position of honour and affection which they hold in our hearts.
<p/>All the guests stood up, glass in hand, and turning towards the three seated ladies, sang in unison, with Mr. Browne as leader:
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>every member</b></font>)</div>'' For they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows, Which nobody can deny.
<p/>Freddy Malins beat time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) pudding-fork and the singers turned towards one another, as if in melodious conference, while they sang with emphasis: Unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) tells a lie, Unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) tells a lie.
<p/>Aunt Kate was making frank use of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) handkerchief and even Aunt Julia seemed moved. Then, turning once more towards their hostesses, they sang:
<p/>For they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows, For they are jolly gay fellows, Which nobody can deny.
<p/>The acclamation which followed was taken up beyond the door of the supper-room by many of the other guests and renewed time after time, Freddy Malins acting as officer with his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) fork on high.
<p/>The piercing morning air came into the hall where they were standing so that Aunt Kate said: <div class="bookquote">``Close the door, somebody.
<p/>Mrs. Malins will get her (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) death of cold.''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Miss Kate</b></font>)</div>'' Browne is out there, Aunt Kate,'' said Mary Jane. '' Browne is everywhere,'' said Aunt Kate, lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) voice.
<p/>Mary Jane laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) tone. '' Really,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said archly, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) is very attentive.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) has been laid on here like the gas,'' said Aunt Kate in the same tone, ``all during the Christmas.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) laughed herself this time good-humouredly and then added quickly: <div class="bookquote">``But tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) to come in, Mary Jane, and close the door.
<p/>At that moment the hall-door was opened and Mr. Browne came in from the doorstep, laughing as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) heart would break.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) was dressed in a long green overcoat with mock astrakhan cuffs and collar and wore on his (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) head an oval fur cap.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>I hope to goodness he (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) didn't hear me. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) pointed down the snow-covered quay from where the sound of shrill prolonged whistling was borne in.
<p/>Gabriel advanced from the little pantry behind the office, struggling into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) overcoat and, looking round the hall, said: <div class="bookquote">``Gretta not down yet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Teddy will have all the cabs in Dublin out,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Teddy</b></font>) said. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>)'s getting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) things, Gabriel,'' said Aunt Kate.
<p/>'' Who's playing up there?'' asked Gabriel. '' Nobody. They're all gone. '' <div class="bookquote">``O no, Aunt Kate,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary Jane/Mary</b></font>)</div>said Mary Jane. ''
<p/>Mary Jane glanced at Gabriel and Mr. Browne and said with a shiver: <div class="bookquote">``It makes me feel cold to look at you two gentlemen muffled up like that.
<p/>Bartell D'Arcy and Miss O'Callaghan aren't gone yet. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Browne/Browne</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Someone is fooling at the piano anyhow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel. I wouldn't like to face your journey home at this hour.''
<p/>I'd like nothing better this minute,'' said Mr. Browne stoutly, <div class="bookquote">``than a rattling fine walk in the country or a fast drive with a good spanking goer between the shafts.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Browne/Browne</b></font>)</div>'' '' We used to have a very good horse and trap at home,'' said Aunt Julia sadly. '' The never-to-be-forgotten Johnny,'' said Mary Jane, laughing.
<p/>The late lamented Patrick Morkan, our grandfather, that is,'' explained Gabriel, <div class="bookquote">``commonly known in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) later years as the old gentleman, was a glue-boiler.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div><p/>Aunt Kate and Gabriel laughed too. '' Why, what was wonderful about Johnny?'' asked Mr. Browne. '' <div class="bookquote">``O, now, Gabriel,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Kate, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had a starch mill.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Miss Kate</b></font>)</div>'' Well, glue or starch,'' said Gabriel, <div class="bookquote">``the old gentleman had a horse by the name of Johnny. And Johnny used to work in the old gentleman's mill, walking round and round in order to drive the mill.
<p/>One fine day the old gentleman thought he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)'d like to drive out with the quality to a military review in the park.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div><p/>That was all very well; but now comes the tragic part about Johnny. '' The Lord have mercy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) soul,'' said Aunt Kate compassionately.
<p/>So the old gentleman, as I said, harnessed Johnny and put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) very best tall hat and his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) very best stock collar and drove out in grand style from his (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) ancestral mansion somewhere near Back Lane, I think.
<p/>Everyone laughed, even Mrs. Malins, at Gabriel's manner and Aunt Kate said: <div class="bookquote">``O, now, Gabriel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) didn't live in Back Lane, really.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Miss Kate</b></font>)</div>Amen,'' said Gabriel. '' '' Only the mill was there. '' <div class="bookquote">``Out from the mansion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) forefathers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>continued Gabriel, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) drove with Johnny.
<p/>And everything went on beautifully until Johnny came in sight of King Billy's statue: and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Johnny</b></font>) fell in love with the horse
<p/>King Billy sits on or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) was back again in the mill, anyhow he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) began to walk round the statue.
<p/>Round and round he (<font color='blue'><b>Billy</b></font>) went,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel, <div class="bookquote">``and the old gentleman, who was a very pompous old gentleman, was highly indignant. '
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>Gabriel paced in a circle round the hall in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) goloshes amid the laughter of the others. '' Go on, sir!
<p/>The peal of laughter which followed Gabriel's imitation of the incident was interrupted by a resounding knock at the hall door.
<p/>What do you mean, sir? Johnny! Johnny! Most extraordinary conduct! Can't understand the horse!' '' Mary Jane ran to open it and let in Freddy Malins.
<p/>Freddy Malins, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) hat well back on his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) head and his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) shoulders humped with cold, was puffing and steaming after his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) exertions.
<p/>'' I could only get one cab,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) said. '' O, we'll find another along the quay,'' said Gabriel. '' Yes,'' said Aunt Kate.
<p/>Mrs. Malins was helped down the front steps by her (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) son and Mr. Browne and, after many manoeuvres, hoisted into the cab.
<p/>Freddy Malins clambered in after her (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) and spent a long time settling her (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) on the seat, Mr. Browne helping him (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) with advice.
<p/>'' Better not keep Mrs. Malins standing in the draught. '' At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) was settled comfortably and Freddy Malins invited Mr. Browne into the cab.
<p/>There was a good deal of confused talk, and then Mr. Browne got into the cab. The cabman settled his (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) rug over his (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) knees, and bent down for the address.
<p/>The confusion grew greater and the cabman was directed differently by Freddy Malins and Mr. Browne, each of whom had his (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) head out through a window of the cab.
<p/>The difficulty was to know where to drop Mr. Browne along the route, and Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane helped the discussion from the doorstep with cross-directions and contradictions and abundance of laughter.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) popped his (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) head in and out of the window every moment to the great danger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) hat, and told his (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) mother how the discussion was progressing, till at last Mr. Browne shouted to the bewildered cabman above the din of everybody's laughter: <div class="bookquote">``Do you know Trinity College?''
 (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div><p/>As for Freddy Malins he (<font color='blue'><b>Malins</b></font>) was speechless with laughter. '' Yes, sir,'' said the cabman. '' Well, drive bang up against Trinity College gates,'' said Mr. Browne, <div class="bookquote">``and then we'll tell you where to go.
<p/>You understand now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Browne/Browne</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, sir,'' said the cabman. <div class="bookquote">``Make like a bird for Trinity College.''  (<font color='red'><b>the cabman</b></font>)</div>'' Right, sir,'' said the cabman.
<p/>The horse was whipped up and the cab rattled off along the quay amid a chorus of laughter and adieus. Gabriel had not gone to the door with the others.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was in a dark part of the hall gazing up the staircase. A woman was standing near the top of the first flight, in the shadow also.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) could see the terra-cotta and salmon-pink panels of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) skirt which the shadow made appear black and white.
<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) wife. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was leaning on the banisters, listening to something. Gabriel was surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stillness and strained his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) ear to listen also.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) could hear little save the noise of laughter and dispute on the front steps, a few chords struck on the piano and a few notes of a man's voice singing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood still in the gloom of the hall, trying to catch the air that the voice was singing and gazing up at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked himself what is a woman standing on the stairs in the shadow, listening to distant music, a symbol of.
<p/>There was grace and mystery in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) attitude as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were a symbol of something. If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were a painter he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would paint her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in that attitude.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) blue felt hat would show off the bronze of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair against the darkness and the dark panels of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) skirt would show off the light ones.
<p/>Distant Music he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would call the picture if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were a painter. The hall-door was closed; and Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane came down the hall, still laughing.
<p/>'' Well, isn't Freddy terrible?'' said Mary Jane. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddy</b></font>)'s really terrible. '' Gabriel said nothing but pointed up the stairs towards where his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) wife was standing.
<p/>Now that the hall-door was closed the voice and the piano could be heard more clearly. Gabriel held up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hand for them to be silent.
<p/>The song seemed to be in the old Irish tonality and the singer seemed uncertain both of his (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) words and of his (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) voice.
<p/>The voice, made plaintive by distance and by the singer's hoarseness, faintly illuminated the cadence of the air with words expressing grief: O, the rain falls on my heavy locks
<p/>And the dew wets my skin, My babe lies cold... '' O,'' exclaimed Mary Jane. '' It's Bartell D'Arcy singing and he (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) wouldn't sing all the night.
<p/>Mary Jane brushed past the others and ran to the staircase, but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) reached it the singing stopped and the piano was closed abruptly.
<p/>O, I'll get him (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) to sing a song before he (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) goes. '' <div class="bookquote">``O, do, Mary Jane,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Kate. '' O, what a pity!''
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cried. '' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) coming down, Gretta? '' Gabriel heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) wife answer yes and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) come down towards them.
<p/>O, Mr. D'Arcy,'' cried Mary Jane, <div class="bookquote">``it's downright mean of you to break off like that when we were all in raptures listening to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mary Jane/Mary</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have been at him (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) all the evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss O'Callaghan</b></font>)</div>said Miss O'Callaghan, <div class="bookquote">``and Mrs. Conroy, too, and he (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) told us he (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) had a dreadful cold and couldn't sing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss O'Callaghan</b></font>)</div><p/>A few steps behind her (<font color='blue'><b>O'Callaghan</b></font>) were Mr. Bartell D'Arcy and Miss O'Callaghan. '' <div class="bookquote">``O, Mr. D'Arcy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Kate, <div class="bookquote">``now that was a great fib to tell.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Miss Kate</b></font>)</div>'' Can't you see that I'm as hoarse as a crow?'' said Mr. D'Arcy roughly. He (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) went into the pantry hastily and put on his (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) overcoat.
<p/>The others, taken aback by his (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) rude speech, could find nothing to say. Aunt Kate wrinkled her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) brows and made signs to the others to drop the subject.
<p/>Mr. D'Arcy stood swathing his (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) neck carefully and frowning. '' It's the weather,'' said Aunt Julia, after a pause. '' Yes, everybody has colds,'' said Aunt Kate readily, <div class="bookquote">``everybody.
<p/>They say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Kate/Miss Kate</b></font>)</div>said Mary Jane, <div class="bookquote">``we haven't had snow like it for thirty years; and I read this morning in the newspapers that the snow is general all over Ireland.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary Jane/Mary</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``I love the look of snow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Julia sadly. '' So do I,'' said Miss O'Callaghan. ''
<p/>I think Christmas is never really Christmas unless we have the snow on the ground.'' '' But poor Mr. D'Arcy doesn't like the snow,'' said Aunt Kate, smiling.
<p/>Mr. D'Arcy came from the pantry, fully swathed and buttoned, and in a repentant tone told them the history of his (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) cold.
<p/>Everyone gave him (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) advice and said it was a great pity and urged him (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) to be very careful of his (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) throat in the night air.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was standing right under the dusty fanlight and the flame of the gas lit up the rich bronze of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) hair, which he (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) drying at the fire a few days before.
<p/>Gabriel watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) wife, who did not join in the conversation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) was in the same attitude and seemed unaware of the talk about her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>).
<p/>At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) turned towards them and Gabriel saw that there was colour on her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) cheeks and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) eyes were shining.
<p/>A sudden tide of joy went leaping out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) heart. '' Mr. D'Arcy,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``what is the name of that song you were singing?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' It's called The Lass of Aughrim,'' said Mr. D'Arcy, <div class="bookquote">``but I couldn't remember it properly. Why? Do you know it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bartell D'Arcy/Mr. D'Arcy/Bartell D'Arcy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``The Lass of Aughrim,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) repeated. '' I couldn't think of the name.'' '' It's a very nice air,'' said Mary Jane.
<p/>'' I'm sorry you were not in voice tonight.'' <div class="bookquote">``Now, Mary Jane,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Kate</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Kate, ``don't annoy Mr. D'Arcy. I won't have him (<font color='blue'><b>D'Arcy</b></font>) annoyed.
<p/>Seeing that all were ready to start she (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) shepherded them to the door, where good-night was said: <div class="bookquote">``Well, good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks for the pleasant evening.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Gabriel. Good-night, Gretta!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks ever so much. Goodnight, Aunt Julia. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O, good-night, Gretta, I didn't see you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Mr. D'Arcy. Good-night, Miss O'Callaghan.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Miss Morkan. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Good-night, again. '' '' Good-night, all. Safe home. '' <div class="bookquote">``Good-night.
<p/>Good night. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The morning was still dark. A dull, yellow light brooded over the houses and the river; and the sky seemed to be descending.
<p/>It was slushy underfoot; and only streaks and patches of snow lay on the roofs, on the parapets of the quay and on the area railings.
<p/>The lamps were still burning redly in the murky air and, across the river, the palace of the Four Courts stood out menacingly against the heavy sky.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was walking on before him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) with Mr. Bartell D'Arcy, her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) shoes in a brown parcel tucked under one arm and her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) hands holding her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) skirt up from the slush.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had no longer any grace of attitude, but Gabriel's eyes were still bright with happiness. The blood went bounding along his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) veins; and the thoughts went rioting through his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) brain, proud, joyful, tender, valorous.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was walking on before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) so lightly and so erect that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) longed to run after her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) noiselessly, catch her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) by the shoulders and say something foolish and affectionate into her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) ear.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) so frail that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) longed to defend her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) against something and then to be alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>).
<p/>Moments of their secret life together burst like stars upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) memory. A heliotrope envelope was lying beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) breakfast-cup and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was caressing it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Birds were twittering in the ivy and the sunny web of the curtain was shimmering along the floor: he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) could not eat for happiness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was standing with her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) in the cold, looking in through a grated window at a man making bottles in a roaring furnace.
<p/>They were standing on the crowded platform and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was placing a ticket inside the warm palm of her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) glove. It was very cold.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) face, fragrant in the cold air, was quite close to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called out to the man at the furnace:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the fire hot, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>But the man could not hear with the noise of the furnace. It was just as well.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have answered rudely. A wave of yet more tender joy escaped from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart and went coursing in warm flood along his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arteries.
<p/>Like the tender fire of stars moments of their life together, that no one knew of or would ever know of, broke upon and illumined his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) memory.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) longed to recall to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) those moments, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forget the years of their dull existence together and remember only their moments of ecstasy.
<p/>For the years, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt, had not quenched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul or hers. Their children, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) writing, her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) household cares had not quenched all their souls' tender fire.
<p/>In one letter that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had written to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had said: <div class="bookquote">``Why is it that words like these seem to me so dull and cold?
<p/>Is it because there is no word tender enough to be your name? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Like distant music these words that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had written years before were borne towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from the past.
<p/>When the others had gone away, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were in the room in their hotel, then they would be alone together.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) longed to be alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would call her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) softly: <div class="bookquote">``Gretta!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not hear at once: she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be undressing.
<p/>Then something in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice would strike her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would turn and look at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).... At the corner of Winetavern Street they met a cab.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was glad of its rattling noise as it saved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from conversation. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was looking out of the window and seemed tired.
<p/>The horse galloped along wearily under the murky morning sky, dragging his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old rattling box after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heels, and Gabriel was again in a cab with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), galloping to catch the boat, galloping to their honeymoon.
<p/>As the cab drove across O'Connell Bridge Miss O'Callaghan said: <div class="bookquote">``They say you never cross O'Connell Bridge without seeing a white horse.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss O'Callaghan</b></font>)</div><p/>The others spoke only a few words, pointing out some building or street. <div class="bookquote">``I see a white man this time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel.
<p/>'' Where? '' asked Mr. Bartell D'Arcy. Gabriel pointed to the statue, on which lay patches of snow. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) nodded familiarly to it and waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hand.
<p/>When the cab drew up before the hotel, Gabriel jumped out and, in spite of Mr. Bartell D'Arcy's protest, paid the driver.
<p/>'' Good-night, Dan,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) said gaily. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) gave the man a shilling over his (<font color='blue'><b>Dan</b></font>) fare. The man saluted and said: <div class="bookquote">``A prosperous New Year to you, sir.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) leaned for a moment on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm in getting out of the cab and while standing at the curbstone, bidding the others good-night.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>'' The same to you,'' said Gabriel cordially. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) leaned lightly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) arm, as lightly as when she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had danced with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) a few hours before.
<p/>But now, after the kindling again of so many memories, the first touch of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) body, musical and strange and perfumed, sent through him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) a keen pang of lust.
<p/>Under cover of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) silence he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) arm closely to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) side; and, as they stood at the hotel door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) felt that they had escaped from their lives and duties, escaped from home and friends and run away together with wild and radiant hearts to a new adventure.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had felt proud and happy then, happy that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), proud of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) grace and wifely carriage. An old man was dozing in a great hooded chair in the hall.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lit a candle in the office and went before them to the stairs. They followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in silence, their feet falling in soft thuds on the thickly carpeted stairs.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) mounted the stairs behind the porter, her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) head bowed in the ascent, her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) frail shoulders curved as with a burden, her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) skirt girt tightly about her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) could have flung his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) arms about her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hips and held her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) still, for his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) arms were trembling with desire to seize her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) and only the stress of his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) nails against the palms of his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) hands held the wild impulse of his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) body in check.
<p/>In the silence Gabriel could hear the falling of the molten wax into the tray and the thumping of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) own heart against his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) ribs.
<p/>The porter halted on the stairs to settle his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) guttering candle. They halted, too, on the steps below him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>). The porter led them along a corridor and opened a door.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) unstable candle down on a toilet-table and asked at what hour they were to be called in the morning.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eight,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel. The porter pointed to the tap of the electric-light and began a muttered apology, but Gabriel cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) short.
<p/>'' We don't want any light. We have light enough from the street. And I say,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) added, pointing to the candle, <div class="bookquote">``you might remove that handsome article, like a good man.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The porter took up his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) candle again, but slowly, for he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was surprised by such a novel idea. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) mumbled good-night and went out.
<p/>Gabriel shot the lock to. A ghostly light from the street lamp lay in a long shaft from one window to the door.
<p/>Gabriel threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) overcoat and hat on a couch and crossed the room towards the window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) looked down into the street in order that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) emotion might calm a little.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) turned and leaned against a chest of drawers with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) back to the light. She (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) had taken off her (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) hat and cloak and was standing before a large swinging mirror, unhooking her (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) waist.
<p/>Gabriel paused for a few moments, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>), and then said: <div class="bookquote">``Gretta!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) turned away from the mirror slowly and walked along the shaft of light towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) face looked so serious and weary that the words would not pass Gabriel's lips. No, it was not the moment yet.
<p/>'' You looked tired,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said. '' I am a little,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) answered. '' You don't feel ill or weak?'' <div class="bookquote">``No, tired: that's all.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) went on to the window and stood there, looking out. Gabriel waited again and then, fearing that diffidence was about to conquer him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said abruptly: <div class="bookquote">``By the way, Gretta!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What is it?'' <div class="bookquote">``You know that poor fellow Malins? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said quickly. '' Yes. What about him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)? '' <div class="bookquote">``Well, poor fellow, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s a decent sort of chap, after all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>continued Gabriel in a false voice.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) gave me back that sovereign I lent him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), and I didn't expect it, really. It's a pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) wouldn't keep away from that Browne, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>)'s not a bad fellow, really.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) was trembling now with annoyance. Why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) seem so abstracted? He (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) did not know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) could begin.
<p/>Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) annoyed, too, about something? If she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) would only turn to him (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) or come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) own accord!
<p/>To take her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was would be brutal. No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) must see some ardour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) eyes first. He (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) longed to be master of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) strange mood.
<p/>'' When did you lend him (<font color='blue'><b>Browne</b></font>) the pound? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) asked, after a pause. Gabriel strove to restrain himself from breaking out into brutal language about the sottish Malins and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) pound.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) longed to cry to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) soul, to crush her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) body against his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), to overmaster her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``O, at Christmas, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) opened that little Christmas-card shop in Henry Street.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was in such a fever of rage and desire that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) did not hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) come from the window.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) for an instant, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) strangely. Then, suddenly raising herself on tiptoe and resting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hands lightly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) shoulders, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).
<p/>Gabriel, trembling with delight at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) sudden kiss and at the quaintness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) phrase, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hair and began smoothing it back, scarcely touching it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) fingers.
<p/>'' You are a very generous person, Gabriel,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said. The washing had made it fine and brilliant. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) heart was brimming over with happiness.
<p/>Just when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was wishing for it she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) own accord. Perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) thoughts had been running with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>).
<p/>Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had felt the impetuous desire that was in him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), and then the yielding mood had come upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>). Now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had fallen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) so easily, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) wondered why he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had been so diffident.
<p/>Then, slipping one arm swiftly about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) body and drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said softly: <div class="bookquote">``Gretta, dear, what are you thinking about?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) stood, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) head between his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hands. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) did not answer nor yield wholly to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) arm. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said again, softly: <div class="bookquote">``Tell me what it is, Gretta.
<p/>I think I know what is the matter. Do I know? ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) did not answer at once. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) said in an outburst of tears: <div class="bookquote">``O, I am thinking about that song, The Lass of Aughrim.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) broke loose from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) and ran to the bed and, throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) arms across the bed-rail, hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) face.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) passed in the way of the cheval-glass he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) caught sight of himself in full length, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) broad, well-filled shirt-front, the face whose expression always puzzled him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) saw it in a mirror, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) glimmering gilt-rimmed eyeglasses.
<p/>Gabriel stood stock-still for a moment in astonishment and then followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) halted a few paces from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) and said: <div class="bookquote">``What about the song?
<p/>Why does that make you cry? ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) head from her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) arms and dried her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) eyes with the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) hand like a child.
<p/>A kinder note than he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had intended went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) voice. '' Why, Gretta?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) asked. '' I am thinking about a person long ago who used to sing that song.''
<p/>'' And who was the person long ago? '' asked Gabriel, smiling. '' It was a person I used to know in Galway when I was living with my grandmother,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) said.
<p/>A dull anger began to gather again at the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) mind and the dull fires of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) lust began to glow angrily in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) veins.
<p/>The smile passed away from Gabriel's face. '' Someone you were in love with? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) asked ironically. '' It was a young boy I used to know,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``named Michael Furey.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Furey</b></font>) used to sing that song, The Lass of Aughrim. He (<font color='blue'><b>Furey</b></font>) was very delicate. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Gabriel was silent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) did not wish her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was interested in this delicate boy.
<p/>'' I can see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) so plainly,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) said, after a moment. '' Such eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had: big, dark eyes!
<p/>And such an expression in them--an expression!'' <div class="bookquote">``O, then, you are in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)</div>said Gabriel. '' I used to go out walking with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>),'' she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``when I was in Galway.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>A thought flew across Gabriel's mind. '' Perhaps that was why you wanted to go to Galway with that Ivors girl?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said coldly. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) and asked in surprise: <div class="bookquote">``What for?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes made Gabriel feel awkward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) shoulders and said: <div class="bookquote">``How do I know?
<p/>To see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), perhaps. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) along the shaft of light towards the window in silence. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) is dead,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said at length. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) died when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was only seventeen. Isn't it a terrible thing to die so young as that?''
<p/>Gabriel felt humiliated by the failure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) irony and by the evocation of this figure from the dead, a boy in the gasworks.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had been full of memories of their secret life together, full of tenderness and joy and desire, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been comparing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind with another.
<p/>'' What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>)? '' asked Gabriel, still ironically. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was in the gasworks,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said. A shameful consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) own person assailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) saw himself as a ludicrous figure, acting as a pennyboy for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) aunts, a nervous, well-meaning sentimentalist, orating to vulgarians and idealising his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) own clownish lusts, the pitiable fatuous fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had caught a glimpse of in the mirror.
<p/>Instinctively he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) back more to the light lest she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might see the shame that burned upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) forehead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) tried to keep up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) tone of cold interrogation, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) voice when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) spoke was humble and indifferent.
<p/>'' I suppose you were in love with this Michael Furey, Gretta,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Furey</b></font>) said. '' I was great with him (<font color='blue'><b>Furey</b></font>) at that time,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) said.
<p/>Gabriel, feeling now how vain it would be to try to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had purposed, caressed one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) hands and said, also sadly:
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) voice was veiled and sad. <div class="bookquote">``And what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) die of so young, Gretta? Consumption, was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) died for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) answered.
<p/>A vague terror seized Gabriel at this answer, as if, at that hour when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had hoped to triumph, some impalpable and vindictive being was coming against him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>), gathering forces against him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) in its vague world.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) shook himself free of it with an effort of reason and continued to caress her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) did not question her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) again, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) of herself.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) hand was warm and moist: it did not respond to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) touch, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) continued to caress it just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had caressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) first letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) that spring morning.
<p/>It was in the winter,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Gretta</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``about the beginning of the winter when I was going to leave my grandmother's and come up here to the convent.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was ill at the time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) lodgings in Galway and wouldn't be let out, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) people in Oughterard were written to.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was in decline, they said, or something like that. I never knew rightly. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) paused for a moment and sighed.
<p/>'' Poor fellow,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) said. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was very fond of me and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was such a gentle boy. We used to go out together, walking, you know, Gabriel, like the way they do in the country.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was going to study singing only for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) health. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had a very good voice, poor Michael Furey.'' '' Well; and then?'' asked Gabriel.
<p/>And then when it came to the time for me to leave Galway and come up to the convent he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was much worse
<p/>so I wrote him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) a letter saying I was going up to Dublin and would be back in the summer, and hoping he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) would be better then.
<p/>'' and I wouldn't be let see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) paused for a moment to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) voice under control, and then went on:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then the night before I left, I was in my grandmother's house in Nuns' Island, packing up, and I heard gravel thrown up against the window.
<p/>The window was so wet I couldn't see, so I ran downstairs as I was and slipped out the back into the garden
<p/>and there was the poor fellow at the end of the garden, shivering.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>'' And did you not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to go back?'' asked Gabriel.
<p/>'' I implored of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) to go home at once and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) would get his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) death in the rain.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) did not want to live. I can see his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) eyes as well as well! He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was standing at the end of the wall where there was a tree.''
<p/>And when I was only a week in the convent he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) died and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was buried in Oughterard, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) people came from.
<p/>'' And did he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) go home?'' asked Gabriel. '' Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) went home. O, the day I heard that, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was dead!''
<p/>Gabriel held her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hand for a moment longer, irresolutely, and then, shy of intruding on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) grief, let it fall gently and walked quietly to the window.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) stopped, choking with sobs, and, overcome by emotion, flung herself face downward on the bed, sobbing in the quilt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was fast asleep.
<p/>Gabriel, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) elbow, looked for a few moments unresentfully on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) tangled hair and half-open mouth, listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) deep-drawn breath.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had had that romance in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) life: a man had died for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) sake. It hardly pained him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now to think how poor a part he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) husband, had played in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) life.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) curious eyes rested long upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) face and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) hair: and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) thought of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) must have been then, in that time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) first girlish beauty, a strange, friendly pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) entered his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) soul.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) did not like to say even to himself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) face was no longer beautiful, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knew that it was no longer the face for which Michael Furey had braved death.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Furey</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) slept, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Furey</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had never lived together as man and wife. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had not told him (<font color='blue'><b>Furey</b></font>) all the story.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Furey</b></font>) eyes moved to the chair over which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had thrown some of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) clothes. A petticoat string dangled to the floor.
<p/>One boot stood upright, its limp upper fallen down: the fellow of it lay upon its side. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wondered at his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) riot of emotions of an hour before.
<p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) aunt's supper, from his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own foolish speech, from the wine and dancing, the merry-making when saying good-night in the hall, the pleasure of the walk along the river in the snow.
<p/>From what had it proceeded? Poor Aunt Julia! She (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>), too, would soon be a shade with the shade of Patrick Morkan and his (<font color='blue'><b>Morkan</b></font>) horse.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morkan</b></font>) had caught that haggard look upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) face for a moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) was singing Arrayed for the Bridal. Soon, perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morkan</b></font>) would be sitting in that same drawing-room, dressed in black, his (<font color='blue'><b>Morkan</b></font>) silk hat on his (<font color='blue'><b>Morkan</b></font>) knees.
<p/>The blinds would be drawn down and Aunt Kate would be sitting beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Morkan</b></font>), crying and blowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Kate</b></font>) nose and telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Morkan</b></font>) how Julia had died.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morkan</b></font>) would cast about in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morkan</b></font>) mind for some words that might console her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>), and would find only lame and useless ones.
<p/>Yes, yes: that would happen very soon. The air of the room chilled his (<font color='blue'><b>Morkan</b></font>) shoulders. He (<font color='blue'><b>Morkan</b></font>) stretched himself cautiously along under the sheets and lay down beside his (<font color='blue'><b>Morkan</b></font>) wife.
<p/>Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morkan</b></font>) thought of how she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) who lay beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Morkan</b></font>) had locked in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart for so many years that image of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lover's eyes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morkan</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Morkan</b></font>) did not wish to live.
<p/>One by one, they were all becoming shades. Generous tears filled Gabriel's eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) had never felt like that himself towards any woman, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) knew that such a feeling must be love.
<p/>The tears gathered more thickly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) eyes and in the partial darkness he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) imagined he (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) saw the form of a young man standing under a dripping tree.
<p/>Other forms were near. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) soul had approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) was conscious of, but could not apprehend, their wayward and flickering existence.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) own identity was fading out into a grey impalpable world: the solid world itself, which these dead had one time reared and lived in, was dissolving and dwindling.
<p/>A few light taps upon the pane made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) turn to the window. It had begun to snow again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) watched sleepily the flakes, silver and dark, falling obliquely against the lamplight.
<p/>The time had come for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) to set out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gabriel</b></font>) journey westward. Yes, the newspapers were right: snow was general all over Ireland.
<p/>It was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves.
<p/>It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Shannon</b></font>) soul swooned slowly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Shannon</b></font>) heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.
