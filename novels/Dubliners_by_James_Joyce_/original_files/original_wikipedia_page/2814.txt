Dubliners is collection of fifteen short stories by James Joyce, first published in .
They form naturalistic depiction of Irish middle class life in and around Dublin in the early years of the century.
The stories were written when Irish nationalism was at its peak, and search for national identity and purpose was raging; at crossroads of history and culture, Ireland was jolted by various converging ideas and influences.
They centre on Joyce idea of an epiphany: moment where character experiences life changing self understanding or illumination, and the idea of paralysis where Joyce felt Irish nationalism stagnated cultural progression, placing Dublin at the heart of this regressive movement.
Many of the characters in Dubliners later appear in minor roles in Joyce novel Ulysses.
The initial stories in the collection are narrated by child protagonists, and as the stories continue, they deal with the lives and concerns of progressively older people.
This is in line with Joyce tripartite division of the collection into childhood, adolescence and maturity.
Between when Joyce first sent manuscript to publisher, and when the book was finally published, Joyce submitted the book times to total of publishers.
The book publishing history is harrowing tale of persistence in the face of frustration.
The London house of Grant Richards agreed to publish it in .
Its printer, however, refused to set one of the stories ("Two Gallants"), and Richards then began to press Joyce to remove number of other passages that he claimed the printer also refused to set.
Joyce protested, but eventually did agree to some of the requested changes.
Richards eventually backed out of the deal.
Joyce thereupon resubmitted the manuscript to other publishers, and about three years later he found willing candidate in Maunsel Roberts of Dublin.
Yet, similar controversy developed and Maunsel too refused to publish it, even threatening to sue Joyce for printing costs already incurred.
Joyce offered to pay the printing costs himself if the sheets were turned over to him and he was allowed to complete the job elsewhere and distribute the book, but when Joyce arrived at the printers they refused to surrender the sheets.
They burned them the next day.
Joyce managed to save one copy, which he obtained "by ruse".
He then returned to submitting the manuscript to other publishers, and in Grant Richards once again agreed to publish the book, using the page proofs saved from Maunsel as copy.
The Sisters" After the priest Father Flynn dies, young boy who was close to him and his family deals with his death superficially.
An Encounter" Two schoolboys playing truant encounter middle aged man.
Araby" A boy falls in love with the sister of his friend, but fails in his quest to buy her worthy gift from the Araby bazaar.
Eveline" A young woman weighs her decision to flee Ireland with sailor.
After the Race" College student Jimmy Doyle tries to fit in with his wealthy friends.
Two Gallants" Two con men, Lenehan and Corley, find maid who is willing to steal from her employer.
The Boarding House" Mrs Mooney successfully manoeuvres her daughter Polly into an upwardly mobile marriage with her lodger Mr Doran.
A Little Cloud" Little Chandler dinner with his old friend Ignatius Gallaher casts fresh light on his own failed literary dreams.
The story also reflects on Chandler mood upon realising that his baby son has replaced him as the centre of his wife affections.
Counterparts" Farrington, lumbering alcoholic scrivener, takes out his frustration in pubs and on his son Tom.
Clay" The old maid Maria, laundress, celebrates Halloween with her former foster child Joe Donnelly and his family.
A Painful Case" Mr Duffy rebuffs Mrs Sinico, then, four years later, realises that he has condemned her to loneliness and death.
Ivy Day in the Committee Room" Minor politicians fail to live up to the memory of Charles Stewart Parnell.
A Mother" Mrs Kearney tries to win place of pride for her daughter, Kathleen, in the Irish cultural movement, by starring her in series of concerts, but ultimately fails.
Grace" After Mr Kernan injures himself falling down the stairs in bar, his friends try to reform him through Catholicism.
The Dead" Gabriel Conroy attends party, and later, as he speaks with his wife, has an epiphany about the nature of life and death.
At words this story has also been classified as novella.
The Dead was adapted into film by John Huston, written for the screen by his son Tony and starring his daughter Anjelica as Mrs. Conroy.
When discussing Joyce Dubliners, there are two types of critics that are often at the forefront of the conversation: the "Realists" and the "Symbolists".
The Realists view Dubliners as the most simple of Joyce works, which often causes them to disregard the revolutionary nature of the work.
The symbolists instead neglect the rebellious meanings behind Joyce symbols.
While some choose only one side to argue, others believe that Dubliners completely defies any form of characterization.
Without any clear evidence of thematic unity, logic of plot, or closure, Joyce prevents any conclusive critical analysis.
As Sonja Bašić argues, the book "should be seen not just as realist/naturalist masterpiece, but as significant stepping stone integrated into the modernist structure of Joyce mature work.
It has been argued that the narrators in Dubliners rarely mediate, which means that there are limited descriptions of their thoughts and emotions, practice said to accompany narratorial invisibility where the narrator sees instead of tells.
While some point to Joyce use of free indirect discourse as way to understand his characters, he often obscures the reliability of his characters in way that would make any kind of analysis very difficult.
His characters' personalities can only be observed because they are not explicitly told.
The collection progresses chronologically, beginning with stories of youth and progressing in age to culminate in The Dead.
Emphasis is laid upon the specific geographic details of Dublin, for example, road names and buildings feature extensively.
Hugh Leonard adapted six stories as Dublin One which was staged at the Gate Theatre, Dublin, in .
John Huston film production of "The Dead" was released in .
In October BBC Radio broadcast dramatisations by various writers of "A Painful Case", "After the Race", "Two Gallants", "The Boarding House", "A Little Cloud", and "Counterparts".
The series ended with dramatization of "The Dead", which was first broadcast in under the title 'Distant Music'.
These were accompanied by nighttime abridged readings, starting with "Ivy Day in the Committee Room" (in two parts, read by T. P. McKenna), followed by "The Sisters", "An Encounter", "Araby", "Eveline", and "Clay", all read by Barry McGovern.
In short film adaptation of "Araby" was produced and directed by Dennis Courtney.

The Sisters" is short story by James Joyce, the first of series of short stories called Dubliners.
Originally published in the Irish Homestead on August "The Sisters" was Joyce first published work of fiction.
Joyce later revised the story and had it, along with the rest of the series, published in book form in .
Eliza Flynn, sister of James Flynn
Nannie Flynn, sister of James Flynn
The Sisters″ gives portrait of the relationship between nameless boy and the infirm priest Father Flynn.
The priest who has been relieved of his priestly duties has acted as mentor for the boy in the clerical duties of Catholic priest.
The story starts with the boy contemplating Father Flynn illness and impending death.
He is fascinated with interpreting signs and symbols, and their meaning.
Later, while the boy eats his dinner, his aunt, uncle, and old Cotter have conversation in which the boy is informed that the priest has died.
The conversation focuses on the priest and his relationship with the boy.
That night the boy is haunted by images of the priest.
The next day the boy goes to look at the announcement that the priest has died, and then wanders about, further puzzling about his dream and about his relationship with the priest.
That night the boy and his aunt go to the house of mourning.
They view the corpse with Nannie, and then they sit with the sisters Eliza and Nannie.
They are offered food and drink, and then Eliza and the aunt carry on conversation that reveals that Father Flynn had apparently suffered mental breakdown after accidentally breaking chalice.
In summer of George Russell of the editorial department of the weekly paper The Irish Homestead wrote Joyce letter in regards to section of the journal called "Our Weekly Story":
Look at the story in this paper The Irish Homestead.
Could you write anything simple, rural?, livemaking?, pathos?, which could be inserted so as not to shock the readers.
If you could furnish short story about words suitable for insertion the editor will pay £.
It is easily earned money if you can write fluently and don't mind playing to the common understanding and liking for once in way.
You can sign it any name you like as pseudonym.
Joyce took the offer, and ″The Sisters″ was published on August using the pseudonym Stephen Dædalus, name given to one of Joyce semi autobiographical literary characters in his later novels Portrait of the Artist as Young Man and Ulysses.
The Sisters″ was the start of series called Dubliners that he hoped the Homestead would continue to publish.
In fact, Joyce would write two more stories for the Homestead, ″Eveline″ and ″After the Race,″ before complaints stopped the paper from publishing any more of his stories.
Joyce, nevertheless, continued to add more stories to the collection.
But, he had great difficulty getting Dubliners published, and it wasn't until that the first edition of the book came out.
During that decade, ″The Sisters″ went through number of revisions.
The two published versions have essentially the same plot.
The diction, however, was transformed from romantic style to wholly modernist text.
The Homestead version spelled much out for the reader.
In the version, on the other hand, Joyce dropped the non essential commentary leaving the facts to speak for themselves, style Joyce called "scrupulous meanness.
Readers are left to interpret and feel the bare facts for themselves.
The style demands greater engagement by the reader who must now provide more interpretation of the facts.
Other changes were made to characterisation and relationships.
In particular, Joyce severely strengthened the relationship between the priest and the boy making it stand out as memorable feature of the story.
The Sisters" has been subject of scholarly debate, mostly in regards to the priest illness.
One analysis of Father Flynn illness throughout the second version of the story shows that Joyce deliberately implied that Father Flynn had central nervous system syphilis.
Joyce was interested and qualified enough in medicine to be able to describe syphilitic and had definite reasons for doing so.
The syphilitic nature of Father Flynn illness is apparent in the author use of paralysis, which was often used synonymously with paresis (general paralysis of the insane) when Joyce began his revisions in .
The priest having suffered from sexually transmitted infection would help account for the adult society negative opinion and disdain for him.
In February a short film adaptation of The Sisters was written directed by Matthew Eberle

An Encounter"AuthorJames JoyceCountryIrelandLanguageEnglishGenre(s)short storyPublished inDublinersPublication typeCollectionMedia typePrintPublication datePreceded by"The Sisters"Followed by"Araby"
An Encounter" is short story by James Joyce.
It is second in collection of Joyce short stories called Dubliners.
The story involves boy the narrator and his friend Mahony taking day off from school and going to the shore, to seek adventure in their otherwise dull lives.
As the narrator says, "The mimic warfare of the evening became at last as wearisome to me as the routine of school in the morning because wanted real adventures to happen to myself.
But real adventures, reflected, do not happen to people who remain at home: they must be sought abroad."
The episode revolves around their trip and the people that they see.
There are enormous social events that the boys witness and the narrator, in an act of maturity, seems to at least be able to notice the situations.
For example, the boys are mistaken for Protestants by some local children.
The narrator also notices that many of the children are "ragged" and extremely poor.
Near the end of their day, the boys are approached by an older man who gives them an odd feeling.
Previously, it seems to the reader that the man had been izing them up' and then began to talk of mundane subjects, such as Sir Walter Scott and young sweethearts.
At one point, the man excuses himself and it is implied that he touches himself before returning to the boys.
He then begins drawn out monologue on the subject of whipping and other such corporal punishments.
Deeply unsettled, the narrator looks to his friend Mahony for comfort, although he admits to harbouring negative feelings about him, as is evident from the final sentence of the story, in which the narrator of the story says that he has always despised him (i.e.
There is no textual proof that the man does in fact masturbate: all is left to the reader to judge an example of Joyce use of Gnomon, an evasive practice often encountered in Joyce writing, most succinctly expounded in Stephen remark in Portrait of the Artist as Young Man that "absence is the highest form of presence".
Absence is the highest form of presence' was in fact jibe directed at Joyce by students at St. Stephens College, Dublin due to speech in which he said that 'Death is the highest form of life'.
This phrase was used both by Joyce himself and later by 'The Cap' in Ulysses, appearing as 'eath is the highest form of life.
p. in an argument with Stephen Dedalus.
The tale depicts many aspects of Dublin society at the time antagonism and violence between Catholic and Protestant communities, Irish poverty, lecherous old men, foreigners and the schooling of boys.
The boys encounter all these in this short story, giving us broad view of Dublin itself.
An Encounter From the book Dubliners.
Araby" is short story by James Joyce published in his collection Dubliners.
Through first person narration, the reader is immersed at the start of the story in the drab life that people live on North Richmond Street, which seems to be illuminated only by the verve and imagination of the children who, despite the growing darkness that comes during the winter months, insist on playing "until bodies glowed."
Even though the conditions of this neighbourhood leave much to be desired, the children play is infused with their almost magical way of perceiving the world, which the narrator dutifully conveys to the reader:
Our shouts echoed in the silent street.
The career of our play brought us through the dark muddy lanes behind the houses where we ran the gauntlet of the rough tribes from the cottages, to the back doors of the dark dripping gardens where odours arose from the ashpits, to the dark odorous stables where coachman smoothed and combed the horse or shook music from the buckled harness.
But though these boys "career" around the neighbourhood in very childlike way, they are also aware of and interested in the adult world, as represented by their spying on the narrator uncle as he comes home from work and, more importantly, on Mangan sister, whose dress “swung as she moved” and whose “soft rope of hair tossed from side to side.” These boys are on the brink of sexual awareness and, awed by the mystery of the opposite sex, are hungry for knowledge.
On one rainy evening, the boy secludes himself in soundless, dark drawing room and gives his feelings for her full release: "I pressed the palms of my hands together until they trembled, murmuring: love!
This scene is the culmination of the narrator increasingly romantic idealization of Mangan sister.
By the time he actually speaks to her, he has built up such an unrealistic idea of her that he can barely put sentences together: “When she addressed the first words to me was so confused that did not know what to answer.
She asked me if was going to Araby.
I forget whether answered yes or no.” But the narrator recovers splendidly: when Mangan sister dolefully states that she will not be able to go to Araby, he gallantly offers to bring something back for her.
The narrator now cannot wait to go to the Araby bazaar and procure for his beloved some grand gift that will endear him to her.
And though his aunt frets, hoping that it is not “some Freemason affair,” and though his uncle, perhaps intoxicated, perhaps stingy, arrives so late from work and equivocates so much that he almost keeps the narrator from being able to go, the intrepid yet frustrated narrator heads out of the house, tightly clenching florin, in spite of the late hour, toward the bazaar.
But the Araby market turns out not to be the most fantastic place he had hoped it would be.
It is late; most of the stalls are closed.
The only sound is "the fall of the coins" as men count their money.
Worst of all, however, is the vision of sexuality—of his future—that he receives when he stops at one of the few remaining open stalls.
The young woman minding the stall is engaged in conversation with two young men.
Though he is potentially customer, she only grudgingly and briefly waits on him before returning to her frivolous conversation.
His idealized vision of Araby is destroyed, along with his idealized vision of Mangan sister—and of love.
With shame and anger rising within him, he is alone in Araby.
Araby" touches on great number of themes:
the life of the mind versus poverty (both physical and intellectual)
the Catholic Church influence to make Dublin place of asceticism where desire and sensuality are seen as immoral
the pain that often comes when one encounters love in reality instead of its elevated form
These themes build on one another entirely through the thoughts of the young boy, who is portrayed by the first person narrator, who writes from memory.
Araby" contains many themes and traits common to Joyce in general and Dubliners in particular.
As with many of the stories in the collection, "Araby" involves character going on journey, the end result of which is fruitless, and ends with the character going back to where he came from.
Eveline" is just one other story in Dubliners to feature circular journey in this manner.
Also, the narrator lives with his aunt and uncle, although his uncle appears to be portrait of Joyce father, and may be seen as prototype for Simon Dedalus of Portrait of the Artist as Young Man and Ulysses.
The scorn the narrator has for his uncle is certainly consistent with the scorn Joyce showed for his father, and the lack of "good" parents is pertinent.
In "The Structure of Araby," Jerome Mandel notes the shared plot archetypes between “Araby” and traditional medieval romantic literature, positing that Joyce deliberately “structured with rigorous precision upon paradigm of medieval romance.”
Among later writers influenced by "Araby" was John Updike, whose oft anthologized short story, "A&P", is American reimagining of Joyce tale of young man, lately the wiser for his frustrating infatuation with beautiful but inaccessible girl.
Her allure has excited him into confusing his emergent sexual impulses for those of honor and chivalry, and brought about disillusionment and loss of innocence.
In the Austin, Texas based alternative rock group The Reivers (band) released their Translate Slowly album whose lead track "Araby" was literary adaptation of the story.
In short film adaptation of "Araby" was produced and directed by Dennis Courtney with screenplay by Joseph Bierman.
A Brazilian film with the same name by João Dumans and Affonso Uchoa was by the short story
Eveline" is short story by the Irish writer James Joyce.
It was first published in by the journal Irish Homestead and later featured in his collection of short stories Dubliners.
A young woman, Eveline, of about nineteen years of age sits by her window, waiting to leave home.
She muses on the aspects of her life that are driving her away, while "in her nostrils was the odor of dusty cretonne".
Her mother has died as has her older brother Ernest.
Her remaining brother, Harry, is on the road "in the church decorating business".
She fears that her father will beat her as he used to beat her brothers and she has little loyalty for her sales job.
She has fallen for sailor named Frank who promises to take her with him to Buenos Aires.
Before leaving to meet Frank, she hears an organ grinder outside, which reminds her of melody that played on an organ on the day her mother died and the promise she made to her mother to look after the home.
At the dock where she and Frank are ready to embark on ship together, Eveline is deeply conflicted and makes the painful decision not to leave with him.
Nonetheless, her face registers no emotion at all.
Like other tales in Dubliners, such as "Araby", "Eveline" features circular journey, where character decides to go back to where their journey began and where the result of their journey is disappointment and reluctance to travel.
After the Race" is short story by James Joyce published in his collection Dubliners.
As many flashy cars drive toward Dublin, crowds gather and cheer.
A race has just finished, and though the French have placed second and third after the German–Belgian team, the local sightseers loudly support them.
Jimmy Doyle rides in one of the cars with his wealthy French friend, Charles Ségouin, whom he met while studying at Cambridge.
Two other men ride with them as well: Ségouin’s Canadian cousin, André Rivière, and Hungarian pianist, Villona.
Driving back into Dublin, the young men rejoice about the victory, and Jimmy enjoys the prestige of the ride.
He fondly thinks about his recent investment in Ségouin’s motor company business venture, financial backing that his father, successful butcher, approves and supports.
Jimmy savors the notoriety of being surrounded by and seen with such glamorous company, and in such luxurious car.
Ségouin drops Jimmy and Villona off in Dublin so they can return to Jimmy’s home, where Villona is staying, to change into formal dress for dinner at Ségouin’s hotel.
Jimmy’s proud parents dote on their smartly dressed and well connected son.
At the dinner, the reunited party joins an Englishman, Routh, and conversation energetically moves from music to cars to politics, under the direction of Ségouin.
Jimmy, turning to Irish–English relations, rouses an angry response from Routh, but Ségouin expertly snuffs any potential for argument with toast.
After the meal, the young men stroll through Dublin and run into another acquaintance, an American named Farley, who invites them to his yacht.
The party grows merrier, and they sing French marching song as they make their way to the harbor.
Once on board, the men proceed to dance and drink as Villona plays the piano.
Jimmy makes speech that his companions loudly applaud, and then the men settle down to play cards.
Drunk and giddy, Jimmy plays game after game, losing more and more money.
He yearns for the playing to stop, but goes along nevertheless.
A final game leaves Routh the champion.
Even as the biggest loser alongside Farley, Jimmy’s spirits never dwindle.
He knows he will feel remorse the next day, but assures himself of his happiness just as Villona opens the cabin door and announces that daybreak has come.
At the beginning of the story, before the characters are introduced, the cars speed through Inchicore, and the writer own voice remarks that "through this channel of poverty and inaction the Continent sped its wealth and industry" and the Irish onlookers raise "the cheer of the gratefully oppressed".
Motor cars at the early were generally considered luxury item, here serving as the symbol of the richer, wider world beyond the confines of backward Ireland.
The protagonist Jimmy Doyle seeks to enter this wider cosmopolitan society and carve an equal place for himself, but this ends in failure: he finds himself out of his depth, becomes drunk and unable to keep track of the card game, and ends up losing heavily to the Englishman, Routh, whom he earlier challenged.
The story can thus be seen as skeptical about the aspirations of Irish Nationalism to make an independent Ireland the equal of other countries.
Two Gallants" is short story by James Joyce published in his collection Dubliners.
It tells the story of two Irishmen who are frustrated with their lack of achievement in life and rely on the exploitation of others to live.
Joyce considered the story to be one of the most important in Dubliners.
The London house of Grant Richards agreed to publish Dubliners in but there were printing complications and concerns of obscenity.
One of the stories with passages in question was “Two Gallants.” Joyce questions Richard reluctance to publish by asking "Is it the small gold coin in the former story or the code of honour which the two gallants live by which shocks him?
In letter to Grant Richards, Joyce voiced his fondness of the story saying “to omit the story from the book would really be disastrous.
It is one of the most important stories in the book.
I would rather sacrifice five of the other stories (which could name) than this one.” Joyce redacted some words from the end product, but the story was kept in the collection which was published by Richards nine years after Joyce originally submitted it in .
In the evening, young man named Corley is walking with his friend Lenehan and telling him about woman he has seduced.
A rendezvous has been arranged with the woman and Corley, during which Lenehan wanders around Dublin before stopping at refreshment house for supper of peas and bottle of brown ale.
During his solitude, Lenehan contemplates his current state; he is at the age of thirty one, and is thoroughly unsatisfied with his life of leeching and "chasing the devil by his tail."
He dreams of settling down with "simple minded" woman, who could provide him with money.
After eating, Lenehan wanders around the streets aimlessly, hoping Corley will meet him at the previously arranged time.
Corley presents him with gold coin from the woman.
The reader is never told how the woman acquired it, but it is implied that she either stole it from her employer on his behalf, or that it is the sum of her savings.
This contrasts with Corley descriptions of past relationships he had had, in which he spent money on women.
Together, Lenehan and Corley walk off with the coin.
Two Gallants is arguably combination of naturalism, realism, and modernism.
Naturalism portrays realistic events in detached way, like realism, but there is an ideology of determinism.
Corley and Lenehan are product of their environment and circumstances.
But from this naturalistic angle they are morally exempt, and it is suggested that it is kind of ironic naturalism on Joyce’s part as moral critique of the Irish resigning to their situation.
The way in which Joyce resists the conventional narrative arc and leaves the stories without clear conclusions, without clear meanings given to anything, one can see the modernist traits.
The ambiguity about what it is that Corley must pull off, and the half said things running through the dialogue, and the many symbols and allusions, make the text job to decipher, in true modernist style.
Some suggested themes are betrayal Corley is betrayed by society in the lack of opportunities for the middle and lower class, and so he becomes the betrayer.
Some critics propose symbolism for religious betrayal, that of Judas betraying Christ, but an inversion.
The many orbs and circles in the text allude to the halo of Christ.
The symbolism supports the socio political betrayal and the religious betrayal simultaneously.
There is also the reading of the betrayal or contamination of Irish romantic ideals of the past.
The harp is symbol of Irish romanticism, and links with the idea of gallantry, which we are prepared for by the title but meet the opposite of in the two main characters.
A possible reading is that Corley and Lenehan are the corrupted idea of chivalry, or gallantry.
The harp stands for the uncorrupted ideal, but her cover lies around her knees, like violated woman and the servant girl Corley is about to swindle.
The harp is weary of the eyes of strangers and her master’s hands, suggesting molestation and exploitation put on display.
The moon slowly being covered by rain clouds can also be read as the romantic ideal disappearing.
It is replaced at the end with material gain.
Corley holds up the coin like knight who has found the grail, and the contrast to reality emphasizes the degeneration of morals.
The Boarding House" is short story by James Joyce published in his collection Dubliners.
Mrs. Mooney, separated from her husband, butcher who descended into alcoholism, runs boarding house for working men.
Her daughter Polly entertains the boarders by singing and flirting with them.
Mrs. Mooney learns that her daughter is having an affair with Mr. Doran, man in his mid thirties who has worked in Catholic wine merchant’s office for many years.
On Sunday nights, Polly would sing with the various guests in the boarding house.
It is noted that she sings "I'm naughty girl," which Zack Bowen suggests foreshadows her affair with Mr.
Mrs. Mooney bides her time before she intervenes, strongly implying that she is deliberately trying to trap Mr. Doran.
After much background, the climax of the story commences on warm Sunday morning.
Mrs. Mooney intends to talk to Mr. Doran and demand that he marry Polly or risk open disclosure.
The narration then shifts to Doran’s point of view as he nervously contemplates losing his job due to the affair and bemoans the girl’s lower class background and vulgarities of speech.
After Polly enters in an agitated state, we learn through Doran’s memories that she initiated the relationship.
After Doran leaves the room, Polly seems content, suggesting that she was putting on show of anguish for his sake.
The story closes with Mrs. Mooney calling Polly down so that Mr. Doran can speak to her.

A Little Cloud" is short story in Dubliners, by James Joyce.
In the short story "A Little Cloud" by James Joyce, the protagonist, Little Chandler, begins the narrative at his office job in Dublin.
He excitedly thinks about his old friend Ignatius Gallaher who he is to meet at bar upon leaving work.
Gallaher has become moderately successful journalist abroad in England and when Chandler arrives at the bar, he sees that this position has had an influence on his friend.
After sharing drinks and cigars, the two men separate and Chandler heads home thinking about his life compared to Gallaher.
This leads him down largely negative train of thought which climaxes when he returns home.
He sees, but cannot console his crying infant and the contempt his wife holds for him is clear enough.
This makes Chandler believe that he has, to an extent, wasted his life and he succumbs to sorrow and remorse.
This story has often been read to represent aspects of the political struggle between England and Ireland at the time as well.
The story follows Thomas Chandler, or "Little Chandler" as he is known, through portion of his day.
The story drops the reader into Little Chandler life when he is at work, where he cannot focus because he is preoccupied with the thought of visit later that day.
He anxiously awaits this visit with his old friend Ignatius Gallaher.
Gallaher is now "brilliant figure" in the London Press and Little Chandler has not seen him in eight years.
As Little Chandler thinks about his old friend and the success that has come to him, he begins to reflect upon his own life.
This reflection gives the reader insight to Little Chandler character.
The reader sees Little Chandler as mere observer of life, reluctant character.
He is timid, because he enjoys poetry yet is too "shy" to read it to his wife.
Little Chandler likes to think that he himself could have been writer if only he had put his mind to it.
All of the "different moods and impressions he wished to express in verse" could still be achieved if he could just express himself.
But as much as Little Chandler covers up his true feelings with these thoughts that seem to "comfort" him, the reader can see past this.
These feelings are more clearly exposed to the reader in the bar where Little Chandler actually meets Gallaher.
Here, Gallaher tells enchanting stories of his vast traveling.
His life is the exact opposite of Little Chandler and Little Chandler begins to feel that his wife is holding him back from success as result of Gallaher glorification of his travels and freedoms.
Without his wife, without his little boy, he would be free to prosper.
Deep envy sets into Little Chandler.
It seems as though the more they drink, and the longer they talk, the more inferior Chandler feels.
Still, he tries to hide his envy of Gallaher life by saying how one day Gallaher will get married and start family too.
Joyce shifts the scene to Little Chandler home.
We find Little Chandler with his child in his arms.
He is sitting at table looking at picture of his wife, Annie.
He looks into her eyes searching for answers to his now confused state of mind.
He sees pretty girl, but he can see no life in her, and he compares her unfavourably to the rich, exotic women Gallaher says are available to him.
He wonders why he married Annie.
He then opens book of Byron poetry and begins to read until the child begins to cry and Little Chandler finds he cannot comfort him.
Little Chandler snaps at his son.
The frightened baby cries harder and harder until Annie comes.
Through her interaction with Little Chandler and the child, it becomes apparent that Little Chandler is not her main priority.
All feelings of hope that existed at the beginning of the day are now gone.
It is at this moment that Little Chandler reaches deep moment of recognition.
He finally sees the truth that the reader has known all along.
His own reluctance is the only thing responsible for his feelings of incompleteness, and he can now only blame himself.
Tears come to Little Chandler eyes, and the story is cut off.
And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold, there ariseth little cloud out of the sea, like man hand.
And he said, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee down that the rain stop thee not.
I Kings King James Version (KJV)
Harold Mosher has examined Little Cloud to show that in the rest of the Dubliners, Joyce uses and perhaps abuses both repetition and cliché in order to give the writing feel of insignificance.
He points out that there is legitimate lack of action in many of the stories, certainly in "A Little Cloud", and this "content of lack" is mirrored by the language Joyce used.
Mosher believes that the talking about nothing, in the way that many Joyce characters do, is actually rather important.
He argues that in terms of the language, this style actually portrays an abundance of creativity and quality, rather than lack of fresh thought implied by the cliché nature of the writing.
Thematically he believes that this is important in an ironic way, because though it shows creativity on the part of Joyce, it shows little on the part of Chandler.
He thinks and speaks in this way, because he, as he says in the end to Annie, "I Couldn’t... didn't do anything.
Thomas O'Grady has argued that the somewhat ambiguous title "A Little Cloud" can be attributed to William Blake "Infant Sorrow."
He points out that Blake was an influential artist for Joyce and that Joyce gave lecture on Blake once.
O'Grady believes that this connection is logical, because it lends structural and thematic significance to the title.
This story is Little Chandler "song of experience" according to O'Grady, because the "infant hope" carried by his child is overwhelmed with the sorrow and remorse that Chandler feels.
Terence Brown meanwhile has suggested that the title may be an allusion to the Biblical tale of Elijah and the prophets of Baal and more particularly to Kings :.
Counterparts" is short story by James Joyce published in his collection Dubliners.
The story recounts an evening in the life of man named Farrington, frequently referred to simply as "the man".
Farrington’s difficulties begin at his clerical job when his boss whom he addresses as "Mr. Alleyne" berates him for not having finished an assignment.
Instead of applying himself immediately to the task, the alcoholic Farrington slips out of the office for quick "g.p."
When Alleyne yells at Farrington again, Farrington replies with an impertinent remark and has to apologize.
We learn that Farrington’s relationship with his superior has never been good one, partly due to Alleyne’s overhearing of Farrington mocking his Ulster accent.
After work, Farrington joins his friends at various pubs, but only after he pawns his watch chain for drinking money.
Farrington’s account of his standing up to his boss earns him some respect.
However, his revelries end in two humiliations: perceived slight by an elegant young woman and defeat in an arm wrestling contest.
Farrington goes home in foul mood to discover that his wife is out at chapel.
He tells his youngest son, Tom, to make dinner but as the child lets the fire in the kitchen go out, Farrington rage explodes and he starts beating the little child with walking stick.
The story ends with Tom pleading for mercy.
For Joyce contemporaneous audience, the term "counterparts" could be expected to suggest (hand written) duplicate copies of documents concerning the office business.
Clay" is short story by James Joyce published in his collection Dubliners.
Maria, an elderly woman with job in rescue mission for wayward women, is looking forward to holiday evening at the house of Joe, whom she nursed when he was boy and of whom she is still very fond.
She departs for Joe after attending tea service with her fellow laundresses, stopping to buy cakes for the Halloween party on the way.
At the bakery, Maria is somewhat teased by the clerk, who asks whether she wishes to buy wedding cake, mirroring similar joke that was made at the earlier tea.
On tram, Maria has bashful encounter with an elderly and drunken man who chats with her.
She is welcomed warmly at the house by Joe’s family, but she is saddened and ashamed to realize that she has left the plumcake she bought for Joe and his wife on the tram, probably due to "flirting" with the man.
Maria is soon enticed into playing traditional Hallow Eve game with the children in which objects are placed in saucers and blindfolded player has to pick among them.
Each object is supposed to have prophetic significance.
One of the objects in the game is ring, standing for marriage, which Maria failed to get during similar game (in which objects were baked into pieces of barmbrack) back at the laundry.
At Joe, Maria once again misses the ring and instead chooses lump of clay.
Everyone goes quiet, Maria is allowed to choose again, however, and this time fetches the prayer book, indicating life of spiritual vocation (service at convent, suggests Joe wife).
After drinking some wine, Maria sings the aria "I Dreamt That Dwelt in Marble Halls" from the opera The Bohemian Girl by Michael Balfe.
She makes what the text refers to as "a mistake" by singing the first verse twice, but nobody corrects her.
She omits the second verse of the song, this omission is significant as the missing verse imagines suitors such as the ones that Maria has not had in her life:
I dreamt that suitors sought my hand,
And with vows no maiden heart could withstand,
They pledg'd their faith to me.
And dreamt that one of that noble host
Came forth my hand to claim;
But also dreamt, which charm'd me most,
That you lov'd me still the same.
The story ends with description of how Joe has been "very much moved" by her song, so moved that he needs to ask his wife to find the corkscrew for him.
This short story was written in time of religious and political turmoil in Ireland.
At the time that Clay was written there was divide among the Irish between those of the Catholic faith and those of the Protestant faith.
A Painful Case" is short story by Irish author James Joyce, published in his collection Dubliners.
Mr. Duffy, middle aged bank cashier, deliberately lives in an isolated suburb of Dublin.
He is characterized as very meticulous and ordered and has little social contact.
At concert one night, Duffy makes the acquaintance of Mrs. Emily Sinico, married mother.
They start up relationship that is innocent enough to be condoned by Mrs. Sinico’s husband, who believes the two discussions revolve mostly around his daughter and the possibility of relationship between her and Duffy.
The two draw closer together, and one night Mrs. Sinico impulsively takes his hand and presses it to her cheek, but Duffy is not pleased at the development and ends their meetings.
Four years later, he reads that Mrs. Sinico has been struck by train and killed.
The newspaper article, the title of which provides the title of the story, contains an account by her husband, who states that she began drinking two years ago.
The details of the accident suggest that she may have caused her own death.
He reacts at first with revulsion, concluding that some inherent weakness led to her drinking and the accident, but he slowly comes to believe that it was his rejection that condemned her to solitude and death.
He reflects on his own loneliness: "No one wanted him; he was outcast from life feast."
The story ends with Duffy listening to the silence of the surrounding night atop hill overlooking Dublin where he and Sinico used to sit down and talk, where he realizes just how lonely he really is.

Ivy Day in the Committee Room"AuthorJames JoyceCountryIrelandLanguageEnglishGenre(s)short storyPublished inDublinersPublication typeCollectionMedia typePrintPublication datePreceded by"A Painful Case"Followed by"A Mother"
Ivy Day in the Committee Room" is short story by James Joyce published in his collection Dubliners.
Taking place on election day, "Ivy Day in the Committee Room" discusses candidate Richard Tierney as people filter in and out.
Ivy Day refers to the anniversary of Charles Parnell, important Irish figure and nationalist.
In committee room, Mat O'Connor, canvasser for Richard Tierney, candidate in an upcoming municipal election, discusses child rearing with Old Jack, who tries to keep fire going.
Joe Hynes, another canvasser, arrives and needles O’Connor on whether he’s been paid for his work yet.
He proceeds to defend rival candidate Colgan working class background and maintains that Tierney, although Nationalist, will likely present welcome address at the upcoming visit of King Edward VII.
When Hynes points out that it is Ivy Day, commemoration of Charles Stewart Parnell, nostalgic silence fills the room.
Another canvasser, John Henchy, enters and derides Tierney for not having paid him yet.
When Hynes leaves, Henchy voices suspicion that the man is spy for Colgan.
Henchy badmouths another canvasser, Crofton, just before Crofton himself enters with Bantam Lyons.
Crofton had worked for the Conservative candidate until the party withdrew and gave their support to Tierney.
The talk of politics drifts to Charles Stewart Parnell, who has his defenders and detractors in the room.
Hynes returns and is encouraged to read his sentimental poem dedicated to Parnell.
The poem is highly critical of those who betrayed him, including the Roman Catholic Church, and places Parnell among the ancient heroes of Ireland.
All applaud the performance and seem to forget their differences for the moment.
The ideas for both "The Dead" and "Ivy Day" Joyce attributed to Anatole France, although the latter story also owes something to his brother Stanislaus' account of his father at work during Dublin by election three years earlier.
After being rejected by Symon’s publishers, Joyce sent Dubliners (then comprising only twelve stories) to publisher Grant Richards.
It took nearly eight years for Dubliners to get published.
Going back and forth with Richards, who initially agreed to publish his work, Joyce revised and omitted many things in Dubliners to reach an agreement.
However, Richards objected to too many things and eventually simply refused to publish the book.
Ireland has prominent role in Joyce writing.
Having been under the rule of Great Britain since the sixteenth century, longstanding division has always separated the two islands.
Joyce found the city of Dublin especially interesting: “I do not think that any writer has yet presented Dublin to the world.
It has been capital of Europe for thousands of years, it is supposed to be the second city of the British Empire and is nearly three times as big as Venice.”
In "Ivy Day in the Committee Room" Joyce touches on the deep rooted political struggle by noting nationalist Charles Stewart Parnell and his role in Irish politics.
His representation in "Ivy Day" is clear from the title of the story: Ivy Day is the anniversary of the death of Parnell, the "uncrowned king of Ireland".
Parnell wanted to give the Irish people greater role in the management of their own affairs.
Parnell ousting from power served to delay Irish independence.
In "Ivy Day in the Committee Room," the campaigners for Tierney are not campaigning for him to get into office but rather as way for them to earn money.
They acknowledge, however, that “Some of those hillsiders and Fenians are bit too clever if you ask me... Do you know what my private and candid opinion is about some of those little jokers?
I believe half of them are in the pay of the Castle” (i.e.
Fenian” was nickname given to those conspiring in revolutionary movement to free Ireland from Britain, radical nationalist.
The inactivity in “Ivy Day in the Committee Room” serves to show Joyce’s view of Irish nationalism.
The stagnant conversations speak to Ireland’s paralytic nature.
Nothing being accomplished in this story reflects the fact that nothing was being done about obtaining Ireland’s independence.
A common theme throughout "Ivy Day in the Committee Room", and Dubliners as whole, is paralysis.
Not only do the men conversations go nowhere, but they are physically sitting down, paralyzed.
This paralysis extends beyond the room, the lackadaisical characters and the election to Ireland as whole.
When Parnell’s affair with married woman Kitty O’Shea was exposed, his political career ended.
Ireland and Britain were both shocked by the discovery.
After Parnell death, an Irish cultural and political movement was set into motion.
Citizens tried to figure out what it meant to live in Ireland with strong Irish roots.
Ireland split into segregated religious groups–Catholics versus Protestants.
Most Irish were Catholic and wanted independence from Britain.
These were the radicals; the conservatives were in favor of staying under British rule.
This sheds light on the two pillars of cultural nationalism: the Catholic faith and Gaelic heritage leading to people to learn the "Irish” language, Gaelic, renewing sense of cultural nationalism, pride in their country: “The Celtic Revival attempted to produce new Irish culture in the absence of compelling political cohesion after the death of Parnell.”
With this, Irish people wanted to unify themselves, to create commonality on which to base nation united.
A Mother" is short story by James Joyce published in his collection Dubliners.
The story starts with brief description of Mr. Holohan, who works for an Irish cultural society and has been arranging series of concerts.
Holohan’s bad leg is prominent feature.
We are then introduced to Mrs. Kearney, who was very accomplished at young age but found that the young men of her class were intimidated by her, which prompted her to marry the working class Mr. Kearney “out of spite.” Her daughter Kathleen goes to good schools and learns to play the piano.
Mrs. Kearney decides to use the Irish Revival as means of improving the family’s social position.
She is successful enough that Kathleen gets the attention of Holohan, who hires the girl as an accompanist at four vocal concerts put on by his society.
Holohan and Mrs. Kearney collaborate well on the planning of the performances.
The first concert is sparsely attended.
The second one has more patrons, but Mrs. Kearney is bothered by the behaviour of the audience and the casual attitude of the society’s secretary, Mr. Fitzpatrick.
Mrs. Kearney is concerned that her daughter will not be paid the full contracted price but is unable to get straight answer on the matter from Holohan or Fitzpatrick.
She brings her husband to the final concert, anticipating confrontation.
On the night of the concert, Mrs. Kearney is unable to get proper answer on her request for full payment and insists her daughter will not play until paid.
The dispute holds up the beginning of the performance until Fitzpatrick pays Mrs. Kearney half the agreed amount, promising the rest at the interval.
Although the first half of the concert is successful, the description of the performers, either too immature or past their prime, is not flattering.
At the interval, Mrs. Kearney is told the rest of the money will be paid in three days.
An indignant Mrs. Kearney refuses to let her daughter play.
Another accompanist is found, and Mrs. Kearney and her family, roundly condemned by all at this point, leave.
The story presents both the mother’s greed and choler and the inexperience and condescension of the society’s members in bad light.
Grace" is short story by James Joyce written toward the end of and published in his collection Dubliners.
The story begins with an unconscious man who has fallen down the stairs in pub after heavy drinking.
A friend of his, Mr. Power, finds him, reveals him to be named Tom Kernan, and takes him home to his wife.
Kernan is salesman who once possessed an easy charm and manner but has since descended into alcoholism.
An injury to his tongue sustained during the fall keeps Kernan in bed.
Two days later, he is visited by his friends Power, M’Coy, and Cunningham.
The friends have concocted plan to get Kernan to attend Catholic retreat with them.
The four discuss many matters and finally settle upon religion.
The friends mention going to confessional retreat at Jesuit church and invite Kernan along.
He does not respond to the idea at first.
The conversation shows superficial understanding of faith, and the friends make many comical errors about the church.
The scene shifts to the Jesuit church in Gardiner Street where all are listening to priest’s shallow, businesslike sermonizing.
Kernan gin drinking in the novel "Ulysses" (which is set on June indicates the failure of his friends' plan.
According to Stanislaus Joyce, the three parts of the story recall the tripartite structure of Dante Divine Comedy ("inferno purgatorio paradiso").

The Dead"AuthorJames JoyceCountryIrelandLanguageEnglishGenre(s)Short storyPublished inDublinersMedia typePrint (hardback and paperback)Publication datePreceded by"Grace"
The Dead" is the final short story in the collection Dubliners by James Joyce.
The other stories in the collection are shorter, whereas at words, "The Dead" is almost long enough to be described as novella.
The story deals with themes of love and loss as well as raising questions about the nature of the Irish identity.
Gabriel Conroy the main character of the story.
Usher Island, the house once partly rented by Joyce’s great aunts which was the model for "the dark gaunt house on Usher Island", the principal setting for the story King William Statue, Dame Street, Dublin
Kate Morkan and Julia Morkan Gabriel and Mary Jane aunts.
They are elderly sisters who throw party every year during Christmas time.
Mary Jane Morkan niece of Kate and Julia Morkan.
Molly Ivors a long time friend of Gabriel, who is very patriotic about Ireland.
Mr Browne only Protestant guest at the party.
Freddy Malins an alcoholic and friend of Gabriel Conroy.
Patrick Morkan the deceased brother of Kate and Julia (Mary Jane father).
He famously rode mill horse that led him in circles around the statue of King William III in Dublin.
Michael Furey Gretta young love who died after waiting outside her window in the cold.
Gabriel Conroy, Gretta Conroy, Kate and Julia Morkan, and Bartell d'Arcy are all alluded to in James Joyce later work, Ulysses, though no character from "The Dead" makes direct appearance in the novel.
The story centres on Gabriel Conroy, professor and part time book reviewer, and explores the relationships he has with his family and friends.
Gabriel and his wife, Gretta, arrive late to an annual Christmas party hosted by his aunts, Kate and Julia Morkan, who eagerly receive him.
After somewhat awkward encounter with Lily, the caretaker daughter, Gabriel goes upstairs and joins the rest of the party attendees.
Gabriel worries about the speech he has to give, especially because it contains academic references that he fears his audience will not understand.
When Freddy Malins arrives drunk, as the hosts of the party had feared, Aunt Kate asks Gabriel to make sure he is all right.
As the party moves on, Gabriel is confronted by Miss Ivors, an Irish nationalist, about his publishing weekly literary column in the Unionist newspaper The Daily Express.
She teases him as "West Briton," that is, supporter of English political control of Ireland.
Gabriel recalls that he gets shillings week and "the books he received for review were almost more welcome than the paltry cheque".
He thinks this charge is highly unfair, but fails to offer satisfactory rejoinder.
The encounter ends awkwardly, which bothers Gabriel the rest of the night.
He becomes more disaffected when he tells his wife of the encounter and she expresses an interest in returning to visit her childhood home of Galway.
The music and party continues, but Gabriel retreats into himself, thinking of the snow outside and his impending speech.
Dinner begins, with Gabriel seated at the head of the table.
The guests discuss music and the practices of certain monks.
Once the dining has died down, Gabriel thinks once more about the snow and begins his speech, praising traditional Irish hospitality, observing that "we are living in sceptical...thought tormented age," and referring to Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane as the Three Graces.
The speech ends with toast, and the guests sing "For they are jolly gay fellows."
The party was winding down, and as the guests filter out and Gabriel prepares to leave, he finds his wife standing, apparently lost in thought, at the top of the stairs.
From another room, Bartell D'Arcy singing "The Lass of Aughrim" can be heard.
The Convoys left and Gabriel is excited, for it has been long time since he and Gretta have had night in hotel to themselves.
When they arrived at the hotel, Gabriel aspirations of passionate lovemaking are conclusively dashed by Gretta lack of interest.
He presses her about what is bothering her, and she admits that she is "thinking about that song, The Lass of Aughrim.
She admits that it reminds her of someone, young man named Michael Furey, who had courted her in her youth in Galway.
He used to sing The Lass of Aughrim for her.
Furey died at seventeen, early in their relationship, and she had been very much in love with him.
She believes that it was his insistence on coming to meet her in the winter and the rain, while already sick, that killed him.
After telling these things to Gabriel, Gretta falls asleep.
At first, Gabriel is shocked and dismayed that there was something of such significance in his wife life that he never knew about.
He ponders the role of the countless dead in living people lives, and observes that everyone he knows, himself included, will one day only be memory.
He finds in this fact profound affirmation of life.
Gabriel stands at the window, watching the snow fall, and the narrative expands past him, edging into the surreal and encompassing the entirety of Ireland.
As the story ends, we are told that "His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.
Dan Barry of The New York Times called "The Dead" "just about the finest short story in the English language" on the centennial of Dubliners.
T. S. Eliot called it one of the greatest short stories ever written.
Joyce biographer and critic Richard Ellmann wrote, "In its lyrical, melancholy acceptance of all that life and death offer, 'The Dead' is linchpin in Joyce work.
Cornell University Joyce scholar Daniel R. Schwarz described it as "that magnificent short novel of tenderness and passion but also of disappointed love and frustrated personal and career expectations.
The Dead" was adapted as one act play of the same name by Hugh Leonard in .
In it was adapted into the film The Dead directed by John Huston, starring Anjelica Huston as Gretta Conroy and Donal McCann as Gabriel Conroy.
In it was adapted into Broadway musical by Richard Nelson and Shaun Davey, which won Tony Award for Best Book of Musical.
