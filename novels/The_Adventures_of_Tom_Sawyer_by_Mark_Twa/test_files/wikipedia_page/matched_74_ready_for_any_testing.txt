the novel has elements of humour satire and social criticism features that later made mark twain one of the most important authors of american literature
the novel is set around twain actual boyhood home of hannibal near st louis and many of the places in it are real and today support tourist industry as result
to help show how mischievous and messy boyhood was the miriam and ira wallach division of art prints and photographs shows picture of young boy smoking pipe sawing furniture climbing all over the place and sleeping
reluctantly huck_finn agrees and goes back to the widow mark twain describes some autobiographical events in the book in twain novel tom_sawyer and his friend are young when they decided they want to learn how to smoke pipe
tom_sawyer and joe_harper do this to show just how cool they are to the other boy tom_sawyer is twain first attempt to write novel on his own
he had previously written contemporary autobiographical narratives the innocents abroad or the new pilgrims progress roughing it and two short texts called sketches which parody the youth literature of the time
these are the story of the good boy and the story of the wicked little boy which are satirical texts of few pages
in the first model child is never rewarded and ends up dying before he can declaim his last words which he has carefully prepared
tom_sawyer appears as mixture of these little boy since he is at the same time scamp and boy endowed with certain generosity
in the second story an evil little boy steals and lies like tom_sawyer but finishes rich and successful by the time he wrote tom_sawyer
twain was already successful author based on the popularity of the innocents abroad he owned large house in hartford connecticut but needed another success to support himself with wife and two daughters
he had earlier written an unpublished memoir of his own life on the mississippi and corresponded with boyhood friend will bowen that had evoked many memory and was used as source of material
he had collaborated on novel with charles dudley warner the gilded age published in twain named his fictional character after san francisco fireman whom he met in june
the real tom_sawyer was local hero famous for rescuing passengers after shipwreck the two remained friendly during twain three year stay in san francisco often drinking and gambling together
in november twain gave the manuscript to elisha bliss of the american publishing company who sent it to true williams for the illustrations
a little later twain had the text also quickly published at chatto and windus of london in june but without illustration
pirate editions appeared very quickly in canada and germany the american publishing company finally published its edition in december which was the first illustrated edition of tom_sawyer
after completing his manuscript twain had copy made of it it is this copy which was read and annotated by his friend william dean howells
twain then made his own corrections based on howells comments which he later incorporated in the original manuscript but some corrections escaped him
to further complicate matters twain was personally concerned with the revision of the proofs of the american edition which he did not do for the english edition
the english edition was based on this corrected copy while the illustrated american edition was based on the original manuscript the american edition is therefore considered the authoritative edition
in its sequel adventures of huckleberry_finn mark twain changes to first person narrative which takes moral conflicts more personally and thus makes greater social criticism possible
the two others subsequent books tom_sawyer abroad and tom_sawyer detective are similarly in the first person narrative from the perspective of huckleberry_finn
the book has raised controversy for its use of the racial epithet nigger bowdlerized version aroused indignation among some literary critics
a third person narrator describes the experiences of the boy interspersed with occasional social commentary the book has also gotten criticism for the caricature like portrayal of native americans through the character injun joe_harper
he is depicted as malevolent for the sake of malevolence is not allowed to redeem himself in any way by twain dies pitiful and despairing death in cave and upon his death is treated as tourist attraction
