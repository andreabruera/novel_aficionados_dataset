once more high up in society contentment preface most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred one or two were experiences of my own the rest those of boy who were schoolmates of mine
huck_finn is drawn from life tom_sawyer also but not from an individual he is a combination of the characteristics of three boy whom i knew and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture
the odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and slaves in the west at the period of this story that is to say thirty or forty years ago
although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boy and girl i hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what they once were themselves and of how they felt and thought and talked and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in
tom_sawyer backs his statement tail piece huck_finn transformed comfortable the author hartford chapter i tom_sawyer no answer tom_sawyer no answer
the old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room then she put them up and looked out under them
she seldom or never looked through them for so small a thing as a boy they were her state pair the pride of her heart and were built for style not service she could have seen through a pair of stove lids just as well
she looked perplexed for a moment and then said not fiercely but still loud enough for the furniture to hear well i lay if i get hold of you
she did not finish for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with
what gone with that boy i wonder you tom_sawyer no answer i ll she resurrected nothing but the cat
she went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the tomato vines and jimpson weeds that constituted the garden
i never did see the beat of that boy no tom_sawyer so she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted o u tom_sawyer
there was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight
there i might a thought of that closet what you been doing in there nothing nothing look at your hands
and look at your mouth what is that truck i dont know aunt well i know it jam that what it is
forty time i ve said if you didnt let that jam alone i skin you hand me that switch the switch hovered in the air the peril was desperate
my look behind you aunt the old lady whirled round and snatched her skirts out of danger the lad fled on the instant scrambled up the high board fence and disappeared over it
his aunt_polly stood surprised a moment and then broke into a gentle laugh hang the boy cant i never learn anything
aint he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time but old fools is the biggest fools there is
cant learn an old dog new tricks as the saying is but my goodness he never plays them alike two days and how is a body to know what coming
he pears to know just how long he can torment me before i get my dander up and he knows if he can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh it all down again
and i cant hit him a lick i aint doing my duty by that boy and that the lord truth goodness knows
spare the rod and spile the child as the good book says i a laying up sin and suffering for us both i know
he full of the old scratch but laws a me he my own dead sister boy poor thing and i aint got the heart to lash him somehow
every time i let him off my conscience does hurt me so and every time i hit him my old heart most breaks
well a well man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble as the scripture says and i reckon it so
he ll play hookey this evening and southwestern for afternoon i ll just be obleeged to make him work tomorrow to punish him
it mighty hard to make him work saturdays when all the boy is having holiday but he hates work more than he hates anything else and i ve got to do some of my duty by him or
he got back home barely in season to help jim_hollis the small colored boy saw next day wood and split the kindlings before supper at least he was there in time to tell his adventures to jim_hollis while jim_hollis did three fourths of the work
i ll be the ruination of the child tom_sawyer did play hookey and he had a very good time tom_sawyer younger brother or rather half brother
sid was already through with his part of the work picking up chips for he was a quiet boy and had no adventurous trouble some way
while tom_sawyer was eating his supper and stealing sugar as opportunity offered aunt_polly asked him questions that were full of guile and very deep for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments
like many other simple hearted soul it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy and she loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low cunning
said she tom_sawyer it was middling warm in school warnt it yes powerful warm warnt it yes didnt you want to go in a swimming tom_sawyer
a bit of a scare shot through tom_sawyer a touch of uncomfortable suspicion he searched aunt_polly face but it told him nothing
so he said no well not very much the old lady reached out her hand and felt tom_sawyer shirt and said but you aint too warm now though
and it flattered her to reflect that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing that that was what she had in her mind
but in spite of her tom_sawyer knew where the wind lay now so he forestalled what might be the next move some of us pumped on our heads mine damp yet
see aunt_polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence and missed a trick then she had a new inspiration
tom_sawyer you didnt have to undo your shirt collar where i sewed it to pump on your head did you unbutton your jacket
the trouble vanished out of tom_sawyer face he opened his jacket his shirt collar was securely sewed bother well go long with you
i made sure you played hookey and been a swimming but i forgive ye tom_sawyer i reckon you re a kind of a singed cat as the saying is
better you look this time she was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried and half glad that tom_sawyer had stumbled into obedient conduct for once
but sidney said well now if i didnt think you sewed his collar with white thread but it black why i did sew it with white
tom_sawyer but tom_sawyer did not wait for the rest as he went out at the door he said siddy i ll lick you for that
in a safe place tom_sawyer examined two large needles which were thrust into the lapels of his jacket and had thread bound about them one needle carried white thread and the other black
he said she never noticed if it hadnt been for sid confound it sometimes she sews it with white and sometimes she sews it with black
i wish to gee miny she stick to one ort other i cant keep the run of em but i bet you
i ll lam sid for that i ll learn him he was not the model boy of the village he knew the model boy very well though and loathed him
not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a man are to a man but because a new and powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of his mind for the time just as men misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises
this new interest was a valued novelty in whistling which he had just acquired from a negro and he was suffering to practise it un disturbed
it consisted in a peculiar bird like turn a sort of liquid warble produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the music the reader probably remembers how to do it if he has ever been a boy
diligence and attention soon gave him the knack of it and he strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude
he felt much as an astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet no doubt as far as strong deep unalloyed pleasure is concerned the advantage was with the boy not the astronomer
within two minute or even less he had forgotten all his troubles the summer evenings were long it was not dark yet
a new comer of any age or either sex was an im pressive curiosity in the poor little shabby village of st petersburg
presently tom_sawyer checked his whistle a stranger was before him a boy a shade larger than himself this boy was well dressed too
well dressed on a week day this was simply as astounding his cap was a dainty thing his close buttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty and so were his pantaloons
he had shoes on and it was only friday he even wore a necktie a bright bit of ribbon he had a citified air about him that ate into tom_sawyer vitals
the more tom_sawyer stared at the splendid marvel the higher he turned up his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to grow
if one moved the other moved but only sidewise in a circle they kept face to face and eye to eye all the time
neither boy spoke finally tom_sawyer said i can lick you i like to see you try it well i can do it
no you cant either yes i can no you cant i can you cant
can cant an uncomfortable pause then tom_sawyer said what your name tisnt any of your business maybe well i low
i ll make it my business well why dont you if you say much i will much much much there now
oh you think you re mighty smart dont you i could lick you with one hand tied behind me if i wanted to
well why dont you do it you say you can do it well i will if you fool with me
oh yes i ve seen whole families in the same fix smarty you think you re some now dont you oh what a hat
you can lump that hat if you dont like it i dare you to knock it off and anybody that ll take a dare will suck eggs
you re a liar you re another you re a fighting liar and dasnt take it up aw take a walk
say if you give me much more of your sass i ll take and bounce a rock off your head oh of course you will
well i will well why dont you do it then what do you keep saying you will for
why dont you do it it because you re afraid i aint afraid you are i aint you are
another pause and more eying and sidling around each other presently they were shoulder to shoulder tom_sawyer said get away from here
so they stood each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace and both shoving with might and main and glowering at each other with hate
after struggling till both were hot and flushed each relaxed his strain with watchful caution and tom_sawyer said you re a coward and a pup
i ll tell my big brother on you and he can thrash you with his little finger and i ll make him do it too
go away yourself i wont i wont either but neither could get an advantage what do i care for your big brother
i ve got a brother that bigger than he is and what more he can throw him over that fence too both brothers were imaginary
tom_sawyer drew a line in the dust with his big toe and said i dare you to step over that and i ll lick you till you cant stand up
that a lie your saying so dont make it so anybody that ll take a dare will steal sheep
the new boy stepped over promptly and said now you said you do it now let see you do it
dont you crowd me now you better look out well you said you do it why dont you do it by jingo
for two cents i will do it the new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out with derision
in an instant both boy were rolling and tumbling in the dirt gripped together like cats and for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other hair and clothes punched and scratched each other nose and covered themselves with dust and glory
presently the confusion took form and through the fog of battle tom_sawyer appeared seated astride the new boy and pounding him with his fists
tom_sawyer struck them to the ground holler nuff said he the boy only struggled to free himself he was crying mainly from rage
holler nuff and the pounding went on at last the stranger got out a smothered nuff and tom_sawyer let him up and said now that ll learn you
the new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes sobbing snuffling and occasionally looking back and shaking his head and threatening what he would do to tom_sawyer the next time he caught him out
to which tom_sawyer responded with jeers and started off in high feather and as soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone threw it and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran like an antelope
better look out who you re fooling with next time tom_sawyer chased the traitor home and thus found out where he lived
he then held a position at the gate for some time daring the enemy to come outside but the enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined
at last the enemy mother appeared and called tom_sawyer a bad vicious vulgar child and ordered him away so he went away but he said he lowed to lay for that boy
he got home pretty late that night and when he climbed cautiously in at the window he uncovered an ambuscade in the person of his aunt and when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turn his saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine in its firmness
chapter ii saturday morning was come and all the summer world was bright and fresh and brimming with life there was a song in every heart and if the heart was young the music issued at the lips
there was cheer in every face and a spring in every step the locust trees were in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air
cardiff hill beyond the village and above it was green with vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem a delectable land dreamy reposeful and inviting
tom_sawyer appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long handled brush he surveyed the fence and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit
sighing he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank repeated the operation did it again compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence and sat down on a tree box discouraged
thirty yards of board fence nine feet high life to him seemed hollow and existence but a burden jim_hollis came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail and singing buffalo gals
bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in tom_sawyer eyes before but now it did not strike him so
he remembered that there was company at the pump white mulatto and negro boy and girl were always there waiting their turns resting trading playthings quarrelling fighting skylarking
and he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off jim_hollis never got back with a bucket of water under an hour and even then somebody generally had to go after him
tom_sawyer said say jim_hollis i ll fetch the water if you ll whitewash some jim_hollis shook his head and said cant mars tom_sawyer
ole missis she tole me i got to go an git dis water an not stop foolin roun wid anybody she say she spec
mars tom_sawyer gwine to ax me to whitewash an so she tole me go long an tend to my own business she lowed she tend to de whitewashin
oh never you mind what she said jim_hollis that the way she always talks gimme the bucket i wont be gone only a a minute
she wont ever know oh i dasnt mars tom_sawyer ole missis she take an tar de head off me
deed she would she she never licks anybody whacks em over the head with her thimble and who cares for that i like to know
she talks awful but talk dont hurt anyways it dont if she dont cry jim_hollis i ll give you a marvel i ll give you a white alley
jim_hollis began to waver white alley jim_hollis and it a bully taw my dat a mighty gay marvel i tell you
but mars tom_sawyer i powerful fraid ole missis and besides if you will i ll show you my sore toe jim_hollis was only human this attraction was too much for him
he put down his pail took the white alley and bent over the toe with absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound
in another moment he was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear tom_sawyer was whitewashing with vigor and aunt_polly was retiring from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye
but tom_sawyer energy did not last he began to think of the fun he had planned for this day and his sorrows multiplied
soon the free boy would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions and they would make a world of fun of him for having to work the very thought of it burnt him like fire
he got out his worldly wealth and examined it bit of toys marbles and trash enough to buy an exchange of work maybe but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour of pure freedom
so he returned his straitened means to his pocket and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boy at this dark and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him
nothing less than a great magnificent inspiration he took up his brush and went tranquilly to work ben_rogers hove in sight presently the very boy of all boy whose ridicule he had been dreading
he was eating an apple and giving a long melodious whoop at intervals followed by a deep toned ding dong dong ding dong dong for he was personating a steamboat
as he drew near he slackened speed took the middle of the street leaned far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp and circumstance for he was personating the big missouri and considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water
he was boat and captain and engine bells combined so he had to imagine himself standing on his own hurricane deck giving the orders and executing them stop her sir
ben_rogers gait was the hop skip and jump proof enough that his heart was light and his anticipations high ting a ling ling the headway ran almost out and he drew up slowly toward the sidewalk
ship up to back ting a ling ling his arms straightened and stiffened down his sides set her back on the stabboard ting a ling ling
chow ch chow wow chow his right hand mean time describing stately circles for it was representing a forty foot wheel let her go back on the labboard
ting a ling ling chow ch chow chow the left hand began to describe circles stop the stabboard ting a ling ling stop the labboard come ahead on the stabboard
stop her let your outside turn over slow ting a ling ling chow ow ow get out that head line lively now come out with your spring line what re you about there
take a turn round that stump with the bight of it stand by that stage now let her go done with the engines sir
ting a ling ling sht ht sht trying the gauge cocks tom_sawyer went on whitewashing paid no attention to the steamboat ben_rogers stared a moment and then said
tom_sawyer surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist then he gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result as before
hi yi you re up a stump aint you no answer ben_rogers ranged up alongside of him tom_sawyer mouth watered for the apple but he stuck to his work
ben_rogers said hello old chap you got to work hey tom_sawyer wheeled suddenly and said why it you ben_rogers i warnt noticing
say i going in a swimming i am dont you wish you could but of course you druther work wouldnt you course you would
tom_sawyer contemplated the boy a bit and said what do you call work why aint that work tom_sawyer resumed his whitewashing and answered carelessly well maybe it is and maybe it aint
all i know is it suits tom_sawyer oh come now you dont mean to let on that you like it
the brush continued to move like it well i dont see why i oughtnt to like it does a boy get a chance to whitewash a fence every day
tom_sawyer swept his brush daintily back and forth stepped back to note the effect added a touch here and there criticised the effect again
that put the thing in a new light ben_rogers stopped nibbling his apple ben_rogers watching every move and getting more and more interested more and more absorbed
presently he said say tom_sawyer let me whitewash a little tom_sawyer considered was about to consent but he altered his mind no no i reckon it wouldnt hardly do ben_rogers
you see aunt_polly awful particular about this fence right here on the street you know but if it was the back fence i wouldnt mind and she wouldnt
yes she awful particular about this fence it got to be done very careful i reckon there aint one boy in a thousand maybe two thousand that can do it the way it got to be done
no is that so oh come now lemme just try only just a little i let you if you was me tom_sawyer
ben_rogers i like to honest injun but aunt_polly well jim_hollis wanted to do it but she wouldnt let him sid wanted to do it and she wouldnt let sid
now dont you see how i fixed if you was to tackle this fence and anything was to happen to it
oh shucks i ll be just as careful now lemme try say i ll give you the core of my apple
well here no ben_rogers now dont i afeard i ll give you all of it tom_sawyer gave up the brush with reluctance in his face but alacrity in his heart
and while the late steamer big missouri worked and sweated in the sun the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by dangled his legs munched his apple and planned the slaughter of more innocents
by the time ben_rogers was fagged out tom_sawyer had traded the next chance to billy fisher for a kite in good repair and when he played out johnny miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with and so on and so on hour after hour
and when the middle of the afternoon came from being a poor poverty stricken boy in the morning tom_sawyer was literally rolling in wealth
he had besides the thing before mentioned twelve marbles part of a jews harp a piece of blue bottle glass to look through a spool cannon a key that wouldnt unlock anything a fragment of chalk a glass stopper of a decanter a tin soldier a couple of tadpoles six fire crackers a kitten with only one eye a brass door knob a dog collar but no dog the handle of a knife four pieces of orange peel and a dilapidated old window sash
he had had a nice good idle time all the while plenty of company and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it
there was no lack of material boy happened along every little while they came to jeer but remained to whitewash if he hadnt run out of whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village
he had discovered a great law of human action without knowing it namely that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain
if he had been a great and wise philosopher like the writer of this book he would now have comprehended that work consists of whatever a body is obliged to do and that play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do
tom_sawyer said to himself that it was not such a hollow world after all and this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread mill is work
there are wealthy gentlemen in england who drive four horse passenger coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line in the summer because the privilege costs them considerable money but if they were offered wages for the service that would turn it into work
the boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place in his worldly circumstances and then wended toward headquarters to report
chapter iii tom_sawyer presented himself before aunt_polly who was sitting by an open window in a pleasant rearward apartment which was bedroom breakfast room dining room and library combined
the balmy summer air the restful quiet the odor of the flowers and the drowsing murmur of the bees had had their effect and she was nodding over her knitting for she had no company but the cat and it was asleep in her lap
while rolling ten pins or climbing mont blanc is only amusement and then they would resign her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety
she had thought that of course tom_sawyer had deserted long ago and she wondered at seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way
he said maynt i go and play now aunt what a ready how much have you done it all done aunt
tom_sawyer dont lie to me i cant bear it i aint aunt it is all done aunt_polly placed small trust in such evidence
she went out to see for herself and she would have been content to find twenty per cent of tom_sawyer statement true
when she found the entire fence white washed and not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated and even a streak added to the ground her astonishment was almost unspeakable
she said well i never there no getting round it you can work when you re a mind to tom_sawyer and then she diluted the compliment by adding
but it powerful seldom you re a mind to i bound to say well go long and play but mind you get back some time in a week or i ll tan you
she was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she took him into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it to him along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort
then he skipped out and saw sid just starting up the outside stairway that led to the back rooms on the second floor
and while she closed with a happy scriptural flourish he hooked a doughnut clods were handy and the air was full of them in a twinkling
they raged around sid like a hail storm and before aunt_polly could collect her surprised faculties and sally to the rescue six or seven clods had taken personal effect and tom_sawyer was over the fence and gone
his soul was at peace now that he had settled with sid for calling attention to his black thread and getting him into trouble
there was a gate but as a general thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it tom_sawyer skirted the block and came round into a muddy alley that led by the back of his aunt cow stable
he presently got safely beyond the reach of capture and punishment and hastened toward the public square of the village where two military companies of boy had met for conflict according to previous appointment
these two great commanders did not condescend to fight in person that being better suited to the still smaller fry but sat together on an eminence and conducted the field operations by orders delivered through aides de camp
tom_sawyer was general of one of these armies joe_harper a bosom friend general of the other tom_sawyer army won a great victory after a long and hard fought battle
then the dead were counted prisoners exchanged the terms of the next disagreement agreed upon and the day for the necessary battle appointed after which the armies fell into line and marched away and tom_sawyer turned homeward alone
as he was passing by the house where jeff_thatcher becky_thatcher lived he saw a new girl in the garden a lovely little blue eyed creature with yellow hair plaited into two long tails white summer frock and embroidered pan talettes
the fresh crowned hero fell without firing a shot a certain amy_lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even a memory of herself behind
he had thought he loved her to distraction he had regarded his passion as adoration and behold it was only a poor little evanescent partiality
he had been months winning her she had confessed hardly a week ago he had been the happiest and the proudest boy in the world only seven short days and here in one instant of time she had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit is done
he worshipped this new angel with furtive eye till he saw that she had discovered him then he pretended he did not know she was present and began to show off in all sorts of absurd boyish way in order to win her admiration
he kept up this grotesque foolishness for some time but by and by while he was in the midst of some dangerous gymnastic performances he glanced aside and saw that the little girl was wending her way toward the house
tom_sawyer came up to the fence and leaned on it grieving and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer she halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door
tom_sawyer heaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold but his face lit up right away for she tossed a pansy over the fence a moment before she disappeared
the boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower and then shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as if he had discovered something of interest going on in that direction
presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on his nose with his head tilted far back and as he moved from side to side in his efforts he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy finally his bare foot rested upon it his pliant toes closed upon it and he hopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner
but only for a minute only while he could button the flower inside his jacket next his heart or next his stomach possibly for he was not much posted in anatomy and not hypercritical anyway
he returned now and hung about the fence till nightfall showing off as before but the girl never exhibited herself again though tom_sawyer comforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near some window meantime and been aware of his attentions
finally he strode home reluctantly with his poor head full of visions all through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wondered what had got into the child
he took a good scolding about clodding sid and did not seem to mind it in the least he tried to steal sugar under his aunt very nose and got his knuckles rapped for it
he said aunt you dont whack sid when he takes it well sid dont torment a body the way you do
presently she stepped into the kitchen and sid happy in his immunity reached for the sugar bowl a sort of glorying over tom_sawyer which was wellnigh unbearable
you be always into that sugar if i warnt watching you but sid fingers slipped and the bowl dropped and broke
he said to himself that he would not speak a word even when his aunt came in but would sit perfectly still till she asked who did the mischief and then he would tell and there would be nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model catch it
he was so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath from over her spectacles
tom_sawyer was in ecstasies in such ecstasies that he even controlled his tongue and was silent he said to himself now it coming
the potent palm was uplifted to strike again when tom_sawyer cried out hold on now what er you belting me for sid broke it
and the next instant he was sprawling on the floor aunt_polly paused perplexed and tom_sawyer looked for healing pity but when she got her tongue again she only said umf
well you didnt get a lick amiss i reckon you been into some other audacious mischief when i wasnt around like enough
then her conscience reproached her and she yearned to say something kind and loving but she judged that this would be construed into a confession that she had been in the wrong and discipline forbade that
so she kept silence and went about her affairs with a troubled heart tom_sawyer sulked in a corner and exalted his woes
he knew that in her heart his aunt was on her knees to him and he was morosely gratified by the consciousness of it
he knew that a yearning glance fell upon him now and then through a film of tears but he refused recognition of it
he pictured himself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseeching one little forgiving word but he would turn his face to the wall and die with that word unsaid
and he pictured himself brought home from the river dead with his curls all wet and his sore heart at rest
how she would throw herself upon him and how her tears would fall like rain and her lips pray god to give her back her boy
he would hang out no signals he would take notice of none ah how would she feel then and she would never never abuse him any more
but he would lie there cold and white and make no sign a poor little sufferer whose griefs were at an end
he so worked upon his feelings with the pathos of these dreams that he had to keep swallowing he was so like to choke and his eyes swam in a blur of water which overflowed when he winked and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose
and such a luxury to him was this petting of his sorrows that he could not bear to have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon it
it was too sacred for such contact and so presently when his cousin mary danced in all alive with the joy of seeing home again after an age long visit of one week to the country he got up and moved in clouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine in at the other
a log raft in the river invited him and he seated himself on its outer edge and contemplated the dreary vastness of the stream wishing the while that he could only be drowned all at once and unconsciously without undergoing the uncomfortable routine devised by nature
he wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boy and sought desolate places that were in harmony with his spirit then he thought of his flower
he got it out rumpled and wilted and it mightily increased his dismal felicity he wondered if she would pity him if she knew
would she cry and wish that she had a right to put her arms around his neck and comfort him or would she turn coldly away like all the hollow world
this picture brought such an agony of pleasurable suffering that he worked it over and over again in his mind and set it up in new and varied lights till he wore it threadbare
about half past nine or ten clock he came along the deserted street to where the adored unknown lived he paused a moment no sound fell upon his listening ear a candle was casting a dull glow upon the curtain of a second story window
he climbed the fence threaded his stealthy way through the plants till he stood under that window he looked up at it long and with emotion then he laid him down on the ground under it disposing himself upon his back with his hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poor wilted flower
and thus he would die out in the cold world with no shelter over his homeless head no friendly hand to wipe the death damps from his brow no loving face to bend pityingly over him when the great agony came
at last he rose up sighing and departed in the darkness was the sacred presence there and thus she would see him when she looked out upon the glad morning
and oh would she drop one little tear upon his poor lifeless form would she heave one little sigh to see a bright young life so rudely blighted so untimely cut down
the window went up a maid servant discordant voice profaned the holy calm and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyr remains
there was a whiz as of a missile in the air mingled with the murmur of a curse a sound as of shivering glass followed and a small vague form went over the fence and shot away in the gloom
not long after as tom_sawyer all undressed for bed was surveying his drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip sid woke up but if he had any dim idea of making any references to allusions he thought better of it and held his peace for there was danger in tom_sawyer eye
the strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort tom_sawyer turned in without the added vexation of prayers and sid made mental note of the omission
breakfast over aunt_polly had family worship it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid courses of scriptural quotations welded together with a thin mortar of originality and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of the mosaic law as from sinai
chapter iv the sun rose upon a tranquil world and beamed down upon the peaceful village like a benediction then tom_sawyer girded up his loins so to speak and went to work to get his verses
tom_sawyer bent all his energies to the memorizing of five verses and he chose part of the sermon on the mount because he could find no verses that were shorter
at the end of half an hour tom_sawyer had a vague general idea of his lesson but no more for his mind was traversing the whole field of human thought and his hands were busy with distracting recreations
sid had learned his lesson days before mary took his book to hear him recite and he tried to find his way through the fog
blessed are the a a poor yes poor blessed are the poor a a in spirit in spirit blessed are the poor in spirit for they they
theirs for theirs blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
blessed are they that mourn for they they sh for they a h a for they h oh i dont know what it is
shall oh shall for they shall for they shall a a shall mourn a a blessed are they that shall they that a they that shall mourn for they shall a shall what
why dont you tell me mary what do you want to be so mean for oh tom_sawyer you poor thick headed thing i not teasing you
i wouldnt do that you must go and learn it again dont you be discouraged tom_sawyer you ll manage it and if you do i ll give you something ever so nice
there now that a good boy all right what is it mary tell me what it is never you mind tom_sawyer
you know if i say it nice it is nice you bet you that so mary all right i ll tackle it again
and he did tackle it again and under the double pressure of curiosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that he accomplished a shining success
mary gave him a brand new barlow knife worth twelve and a half cents and the convulsion of delight that swept his system shook him to his foundations
true the knife would not cut anything but it was a sure enough barlow and there was inconceivable grandeur in that though where the western boy ever got the idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to its injury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so perhaps
tom_sawyer contrived to scarify the cupboard with it and was arranging to begin on the bureau when he was called off to dress for sunday school
mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap and he went outside the door and set the basin on a little bench there then he dipped the soap in the water and laid it down turned up his sleeves poured out the water on the ground gently and then entered the kitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind the door
but mary removed the towel and said now aint you ashamed tom_sawyer you mustnt be so bad water wont hurt you
the basin was refilled and this time he stood over it a little while gathering resolution took in a big breath and began
when he entered the kitchen presently with both eyes shut and groping for the towel with his hands an honorable testimony of suds and water was dripping from his face
but when he emerged from the towel he was not yet satisfactory for the clean territory stopped short at his chin and his jaws like a mask below and beyond this line there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in front and backward around his neck
he was a man and a brother without distinction of color and his saturated hair was neatly brushed and its short curls wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect
he privately smoothed out the curls with labor and difficulty and plastered his hair close down to his head for he held curls to be effeminate and his own filled his life with bitterness
then mary got out a suit of his clothing that had been used only on sundays during two years they were simply called his other clothes and
tom_sawyer was a trifle disconcerted mary took him in hand and when she was done with him so by that we know the size of his wardrobe
the girl put him to rights after he had dressed himself she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin turned his vast shirt collar down over his shoulders brushed him off and crowned him with his speckled straw hat
he was fully as uncomfortable as he looked for there was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him
he hoped that mary would forget his shoes but the hope was blighted she coated them thoroughly with tallow as was the custom and brought them out
he now looked exceedingly improved and uncomfortable he lost his temper and said he was always being made to do everything he didnt want to do
mary was soon ready and the three children set out for sunday school a place that tom_sawyer hated with his whole heart but sid and mary were fond of it
but mary said persuasively please tom_sawyer that a good boy so he got into the shoes snarling sabbath school hours were from nine to half past ten and then church service
the church high backed uncushioned pews would seat about three hundred persons the edifice was but a small plain affair with a sort of pine board tree box on top of it for a steeple
two of the children always remained for the sermon voluntarily and the other always remained too for stronger reasons at the door tom_sawyer dropped back a step and accosted a sunday dressed comrade say billy got a yaller ticket
yes what ll you take for her what ll you give piece of lickrish and a fish hook less see em tom_sawyer exhibited
then tom_sawyer traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets and some small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones
they were satisfactory and the property changed hands he waylaid other boy as they came and went on buying tickets of various colors ten or fifteen minute longer
he entered the church now with a swarm of clean and noisy boy and girl proceeded to his seat and started a quarrel with the first boy that came handy
the teacher a grave elderly man interfered then turned his back a moment and tom_sawyer pulled a boy hair in the next bench and was absorbed in his book when the boy turned around stuck a pin in another boy presently in order to hear him say ouch and got a new reprimand from his teacher
when they came to recite their lessons not one of them knew his verses perfectly but had to be prompted all along
however they worried through and each got his reward in small blue tickets each with a passage of scripture on it each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation
ten blue tickets equalled a red one and could be exchanged for it ten red tickets equalled a yellow one for ten yellow tickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound bible worth forty cents in those easy time to the pupil
how many of my readers would have the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses even for a dore bible
and yet mary had acquired two bibles in this way it was the patient work of two years and a boy of german parentage had won four or five
he once recited three thousand verses without stopping but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great and he was little better than an idiot from that day forth a grievous misfortune for the school for on great occasions before company the superintendent as tom_sawyer expressed it had always made this boy come out and spread himself
only the older pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a bible and so the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthy circumstance the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple of weeks
it is possible that tom_sawyer mental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes but unquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the glory and the eclat that came with it
in due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit with a closed hymn book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its leaves and commanded attention
when a sunday school superintendent makes his customary little speech a hymn book in the hand is as necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert though why is a mystery for neither the hymn book nor the sheet of music is ever referred to by the sufferer
this superintendent was a slim creature of thirty five with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair he wore a stiff standing collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead and a turning of the whole body when a side view was required his chin was propped on a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank note and had fringed ends his boot toes were turned sharply up in the fashion of the day like sleigh runners an effect patiently and laboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a wall for hours together
mr walters was very earnest of mien and very sincere and honest at heart and he held sacred thing and places in such reverence and so separated them from worldly matters that unconsciously to himself his sunday school voice had acquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on week days
he began after this fashion now children i want you all to sit up just as straight and pretty as you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two
tom_sawyer whole class were of a pattern restless noisy and troublesome there that is it that is the way good little boy and girl should do
i see one little girl who is looking out of the window i am afraid she thinks i am out there somewhere perhaps up in one of the trees making a speech to the little birds
i want to tell you how good it makes me feel to see so many bright clean little faces assembled in a place like this learning to do right and be good
applausive titter and so forth and so on it is not necessary to set down the rest of the oration
the latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fights and other recreations among certain of the bad boy and by fidgetings and whisperings that extended far and wide washing even to the bases of isolated and incorruptible rocks like sid and mary
but now every sound ceased suddenly with the subsidence of mr walters voice and the conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silent gratitude
a good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event which was more or less rare the entrance of visitors lawyer becky_thatcher accompanied by a very feeble and aged man a fine portly middle aged gentleman with iron gray hair and a dignified lady who was doubtless the latter wife
it was of a pattern which does not vary and so it is familiar to us all the lady was leading a child
tom_sawyer had been restless and full of chafings and repinings conscience smitten too he could not meet amy_lawrence eye he could not brook her loving gaze
the next moment he was showing off with all his might cuffing boy pulling hair making faces in a word using every art that seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause
his exaltation had but one alloy the memory of his humiliation in this angel garden and that record in sand was fast washing out under the waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now
the visitors were given the highest seat of honor and as soon as mr walters speech was finished he introduced them to the school
the middle aged man turned out to be a prodigious personage no less a one than the county judge altogether the most august creation these children had ever looked upon and they wondered what kind of material he was made of and they half wanted to hear him roar and were half afraid he might too
he was from constantinople twelve miles away so he had travelled and seen the world these very eyes had looked upon the county court house which was said to have a tin roof
but when he saw this small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss in a moment the awe which these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silence and the ranks of staring eyes
this was the great judge becky_thatcher brother of their own lawyer jeff_thatcher becky_thatcher immediately went forward to be familiar with the great man and be envied by the school
it would have been music to his soul to hear the whisperings look at him jim_hollis he a going up there
say look he a going to shake hands with him he is shaking hands with him by jings dont you wish you was jeff_thatcher
mr walters fell to showing off with all sorts of official bustlings and activities giving orders delivering judgments discharging directions here there everywhere that he could find a target
the librarian showed off running hither and thither with his arms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss that insect authority delights in
the young lady teachers showed off bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed lifting pretty warning fingers at bad little boy and patting good ones lovingly
the young gentlemen teachers showed off with small scoldings and other little displays of authority and fine attention to discipline and most of the teachers of both sexes found business up at the library by the pulpit and it was business that frequently had to be done over again two or three time with much seeming vexation
the little girl showed off in various way and the little boy showed off with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wads and the murmur of scufflings
and above it all the great man sat and beamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house and warmed himself in the sun of his own grandeur for he was showing off too
there was only one thing wanting to make mr walters ecstasy complete and that was a chance to deliver a bible prize and exhibit a prodigy
several pupils had a few yellow tickets but none had enough he had been around among the star pupils inquiring he would have given worlds now to have that german lad back again with a sound mind
and now at this moment when hope was dead tom_sawyer came forward with nine yellow tickets nine red tickets and ten blue ones and demanded a bible
this was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky walters was not expecting an application from this source for the next ten years
tom_sawyer was therefore elevated to a place with the judge and the other elect and the great news was announced from headquarters
it was the most stunning surprise of the decade and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new hero up to the judicial one altitude and the school had two marvels to gaze upon in place of one
the boy were all eaten up with envy but those that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived too late that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor by trading tickets to tom_sawyer for the wealth he had amassed in selling whitewashing privileges
but there was no getting around it here were the certified checks and they were good for their face these despised themselves as being the dupes of a wily fraud a guileful snake in the grass
the prize was delivered to tom_sawyer with as much effusion as the superintendent could pump up under the circumstances but it lacked somewhat of the true gush for the poor fellow instinct taught him that there was a mystery here that could not well bear the light perhaps
it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves of scriptural wisdom on his premises a dozen would strain his capacity without a doubt
she wondered then she was just a grain troubled next a dim suspicion came and went came again she watched a furtive glance told her worlds and then her heart broke and she was jealous and angry and the tears came and she hated everybody
amy_lawrence was proud and glad and she tried to make tom_sawyer see it in her face but he wouldnt look tom_sawyer most of all she thought
his breath would hardly come his heart quaked partly because of the awful greatness of the man but mainly because he was her parent
tom_sawyer was introduced to the judge but his tongue was tied he would have liked to fall down and worship him if it were in the dark
the judge put his hand on tom_sawyer head and called him a fine little man and asked him what his name was
the boy stammered gasped and got it out tom_sawyer oh no not tom_sawyer it is thomas_sawyer ah that it
i thought there was more to it maybe that very well but you ve another one i daresay and you ll tell it to me wont you
tell the gentleman your other name thomas_sawyer said walters and say sir you mustnt forget your manners thomas_sawyer sir
that it that a good boy fine boy fine manly little fellow two thousand verses is a great many very very great many
and you never can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them for knowledge is worth more than anything there is in the world it what makes great men and good men you ll be a great man and a good man yourself some day thomas_sawyer and then you ll look back and say it all owing to the precious sunday school privileges of my boyhood it all owing to my dear teachers that taught me to learn it all owing to the good superintendent who encouraged me and watched over me and gave me a beautiful bible a splendid elegant bible to keep and have it all for my own always it all owing to right bringing up
that is what you will say thomas_sawyer and you wouldnt take any money for those two thousand verses no indeed you wouldnt and now you wouldnt mind telling me and this lady some of the thing you ve learned no
i know you wouldnt for we are proud of little boy that learn now no doubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples
wont you tell us the names of the first two that were appointed tom_sawyer was tugging at a button hole and looking sheepish
he said to himself it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplest question why did the judge ask him
he blushed now and his eyes fell mr walters heart sank within him yet he felt obliged to speak up and say answer the gentleman thomas_sawyer dont be afraid
tom_sawyer still hung fire now i know you ll tell me said the lady the names of the first two disciples were david and goliah
about half past ten the cracked bell of the small church began to ring and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon
let us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene chapter the sunday school children distributed themselves about the house and occupied pews with their parents so as to be under supervision
tom_sawyer being placed next the aisle in order that he might be as far away from the open window and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible
the crowd filed up the aisles the aged and needy postmaster who had seen better days the mayor and his wife for
they had a mayor there among other unnecessaries the justice of the peace the widow douglass fair smart and forty a generous good hearted soul and well to do her hill mansion the only palace in the town and the most hospitable and much the most lavish in the matter of festivities that st petersburg could boast the bent and venerable major and mrs ward lawyer riverson the new notable from a distance next the belle of the village followed by a troop of lawn clad and ribbon decked young heart breakers then all the young clerks in town in a body for they had stood in the vestibule sucking their cane heads a circling wall of oiled and simpering admirers till the last girl had run their gantlet and last of all came the model boy willie mufferson taking as heedful care of his mother as if she were cut glass
aunt_polly came and tom_sawyer and sid and mary sat with her he always brought his mother to church and was the pride of all the matrons
the boy all hated him he was so good and besides he had been thrown up to them so much his white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind as usual on sundays accidentally
the congregation being fully assembled now the bell rang once more to warn laggards and stragglers and then a solemn hush fell upon the church which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of the choir in the gallery
tom_sawyer had no handkerchief and he looked upon boy who had as snobs the choir always tittered and whispered all through service
it was a great many years ago and i can scarcely remember anything about it but i think it was in some foreign country
the minister gave out the hymn and read it through with a relish in a peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country
his voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reached a certain point where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmost word and then plunged down as if from a spring board shall
there was once a church choir that was not ill bred but i have forgotten where it was now i be car ri ed toe the skies on flow ry beds of ease
at church sociables he was always called upon to read poetry and when he was through the ladies would lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their laps and wall their eyes and shake their heads as much as to say
whilst others fight to win the prize and sail thro blood seas he was regarded as a wonderful reader words cannot express it it is too beautiful too beautiful for this mortal earth
after the hymn had been sung the rev mr sprague turned himself into a bulletin board and read off notices of meetings and societies and thing till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack of doom a queer custom which is still kept up in america even in cities away here in this age of abundant newspapers
often the less there is to justify a traditional custom the harder it is to get rid of it and now the minister prayed
a good generous prayer it was and went into details it pleaded for the church and the little children of the church for the other churches of the village for the village itself for the county for the state for the state officers for the united states for the churches of the united states for congress for the president for the officers of the government for poor sailors tossed by stormy seas for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel of european monarchies and oriental despotisms for such as have the light and the good tidings and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hear withal for the heathen in the far islands of the sea and closed with a supplication that the words he was about to speak might find grace and favor and be as seed sown in fertile ground yielding in time a grateful harvest of good
the boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayer he only endured it if he even did that much
he was restive all through it he kept tally of the details of the prayer unconsciously for he was not listening but he knew the ground of old and the clergyman regular route over it and when a little trifle of new matter was interlarded his ear detected it and his whole nature resented it he considered additions unfair and scoundrelly
in the midst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front of him and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands together embracing its head with its arms and polishing it so vigorously that it seemed to almost part company with the body and the slender thread of a neck was exposed to view scraping its wings with its hind legs and smoothing them to its body as if they had been coat tails going through its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectly safe
as indeed it was for as sorely as tom_sawyer hands itched to grab for it they did not dare he believed his soul would be instantly destroyed if he did such a thing while the prayer was going on
amen there was a rustling of dresses and the standing congregation sat down but with the closing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward and the instant the amen was out
the minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously through an argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstone and thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to be hardly worth the saving
tom_sawyer counted the pages of the sermon after church he always knew how many pages there had been but he seldom knew anything else about the discourse
the fly was a prisoner of war his aunt detected the act and made him let it go however this time he was really interested for a little while
the minister made a grand and moving picture of the assembling together of the world hosts at the millennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and a little child should lead them
but the pathos the lesson the moral of the great spectacle were lost upon the boy he only thought of the conspicuousness of the principal character before the on looking nations his face lit with the thought and he said to himself that he wished he could be that child if it was a tame lion
now he lapsed into suffering again as the dry argument was resumed presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out
it was a large black beetle with formidable jaws a pinchbug he called it it was in a percussion cap box the first thing the beetle did was to take him by the finger
a natural fillip followed the beetle went floundering into the aisle and lit on its back and the hurt finger went into the boy mouth
the beetle lay there working its helpless legs unable to turn over tom_sawyer eyed it and longed for it but it was safe out of his reach
presently a vagrant poodle dog came idling along sad at heart lazy with the summer softness and the quiet weary of captivity sighing for change
other people uninterested in the sermon found relief in the beetle and they eyed it too he spied the beetle the drooping tail lifted and wagged
he surveyed the prize walked around it smelt at it from a safe distance walked around it again grew bolder and took a closer smell then lifted his lip and made a gingerly snatch at it just missing it made another and another began to enjoy the diversion subsided to his stomach with the beetle between his paws and continued his experiments grew weary at last and then indifferent and absent minded
there was a sharp yelp a flirt of the poodle head and the beetle fell a couple of yards away and lit on its back once more
the neighboring spectators shook with a gentle inward joy several faces went behind fans and hand kerchiefs and tom_sawyer was entirely happy
the dog looked foolish and probably felt so but there was resentment in his heart too and a craving for revenge
so he went to the beetle and began a wary attack on it again jumping at it from every point of a circle lighting with his fore paws within an inch of the creature making even closer snatches at it with his teeth and jerking his head till his ears flapped again
but he grew tired once more after a while tried to amuse himself with a fly but found no relief followed an ant around with his nose close to the floor and quickly wearied of that yawned sighed forgot the beetle entirely and sat down on it
then there was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up the aisle the yelps continued and so did the dog
he crossed the house in front of the altar he flew down the other aisle he crossed before the doors he clamored up the home stretch his anguish grew with his progress till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbit with the gleam and the speed of light
at last the frantic sufferer sheered from its course and sprang into its master lap he flung it out of the window and the voice of distress quickly thinned away and died in the distance
by this time the whole church was red faced and suffocating with suppressed laughter and the sermon had come to a dead standstill
the discourse was resumed presently but it went lame and halting all possibility of impressiveness being at an end for even the gravest sentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst of unholy mirth under cover of some remote pew back as if the poor parson had said a rarely facetious thing
his head nodded and little by little his chin descended and touched the enemy who seized it it was a genuine relief to the whole congregation when the ordeal was over and the benediction pronounced
tom_sawyer went home quite cheerful thinking to himself that there was some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit of variety in it
he had but one marring thought he was willing that the dog should play with his pinchbug but he did not think it was upright in him to carry it off
chapter vi monday morning found tom_sawyer miserable monday morning always found him so because it began another week slow suffering in school
he generally began that day with wishing he had had no intervening holiday it made the going into captivity and fetters again so much more odious
tom_sawyer lay thinking presently it occurred to him that he wished he was sick then he could stay home from school
here was a vague possibility he canvassed his system no ailment was found and he investigated again this time he thought he could detect colicky symptoms and he began to encourage them with considerable hope
but they soon grew feeble and presently died wholly away he reflected further suddenly he discovered something one of his upper front teeth was loose
this was lucky he was about to begin to groan as a starter as he called it when it occurred to him that if he came into court with that argument his aunt would pull it out and that would hurt
nothing offered for some little time and then he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain thing that laid up a patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make him lose a finger
so he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for the present and seek further so the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under the sheet and held it up for inspection
but now he did not know the necessary symptoms however it seemed well worth while to chance it so he fell to groaning with considerable spirit
but sid slept on unconscious tom_sawyer groaned louder and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe no result from sid
tom_sawyer was panting with his exertions by this time he took a rest and then swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans
sid snored on tom_sawyer was aggravated he said sid sid and shook him this course worked well and tom_sawyer began to groan again
sid yawned stretched then brought himself up on his elbow with a snort and began to stare at tom_sawyer tom went on groaning
sid said tom_sawyer say tom_sawyer no response here tom_sawyer tom what is the matter tom_sawyer and he shook him and looked in his face anxiously
tom_sawyer moaned out oh dont sid dont joggle me why what the matter tom_sawyer i must call auntie no never mind
it ll be over by and by maybe dont call anybody but i must dont groan so tom_sawyer it awful how long you been this way
hours ouch oh dont stir so sid you ll kill me tom_sawyer why didnt you wake me sooner oh tom_sawyer dont
it makes my flesh crawl to hear you tom_sawyer what is the matter i forgive you everything sid groan everything you ve ever done to me
when i gone oh tom_sawyer you aint dying are you dont tom_sawyer oh dont maybe i forgive everybody sid
and sid you give my window sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl that come to town and tell her
tom_sawyer was suffering in reality now so handsomely was his imagination working and so his groans had gathered quite a genuine tone
groan tell em so sid but sid had snatched his clothes and gone sid flew downstairs and said oh aunt_polly come
tom_sawyer dying dying yes dont wait come quick rubbage i dont believe it but she fled upstairs nevertheless with sid and mary at her heels
and her face grew white too and her lip trembled when she reached the bedside she gasped out you tom_sawyer tom what the matter with you
oh auntie i what the matter with you what is the matter with you child oh auntie my sore toe mortified
the old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little then cried a little then did both together
this restored her and she said tom_sawyer what a turn you did give me now you shut up that nonsense and climb out of this
the boy felt a little foolish and he said aunt_polly it seemed mortified and it hurt so i never minded my tooth at all
the groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe your tooth indeed what the matter with your tooth
one of them loose and it aches perfectly awful there there now dont begin that groaning again open your mouth
well your tooth is loose but you re not going to die about that mary get me a silk thread and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen
tom_sawyer said oh please auntie dont pull it out it dont hurt any more i wish i may never stir if it does
please dont auntie i dont want to stay home from school oh you dont dont you so all this row was because you thought you get to stay home from school and go a fishing
tom_sawyer tom i love you so and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heart with your outrageousness
the old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to tom_sawyer tooth with a loop and tied the other to the bedpost
by this time the dental instruments were ready then she seized the chunk of fire and suddenly thrust it almost into the boy face
the tooth hung dangling by the bedpost now but all trials bring their compensations as tom_sawyer wended to school after breakfast he was the envy of every boy
he met because the gap in his upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new and admirable way
he gathered quite a following of lads interested in the exhibition and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre of fascination and homage up to this time now found himself suddenly without an adherent and shorn of his glory
his heart was heavy and he said with a disdain which he did not feel that it wasnt anything to spit like tom_sawyer but another boy said sour grapes and he wandered away a dismantled hero
huckleberry_finn was cordially hated and dreaded by all the mothers of the town because he was idle and lawless and vulgar and bad and because all their children admired him so and delighted in his forbidden society and wished they dared to be like him
tom_sawyer was like the rest of the respectable boy in that he envied huckleberry_finn his gaudy outcast condition and was under strict orders not to play with him
shortly tom_sawyer came upon the juvenile pariah of the village huckleberry_finn son of the town drunkard so he played with him every time he got a chance
huckleberry_finn was always dressed in the cast off clothes of full grown men and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags
his hat was a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim his coat when he wore one hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttons far down the back but one suspender supported his trousers the seat of the trousers bagged low and contained nothing the fringed legs dragged in the dirt when not rolled up
he slept on doorsteps in fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet he did not have to go to school or to church or call any being master or obey anybody he could go fishing or swimming when and where he chose and stay as long as it suited him nobody forbade him to fight he could sit up as late as he pleased he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the spring and the last to resume leather in the fall he never had to wash nor put on clean clothes he could swear wonderfully
huckleberry_finn came and went at his own free will in a word everything that goes to make life precious that boy had
so thought every harassed hampered respectable boy in st petersburg tom_sawyer hailed the romantic outcast hello huckleberry_finn hello yourself and see how you like it
what that you got dead cat lemme see him huck_finn my he pretty stiff where you get him
bought him off a boy what did you give i give a blue ticket and a bladder that i got at the slaughter house
where you get the blue ticket bought it off ben_rogers two weeks ago for a hoop stick say what is dead cats good for huck_finn
good for cure warts with no is that so i know something that better i bet you dont what is it
why spunk water spunk water i wouldnt give a dern for spunk water you wouldnt wouldnt you you ever try it no i haint
why he told jeff_thatcher becky_thatcher and jeff_thatcher told johnny baker and johnny told jim_hollis and jim_hollis told ben_rogers and ben_rogers told a nigger and the nigger told me
but bob tanner did who told you so there now well what of it they ll all lie
leastways all but the nigger i dont know him but i never see a nigger that wouldnt lie shucks now you tell me how bob tanner done it huck_finn
why he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where the rain water was in the daytime certainly with his face to the stump
yes least i reckon so did he say anything i dont reckon he did i dont know aha
talk about trying to cure warts with spunk water such a blame fool way as that why that aint a going to do any good
you got to go all by yourself to the middle of the woods where you know there a spunk water stump and just as it midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say barley corn barley corn injun meal shorts spunk water spunk water swaller these warts and then walk away quick eleven steps with your eyes shut and then turn around three time and walk home without speaking to anybody
because if you speak the charm busted well that sounds like a good way but that aint the way bob tanner done
he the wartiest boy in this town and he wouldnt have a wart on him if he knowed how to work spunk water
no sir you can bet he didnt becuz i ve took off thousands of warts off of my hands that way huck_finn
i play with frogs so much that i ve always got considerable many warts sometimes i take em off with a bean
you take and split the bean and cut the wart so as to get some blood and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take and dig a hole and bury it bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark of the moon and then you burn up the rest of the bean
you see that piece that got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing trying to fetch the other piece to it and so that helps the blood to draw the wart and pretty soon off she comes
yes bean good i ve done that have you what your way yes that it huck_finn that it though
when you re burying it if you say down bean off wart come no more to bother me it better that the way joe_harper does and he been nearly to coonville and most everywheres
why you take your cat and go and get in the grave yard long about midnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried and when it midnight a devil will come or maybe two or three but you cant see em you can only hear something like the wind or maybe hear em talk and when they re taking that feller away you heave your cat after em and say devil follow corpse cat follow devil warts follow cat i done with ye
but say how do you cure em with dead cats that ll fetch any wart sounds right you ever try it huck_finn
no but old mother hopkins told me well i reckon it so then becuz they say she a witch say
he come along one day and he see she was a witching him so he took up a rock and if she hadnt dodged he a got her
why tom_sawyer i know she is she witched pap pap says so his own self well that very night he rolled off a shed wher he was a layin drunk and broke his arm
why that awful how did he know she was a witching him lord pap can tell easy pap says when they keep looking at you right stiddy they re a witching you
specially if they mumble becuz when they mumble they re saying the lord prayer backards say hucky when you going to try the cat
to night i reckon they ll come after old hoss williams to night but they buried him saturday didnt they get him saturday night
why how you talk how could their charms work till midnight and then it sunday devils dont slosh around much of a sunday i dont reckon
i never thought of that that so lemme go with you of course if you aint afeard afeard taint likely
last time you kep me a meowing around till old hays went to throwing rocks at me and says dern that cat
will you meow yes and you meow back if you get a chance and so i hove a brick through his window but dont you tell
i wont i couldnt meow that night becuz auntie was watching me but i ll meow this time say what that nothing but a tick
where you get him out in the woods what ll you take for him i dont know i dont want to sell him
all right it a mighty small tick anyway oh anybody can run a tick down that dont belong to them
i satisfied with it it a good enough tick for me sho there ticks a plenty i could have a thousand of em if i wanted to
well why dont you becuz you know mighty well you cant this is a pretty early tick i reckon it the first one i ve seen this year
say huck_finn i ll give you my tooth for him less see it tom_sawyer got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it
huckleberry_finn viewed it wistfully the temptation was very strong at last he said is it genuwyne tom_sawyer lifted his lip and showed the vacancy
tom_sawyer enclosed the tick in the percussion cap box that had lately been the pinchbug prison and the boy separated each feeling wealthier than before
when tom_sawyer reached the little isolated frame school house he strode in briskly with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed
well all right said huckleberry_finn it a trade he hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat with business like alacrity
the master throned on high in his great splint bottom arm chair was dozing lulled by the drowsy hum of study the interruption roused him
thomas_sawyer tom_sawyer knew that when his name was pronounced in full it meant trouble sir come up here
tom_sawyer was about to take refuge in a lie when he saw two long tails of yellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electric sympathy of love and by that form was the only vacant place on the girl side of the school house
now sir why are you late again as usual he instantly said i stopped to talk with huckleberry_finn
the master pulse stood still and he stared helplessly the buzz of study ceased the pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost his mind
the master said you you did what stopped to talk with huckleberry_finn there was no mistaking the words thomas_sawyer this is the most astounding confession i have ever listened to
no mere ferule will answer for this offence take off your jacket the master arm performed until it was tired and the stock of switches notably diminished
then the order followed now sir go and sit with the girl and let this be a warning to you
the titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy but in reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe of his unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high good fortune
he sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girl hitched herself away from him with a toss of her head
nudges and winks and whispers traversed the room but tom_sawyer sat still with his arms upon the long low desk before him and seemed to study his book
by and by attention ceased from him and the accustomed school murmur rose upon the dull air once more presently the boy began to steal furtive glances at the girl
she observed it made a mouth at him and gave him the back of her head for the space of a minute
when she cautiously faced around again a peach lay before her she thrust it away tom_sawyer gently put it back she thrust it away again but with less animosity
tom_sawyer patiently returned it to its place then she let it remain tom_sawyer scrawled on his slate please take it i got more
the girl glanced at the words but made no sign now the boy began to draw something on the slate hiding his work with his left hand
for a time the girl refused to notice but her human curiosity presently began to manifest itself by hardly perceptible signs
the girl made a sort of non committal attempt to see but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it
tom_sawyer partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gable ends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney
the boy worked on apparently unconscious at last she gave in and hesitatingly whispered let me see it then the girl interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgot everything else
when it was finished she gazed a moment then whispered it nice make a man the artist erected a man in the front yard that resembled a derrick
he could have stepped over the house but the girl was not hypercritical she was satisfied with the monster and whispered it a beautiful man now make me coming along
tom_sawyer drew an hour glass with a full moon and straw limbs to it and armed the spreading fingers with a portentous fan
the girl said it ever so nice i wish i could draw it easy whispered tom_sawyer i ll learn you oh will you
when at noon do you go home to dinner i ll stay if you will good that a whack what your name becky_thatcher
what yours oh i know it thomas_sawyer that the name they lick me by i tom_sawyer when i good
you call me tom_sawyer will you yes now tom_sawyer began to scrawl something on the slate hiding the words from the girl
but she was not backward this time she begged to see tom_sawyer said oh it aint anything yes it is
no it aint you dont want to see yes i do indeed i do please let me
you ll tell no i wont deed and deed and double deed wont you wont tell anybody at all ever as long as you live
no i wont ever tell any body now let me oh you dont want to see now that you treat me so i will see
and she put her small hand upon his and a little scuffle ensued tom_sawyer pretending to resist in earnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words were revealed i love you
oh you bad thing and she hit his hand a smart rap but reddened and looked pleased nevertheless
in that wise he was borne across the house and deposited in his own seat under a peppering fire of giggles from the whole school
then the master stood over him during a few awful moments and finally moved away to his throne without saying a word
just at this juncture the boy felt a slow fateful grip closing on his ear and a steady lifting impulse but although tom_sawyer ear tingled his heart was jubilant
in turn he took his place in the reading class and made a botch of it then in the geography class and turned lakes into mountains mountains into rivers and rivers into continents till chaos was come again then in the spelling class and got turned down by a succession of mere baby words till he brought up at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn with ostentation for months
as the school quieted down tom_sawyer made an honest effort to study but the turmoil within him was too great chapter vii
the harder tom_sawyer tried to fasten his mind on his book the more his ideas wandered so at last with a sigh and a yawn he gave it up
it seemed to him that the noon recess would never come the air was utterly dead there was not a breath stirring
the drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studying scholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees
away off in the flaming sunshine cardiff hill lifted its soft green sides through a shimmering veil of heat tinted with the purple of distance a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air no other living thing was visible but some cows and they were asleep
it was the sleepiest of sleepy days tom_sawyer heart ached to be free or else to have something of interest to do to pass the dreary time
his hand wandered into his pocket and his face lit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer though he did not know it
the creature probably glowed with a gratitude that amounted to prayer too at this moment but it was premature for when he started thankfully to travel off tom_sawyer turned him aside with a pin and made him take a new direction
tom_sawyer bosom friend sat next him suffering just as tom_sawyer had been and now he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in an instant
then furtively the percussion cap box came out he released the tick and put him on the long flat desk this bosom friend was joe_harper
the two boy were sworn friends all the week and embattled enemies on saturdays joe_harper took a pin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner
the sport grew in interest momently soon tom_sawyer said that they were interfering with each other and neither getting the fullest benefit of the tick
so he put joe_harper slate on the desk and drew a line down the middle of it from top to bottom
now said he as long as he is on your side you can stir him up and i ll let him alone but if you let him get away and get on my side you re to leave him alone as long as i can keep him from crossing over
all right go ahead start him up the tick escaped from tom_sawyer presently and crossed the equator joe_harper harassed him awhile and then he got away and crossed back again
while one boy was worrying the tick with absorbing interest the other would look on with interest as strong the two heads bowed together over the slate and the two soul dead to all thing else
the tick tried this that and the other course and got as excited and as anxious as the boy themselves but time and again just as he would have victory in his very grasp so to speak and tom_sawyer fingers would be twitching to begin joe_harper pin would deftly head him off and keep possession
this change of base occurred often at last luck seemed to settle and abide with joe_harper at last tom_sawyer could stand it no longer
the temptation was too strong so he reached out and lent a hand with his pin joe_harper was angry in a moment
said he tom_sawyer you let him alone i only just want to stir him up a little joe_harper no sir it aint fair you just let him alone
blame it i aint going to stir him much let him alone i tell you i wont you shall he on my side of the line
look here joe_harper whose is that tick i dont care whose tick he is he on my side of the line and you sha nt touch him
well i ll just bet i will though he my tick and i ll do what i blame please with him or die
a tremendous whack came down on tom_sawyer shoulders and its duplicate on joe_harper and for the space of two minute the dust continued to fly from the two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it
the boy had been too absorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhile before when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood over them
he had contemplated a good part of the performance before he contributed his bit of variety to it when school broke up at noon tom_sawyer flew to becky_thatcher and whispered in her ear
put on your bonnet and let on you re going home and when you get to the corner give the rest of em the slip and turn down through the lane and come back
i ll go the other way and come it over em the same way so the one went off with one group of scholars and the other with another
in a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane and when they reached the school they had it all to themselves
then they sat together with a slate before them and tom_sawyer gave becky_thatcher the pencil and held her hand in his guiding it and so created another surprising house
when the interest in art began to wane the two fell to talking tom_sawyer was swimming in bliss he said do you love rats
no i hate them well i do too live ones but i mean dead ones to swing round your head with a string
no i dont care for rats much anyway what i like is chewing gum oh i should say so i wish i had some now
do you i ve got some i ll let you chew it awhile but you must give it back to me
that was agreeable so they chewed it turn about and dangled their legs against the bench in excess of contentment
was you ever at a circus said tom_sawyer yes and my pa going to take me again some time if i good
i been to the circus three or four time lots of time church aint shucks to a circus there thing going on at a circus all the time
i going to be a clown in a circus when i grow up oh are you that will be nice
they re so lovely all spotted up yes that so and they get slathers of money most a dollar a day ben_rogers says
say becky_thatcher was you ever engaged what that why engaged to be married no would you like to
you only just tell a boy you wont ever have anybody but him ever ever ever and then you kiss and
i reckon so i dont know what is it like like why it aint like anything that all anybody can do it
kiss what do you kiss for why that you know is to well they always do that everybody why yes everybody that in love with each other
do you remember what i wrote on the slate ye yes what was it i sha nt tell you shall i tell you
ye yes but some other time no now no not now to morrow oh no now please becky_thatcher i ll whisper it
becky_thatcher hesitating tom_sawyer took silence for consent and passed his arm about her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly with his mouth close to her ear
i ll whisper it ever so easy and then he added now you whisper it to me just the same
she resisted for a while and then said you turn your face away so you cant see and then i will
but you mustnt ever tell anybody will you tom_sawyer now you wont will you no indeed indeed i wont now becky_thatcher
then she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and benches with tom_sawyer after her and took refuge in a corner at last with her little white apron to her face
he turned his face away she bent timidly around till her breath stirred his curls and whispered i love you tom_sawyer clasped her about her neck and pleaded now becky_thatcher it all done all over but the kiss
dont you be afraid of that it aint anything at all please becky_thatcher and he tugged at her apron and the hands
by and by she gave up and let her hands drop her face all glowing with the struggle came up and submitted
and always after this you know you aint ever to love anybody but me and you aint ever to marry anybody but me ever never and forever
no i ll never love anybody but you tom_sawyer and i ll never marry anybody but you and you aint to ever marry anybody but me either
tom_sawyer kissed the red lips and said now it all done becky_thatcher will you certainly of course that part of it
and always coming to school or when we re going home you re to walk with me when there aint anybody looking and you choose me and i choose you at parties because that the way you do when you re engaged
it so nice i never heard of it before oh it ever so gay why me and amy_lawrence the big eyes told tom_sawyer his blunder and he stopped confused
oh tom_sawyer then i aint the first you ve ever been engaged to the child began to cry tom_sawyer said oh dont cry becky_thatcher i dont care for her any more
tom_sawyer tried to put his arm about her neck but she pushed him away and turned her face to the wall and went on crying
yes you do tom_sawyer you know you do tom_sawyer tried again with soothing words in his mouth and was repulsed again
he stood about restless and uneasy for a while glancing at the door every now and then hoping she would repent and come to find him
then his pride was up and he strode away and went outside but she did not then he began to feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong
it was a hard struggle with him to make new advances now but he nerved himself to it and entered she was still standing back there in the corner sobbing with her face to the wall
tom_sawyer heart smote him he went to her and stood a moment not knowing exactly how to proceed then he said hesitatingly becky_thatcher i i dont care for anybody but you
tom_sawyer got out his chiefest jewel a brass knob from the top of an andiron and passed it around her so that she could see it and said please becky_thatcher wont you take it
no reply but sobs becky_thatcher pleadingly becky_thatcher wont you say something more sobs she struck it to the floor
then tom_sawyer marched out of the house and over the hills and far away to return to school no more that day
presently becky_thatcher began to suspect she ran to the door he was not in sight she flew around to the play yard he was not there
then she called tom_sawyer come back tom_sawyer she listened intently but there was no answer she had no companions but silence and loneliness
so she sat down to cry again and upbraid herself and by this time the scholars began to gather again and she had to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the cross of a long dreary aching afternoon with none among the strangers about her to exchange sorrows with
chapter viii tom_sawyer dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out of the track of returning scholars and then fell into a moody jog
he crossed a small branch two or three time because of a prevailing juvenile superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit
half an hour later he was disappearing behind the douglas mansion on the summit of cardiff hill and the school house was hardly distinguishable away off in the valley behind him
he entered a dense wood picked his pathless way to the centre of it and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreading oak
there was not even a zephyr stirring the dead noonday heat had even stilled the songs of the birds nature lay in a trance that was broken by no sound but the occasional far off hammering of a wood pecker and this seemed to render the pervading silence and sense of loneliness the more profound
the boy soul was steeped in melancholy his feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings he sat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his hands meditating
it seemed to him that life was but a trouble at best and he more than half envied jimmy hodges so lately released it must be very peaceful he thought to lie and slumber and dream forever and ever with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing the grass and the flowers over the grave and nothing to bother and grieve about ever any more
if he only had a clean sunday school record he could be willing to go and be done with it all now as to this girl
what had he done nothing he had meant the best in the world and been treated like a dog like a very dog
she would be sorry some day maybe when it was too late ah if he could only die temporarily but the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into one constrained shape long at a time
tom_sawyer presently began to drift insensibly back into the concerns of this life again what if he turned his back now and disappeared mysteriously
what if he went away ever so far away into unknown countries beyond the seas and never came back any more how would she feel then
for frivolity and jokes and spotted tights were an offense when they intruded themselves upon a spirit that was exalted into the vague august realm of the romantic
the idea of being a clown recurred to him now only to fill him with disgust no he would be a soldier and return after long years all war worn and illustrious
no better still he would join the indians and hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the mountain ranges and the trackless great plains of the far west and away in the future come back a great chief bristling with feathers hideous with paint and prance into sunday school some drowsy summer morning with a blood curdling war whoop and sear the eyeballs of all his companions with unappeasable envy
but no there was something gaudier even than this he would be a pirate that was it now his future lay plain before him and glowing with unimaginable splendor
how gloriously he would go plowing the dancing seas in his long low black hulled racer the spirit of the storm with his grisly flag flying at the fore
and at the zenith of his fame how he would suddenly appear at the old village and stalk into church brown and weather beaten in his black velvet doublet and trunks his great jack boots his crimson sash his belt bristling with horse pistols his crime rusted cutlass at his side his slouch hat with waving plumes his black flag unfurled with the skull and crossbones on it and hear with swelling ecstasy the whisperings it tom_sawyer the pirate the black avenger of the spanish main
how his name would fill the world and make people shudder yes it was settled his career was determined he would run away from home and enter upon it
he would start the very next morning therefore he must now begin to get ready he would collect his resources together
he went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig under one end of it with his barlow knife
he soon struck wood that sounded hollow he put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressively what hasnt come here come
what here stay here then he scraped away the dirt and exposed a pine shingle he took it up and disclosed a shapely little treasure house whose bottom and sides were of shingles
in it lay a marble tom_sawyer astonishment was bound less he scratched his head with a perplexed air and said well that beats anything
the truth was that a superstition of his had failed here which he and all his comrades had always looked upon as infallible
if you buried a marble with certain necessary incantations and left it alone a fortnight and then opened the place with the incantation he had just used you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost had gathered themselves together there meantime no matter how widely they had been separated
then he tossed the marble away pettishly and stood cogitating but now this thing had actually and unquestionably failed tom_sawyer whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations
it did not occur to him that he had tried it several time before himself but could never find the hiding places afterward
he had many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of its failing before he puzzled over the matter some time and finally decided that some witch had interfered and broken the charm
he thought he would satisfy himself on that point so he searched around till he found a small sandy spot with a little funnel shaped depression in it
he laid himself down and put his mouth close to this depression and called doodle bug doodle bug tell me what i want to know
the sand began to work and presently a small black bug appeared for a second and then darted under again in a fright
doodle bug doodle bug tell me what i want to know he dasnt tell so it was a witch that done it
i just knowed it he well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches so he gave up discouraged
but it occurred to him that he might as well have the marble he had just thrown away and therefore he went and made a patient search for it
now he went back to his treasure house and carefully placed himself just as he had been standing when he tossed the marble away then he took another marble from his pocket and tossed it in the same way saying brother go find your brother
but he could not find it he watched where it stopped and went there and looked but it must have fallen short or gone too far so he tried twice more
the last repetition was successful the two marbles lay within a foot of each other just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the green aisles of the forest
tom_sawyer flung off his jacket and trousers turned a suspender into a belt raked away some brush behind the rotten log disclosing a rude bow and arrow a lath sword and a tin trumpet and in a moment had seized these thing and bounded away barelegged with fluttering shirt
he presently halted under a great elm blew an answering blast and then began to tiptoe and look warily out this way and that
he said cautiously to an imaginary company hold my merry men keep hid till i blow now appeared joe_harper as airily clad and elaborately armed as tom_sawyer
tom_sawyer called hold who comes here into sherwood forest without my pass guy of guisborne wants no man pass who art thou that
that dares to hold such language said tom_sawyer prompting for they talked by the book from memory who art thou that dares to hold such language
i indeed i am robin hood as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know then art thou indeed that famous outlaw
they took their lath swords dumped their other traps on the ground struck a fencing attitude foot to foot and began a grave careful combat two up and two down
right gladly will i dispute with thee the passes of the merry wood have at thee presently tom_sawyer said now if you ve got the hang go it lively
so they went it lively panting and perspiring with the work by and by tom_sawyer shouted fall fall why dont you fall
i sha nt why dont you fall yourself you re getting the worst of it why that aint anything i cant fall that aint the way it is in the book
the book says then with one back handed stroke he slew poor guy of guisborne you re to turn around and let me hit you in the back
there was no getting around the authorities so joe_harper turned received the whack and fell now said joe_harper getting up you got to let me kill you
well say joe_harper you can be friar tuck or much the miller son and lam me with a quarter staff or i ll be the sheriff of nottingham
that fair why i cant do that it aint in the book well it blamed mean that all and you be robin hood a little while and kill me
then tom_sawyer became robin hood again and was allowed by the treacherous nun to bleed his strength away through his neglected wound
and at last joe_harper representing a whole tribe of weeping outlaws dragged him sadly forth gave his bow into his feeble hands and tom_sawyer said where this arrow falls there bury poor robin hood under the greenwood tree
then he shot the arrow and fell back and would have died but he lit on a nettle and sprang up too gaily for a corpse
the boy dressed themselves hid their accoutrements and went off grieving that there were no outlaws any more and wondering what modern civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss
this was satisfactory and so these adventures were carried out they said they would rather be outlaws a year in sherwood forest than president of the united states forever
chapter ix at half past nine that night tom_sawyer and sid were sent to bed as usual they said their prayers and sid was soon asleep
tom_sawyer lay awake and waited in restless impatience when it seemed to him that it must be nearly daylight he heard the clock strike ten
this was despair he would have tossed and fidgeted as his nerves demanded but he was afraid he might wake sid
so he lay still and stared up into the dark everything was dismally still by and by out of the stillness little scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves
the ticking of the clock began to bring itself into notice old beams began to crack mysteriously the stairs creaked faintly
evidently spirits were abroad a measured muffled snore issued from aunt_polly chamber and now the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate began
next the ghastly ticking of a death watch in the wall at the bed head made tom_sawyer shudder it meant that somebody days were numbered
then the howl of a far off dog rose on the night air and was answered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance
at last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun he began to doze in spite of himself the clock chimed eleven but he did not hear it
tom_sawyer was in an agony and then there came mingling with his half formed dreams a most melancholy caterwauling the raising of a neighboring window disturbed him
a cry of scat you devil and the crash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunt woodshed brought him wide awake and a single minute later he was dressed and out of the window and creeping along the roof of the ell on all fours
he meow with caution once or twice as he went then jumped to the roof of the woodshed and thence to the ground
huckleberry_finn was there with his dead cat the boy moved off and disappeared in the gloom at the end of half an hour they were wading through the tall grass of the graveyard
it was a graveyard of the old fashioned western kind it was on a hill about a mile and a half from the village
it had a crazy board fence around it which leaned inward in places and outward the rest of the time but stood upright nowhere
all the old graves were sunken in there was not a tombstone on the place round topped worm eaten boards staggered over the graves leaning for support and finding none
sacred to the memory of so and so had been painted on them once but it could no longer have been read on the most of them now even if there had been light
a faint wind moaned through the trees and tom_sawyer feared it might be the spirits of the dead complaining at being disturbed
the boy talked little and only under their breath for the time and the place and the pervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits
they found the sharp new heap they were seeking and ensconced themselves within the protection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feet of the grave
grass and weeds grew rank over the whole cemetery then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time the hooting of a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness
tom_sawyer reflections grew oppressive he must force some talk so he said in a whisper hucky do you believe the dead people like it for us to be here
huckleberry_finn whispered i wisht i knowed it awful solemn like aint it i bet it is there was a considerable pause while the boy canvassed this matter inwardly
then tom_sawyer whispered say hucky do you reckon hoss williams hears us talking course he does least his sperrit does
tom_sawyer after a pause i wish i said mister williams but i never meant any harm everybody calls him hoss a body cant be too partic lar how they talk bout these yer dead people tom_sawyer
this was a damper and conversation died again presently tom_sawyer seized his comrade arm and said sh what is it tom_sawyer
and the two clung together with beating heart sh there tis again didnt you hear it i there
now you hear it lord tom_sawyer they re coming they re coming sure what ll we do i dono think they ll see us
oh tom_sawyer they can see in the dark same as cats i wisht i hadnt come oh dont be afeard
i dont believe they ll bother us we aint doing any harm if we keep perfectly still maybe they wont notice us at all
i ll try to tom_sawyer but lord i all of a shiver listen the boy bent their heads together and scarcely breathed
a muffled sound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard look see there whispered tom_sawyer
some vague figures approached through the gloom swinging an old fashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerable little spangles of light
what is it it devil fire oh tom_sawyer this is awful presently huckleberry_finn whispered with a shudder it the devils sure enough
three of em lordy tom_sawyer we re goners can you pray i ll try but dont you be afeard they aint going to hurt us
now i lay me down to sleep i sh what is it huck_finn they re humans one of em is anyway

he aint sharp enough to notice us drunk the same as usual likely blamed old rip all right i ll keep still
now they re stuck cant find it here they come again now they re hot cold again hot again red hot they re inted right this time
say huck_finn i know another them voices it injun joe_harper that so that murderin half breed i druther they was devils a dern sight
the whisper died wholly out now for the three men had reached the grave and stood within a few feet of the boy hiding place
here it is said the third voice and the owner of it held the lantern up and revealed the face of young doctor robinson
what kin they be up to muff_potter and injun joe_harper were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and a couple of shovels on it
the doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and came and sat down with his back against one of the elm trees
they cast down their load and began to open the grave he was so close the boy could have touched him
hurry men he said in a low voice the moon might come out at any moment they growled a response and went on digging
for some time there was no noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freight of mould and gravel
finally a spade struck upon the coffin with a dull woody accent and within another minute or two the men had hoisted it out on the ground
it was very monotonous they pried off the lid with their shovels got out the body and dumped it rudely on the ground
the barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it covered with a blanket and bound to its place with the rope
muff_potter took out a large spring knife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and then said now the cussed thing ready sawbones and you ll just out with another five or here she stays
the moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallid face that the talk said injun joe_harper
look here what does this mean said the doctor you required your pay in advance and i ve paid you
five years ago you drove me away from your father kitchen one night when i come to ask for something to eat and you said i warnt there for any good and when i swore i get even with you if it took a hundred years your father had me jailed for a vagrant
yes and you done more than that said injun joe_harper approaching the doctor who was now standing did you think i forget
the injun blood aint in me for nothing and now i ve got you and you got to settle you know
he was threatening the doctor with his fist in his face by this time the doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on the ground
muff_potter dropped his knife and exclaimed here now dont you hit my pard and the next moment he had grappled with the doctor and the two were struggling with might and main trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels
injun joe_harper sprang to his feet his eyes flaming with passion snatched up muff_potter knife and went creeping catlike and stooping round and round about the combatants seeking an opportunity
all at once the doctor flung himself free seized the heavy headboard of williams grave and felled muff_potter to the earth with it and in the same instant the half breed saw his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in the young man breast
he reeled and fell partly upon muff_potter flooding him with his blood and in the same moment the clouds blotted out the dreadful spectacle and the two frightened boy went speeding away in the dark
presently when the moon emerged again injun joe_harper was standing over the two forms contemplating them the doctor murmured inarticulately gave a long gasp or two and was still
the half breed muttered that score is settled damn you then he robbed the body after which he put the fatal knife in muff_potter open right hand and sat down on the dismantled coffin
three four five minute passed and then muff_potter began to stir and moan his hand closed upon the knife he raised it glanced at it and let it fall with a shudder
then he sat up pushing the body from him and gazed at it and then around him confusedly his eyes met joe_harper
lord how is this joe_harper he said it a dirty business said joe_harper without moving what did you do it for
i i never done it look here that kind of talk wont wash muff_potter trembled and grew white i thought i got sober
i no business to drink to night but it in my head yet worse when we started here i all in a muddle cant recollect anything of it hardly
tell me joe_harper honest now old feller did i do it joe_harper i never meant to pon my soul and honor i never meant to joe_harper
tell me how it was joe_harper oh it awful and him so young and promising why you two was scuffling and he fetched you one with the headboard
and then up you come all reeling and staggering like and snatched the knife and jammed it into him just as he fetched you another awful clip and here you ve laid as dead as a wedge til now
and you fell flat oh i didnt know what i was a doing i wish i may die this minute if i did
it was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement i reckon i never used a weepon in my life before joe_harper
i ve fought but never with weepons they ll all say that joe_harper dont tell say you wont tell joe_harper that a good feller
i always liked you joe_harper and stood up for you too dont you remember you wont tell will you joe_harper and the poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolid murderer and clasped his appealing hands
no you ve always been fair and square with me muff_potter and i wont go back on you there now that as fair as a man can say
oh joe_harper you re an angel i ll bless you for this the longest day i live and muff_potter began to cry
come now that enough of that this aint any time for blubbering you be off yonder way and i ll go this
move now and dont leave any tracks behind you muff_potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run
he muttered if he as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he had the look of being he wont think of the knife till he gone so far he ll be afraid to come back after it to such a place by himself chicken heart
two or three minute later the murdered man the blanketed corpse the lidless coffin and the open grave were under no inspection but the moon
the half breed stood looking after him the stillness was complete again too chapter the two boy flew on and on toward the village speechless with horror
every stump that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy and made them catch their breath and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay near the village the barking of the aroused watch dog seemed to give wings to their feet
they glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time apprehensively as if they feared they might be followed if we can only get to the old tannery before we break down whispered tom_sawyer in short catches between breaths
huckleberry_finn hard pantings were his only reply and the boy fixed their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it
they gained steadily on it and at last breast to breast they burst through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering shadows beyond
i cant stand it much longer by and by their pulses slowed down and tom_sawyer whispered huckleberry_finn what do you reckon ll come of this
if doctor robinson dies i reckon hanging ll come of it do you though why i know it tom_sawyer
tom_sawyer thought a while then he said who ll tell we what are you talking about pose something happened and injun joe_harper didnt hang
why he kill us some time or other just as dead sure as we re a laying here that just what i was thinking to myself huck_finn
if anybody tells let muff_potter do it if he fool enough he generally drunk enough tom_sawyer said nothing went on thinking
presently he whispered huck_finn muff_potter dont know it how can he tell what the reason he dont know it
because he just got that whack when injun joe_harper done it you reckon he could see anything you reckon he knowed anything
by hokey that so tom_sawyer and besides look a here maybe that whack done for him no taint likely tom_sawyer
well when pap full you might take and belt him over the head with a church and you couldnt phase him
he had liquor in him i could see that and besides he always has he says so his own self so it the same with muff_potter of course
but if a man was dead sober i reckon maybe that whack might fetch him i dono after another reflective silence tom_sawyer said hucky you sure you can keep mum
that injun devil wouldnt make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats if we was to squeak bout this and they didnt hang him
tom_sawyer we got to keep mum you know that now look a here tom_sawyer less take and swear to one another that what we got to do swear to keep mum
i agreed it the best thing would you just hold hands and swear that we oh no that wouldnt do for this
cuz they go back on you anyway and blab if they get in a huff but there orter be writing bout a big thing like this
that good enough for little rubbishy common thing specially with gals and blood tom_sawyer whole being applauded this idea it was deep and dark and awful the hour the circumstances the surroundings were in keeping with it
he picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon light took a little fragment of red keel out of his pocket got the moon on his work and painfully scrawled these lines emphasizing each slow down stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth and letting up the pressure on the up strokes
huck_finn and tom_sawyer swears they will keep mum about this and they wish they may drop down dead in their tracks if they ever tell and rot
see next page huckleberry_finn was filled with admiration of tom_sawyer facility in writing and the sublimity of his language
he at once took a pin from his lapel and was going to prick his flesh but tom_sawyer said hold on
dont do that a pin brass it might have verdigrease on it what verdigrease it p ison that what it is
so tom_sawyer unwound the thread from one of his needles and each boy pricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood
in time after many squeezes tom_sawyer managed to sign his initials using the ball of his little finger for a pen
you just swaller some of it once you ll see then he showed huckleberry_finn how to make an and an and the oath was complete
they buried the shingle close to the wall with some dismal ceremonies and incantations and the fetters that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown away
a figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined building now but they did not notice it
tom_sawyer whispered huckleberry_finn does this keep us from ever telling always of course it does it dont make any difference what happens we got to keep mum
we drop down dead dont you know that yes i reckon that so they continued to whisper for some little time
presently a dog set up a long lugubrious howl just outside within ten feet of them the boy clasped each other suddenly in an agony of fright
which of us does he mean gasped huckleberry_finn i dono peep through the crack quick no you tom_sawyer
i cant i cant do it huck_finn please tom_sawyer there tis again oh lordy i thankful whispered tom_sawyer
if mr harbison owned a slave named bull tom_sawyer would have spoken of him as harbison bull but a son or a dog of that name was bull harbison
i know his voice it bull harbison oh that good i tell you tom_sawyer i was most scared to death i a bet anything it was a stray dog
the dog howled again the boy heart sank once more oh my that aint no bull harbison whispered huckleberry_finn
do tom_sawyer tom quaking with fear yielded and put his eye to the crack his whisper was hardly audible when he said oh huck_finn its a stray dog
quick tom_sawyer quick who does he mean huck_finn he must mean us both we re right together oh tom_sawyer i reckon we re goners
i reckon there aint no mistake bout where i ll go to i been so wicked dad fetch it this comes of playing hookey and doing everything a feller told not to do
i might a been good like sid if i a tried but no i wouldnt of course but if ever i get off this time i lay
i ll just waller in sunday schools and tom_sawyer began to snuffle a little you bad and huckleberry_finn began to snuffle too
consound it tom_sawyer you re just old pie long side what i am oh lordy lordy lordy i wisht i only had half your chance
tom_sawyer choked off and whispered look hucky look he got his back to us hucky looked with joy in his heart
well he has by jingoes did he before yes he did but i like a fool never thought oh this is bully you know
now who can he mean the howling stopped tom_sawyer pricked up his ears sh what that he whispered
sounds like like hogs grunting no it somebody snoring tom_sawyer that is it where bouts is it huck_finn i bleeve it down at tother end
pap used to sleep there sometimes long with the hogs but laws bless you he just lifts thing when he snores
sounds so anyway besides i reckon he aint ever coming back to this town any more the spirit of adventure rose in the boy soul once more
hucky do you dast to go if i lead i dont like to much tom_sawyer pose it injun joe_harper tom_sawyer quailed
but presently the temptation rose up strong again and the boy agreed to try with the understanding that they would take to their heels if the snoring stopped
when they had got to within five steps of the snorer tom_sawyer stepped on a stick and it broke with a sharp snap
so they went tiptoeing stealthily down the one behind the other the man moaned writhed a little and his face came into the moonlight
it was muff_potter the boy heart had stood still and their hopes too when the man moved but their fears passed away now
they tip toed out through the broken weather boarding and stopped at a little distance to exchange a parting word that long lugubrious howl rose on the night air again
they turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few feet of where muff_potter was lying and facing muff_potter with his nose pointing heavenward
say tom_sawyer they say a stray dog come howling around johnny miller house bout midnight as much as two weeks ago and a whippoorwill come in and lit on the banisters and sung the very same evening and there aint anybody dead there yet
oh geeminy it him exclaimed both boy in a breath well i know that and suppose there aint
didnt gracie miller fall in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next saturday yes but she aint dead
and what more she getting better too all right you wait and see she a goner just as dead sure as muff_potter a goner
that what the niggers say and they know all about these kind of thing huck_finn then they separated cogitating when tom_sawyer crept in at his bedroom window the night was almost spent
he undressed with excessive caution and fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade he was not aware that the gently snoring sid was awake and had been so for an hour
when tom_sawyer awoke sid was dressed and gone there was a late look in the light a late sense in the atmosphere
he was startled why had he not been called persecuted till he was up as usual the thought filled him with bodings
within five minute he was dressed and down stairs feeling sore and drowsy the family were still at table but they had finished breakfast
there was no voice of rebuke but there were averted eyes there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill to the culprit heart
it roused no smile no response and he lapsed into silence and let his heart sink down to the depths
after breakfast his aunt took him aside and tom_sawyer almost brightened in the hope that he was going to be flogged but it was not so
his aunt wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so and finally told him to go on and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs with sorrow to the grave for it was no use for her to try any more
he sat down and tried to seem gay but it was up hill work this was worse than a thousand whippings and tom_sawyer heart was sorer now than his body
he cried he pleaded for forgiveness promised to reform over and over again and then received his dismissal feeling that he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble confidence
he left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward sid and so the latter prompt retreat through the back gate was unnecessary
he moped to school gloomy and sad and took his flogging along with joe_harper for playing hookey the day before with the air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to trifles
then he betook himself to his seat rested his elbows on his desk and his jaws in his hands and stared at the wall with the stony stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go
his elbow was pressing against some hard substance after a long time he slowly and sadly changed his position and took up this object with a sigh
it was in a paper he unrolled it a long lingering colossal sigh followed and his heart broke it was his brass andiron knob
this final feather broke the camel back chapter xi close upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified with the ghastly news
no need of the as yet un dreamed of telegraph the tale flew from man to man from group to group from house to house with little less than telegraphic speed
of course the schoolmaster gave holi day for that afternoon the town would have thought strangely of him if he had not
a gory knife had been found close to the murdered man and it had been recognized by somebody as belonging to muff_potter so the story ran
and it was said that a belated citizen had come upon muff_potter washing himself in the branch about one or two clock in the morning and that muff_potter had at once sneaked off suspicious circumstances especially the washing which was not a habit with muff_potter
it was also said that the town had been ransacked for this murderer the public are not slow in the matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict but that he could not be found
horsemen had departed down all the roads in every direction and the sheriff was confident that he would be captured before night
all the town was drifting toward the graveyard tom_sawyer heartbreak vanished and he joined the procession not because he would not a thousand time
rather go anywhere else but because an awful unaccountable fascination drew him on arrived at the dreadful place he wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle
it seemed to him an age since he was there before somebody pinched his arm he turned and his eyes met huckleberry_finn
then both looked elsewhere at once and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their mutual glance but everybody was talking and intent upon the grisly spectacle before them
poor fellow poor young fellow this ought to be a lesson to grave robbers muff_potter ll hang for this if they catch him
this was the drift of remark and the minister said it was a judgment his hand is here now tom_sawyer shivered from head to heel for his eye fell upon the stolid face of injun joe_harper
at this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle and voices shouted it him it him he coming himself who
people in the branches of the trees over tom_sawyer head said he wasnt trying to get away he only looked doubtful and perplexed
infernal impudence said a bystander wanted to come and take a quiet look at his work i reckon didnt expect any company
who from twenty voices muff_potter hallo he stopped look out he turning dont let him get away
the crowd fell apart now and the sheriff came through ostentatiously leading muff_potter by the arm the poor fellow face was haggard and his eyes showed the fear that was upon him
when he stood before the murdered man he shook as with a palsy and he put his face in his hands and burst into tears
i didnt do it friends he sobbed pon my word and honor i never done it who accused you shouted a voice
this shot seemed to carry home muff_potter lifted his face and looked around him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes
he saw injun joe_harper and exclaimed oh injun joe_harper you promised me you never is that your knife and it was thrust before him by the sheriff
muff_potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the ground then he said something told met if i didnt come back and get
he shuddered then waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said tell em joe_harper tell em it aint any use any more
then huckleberry_finn and tom_sawyer stood dumb and staring and heard the stony hearted liar reel off his serene statement they expecting every moment that the clear sky would deliver god lightnings upon his head and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed
and when he had finished and still stood alive and whole their wavering impulse to break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner life faded and vanished away for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to satan and it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that
why didnt you leave what did you want to come here for somebody said i couldnt help it
i couldnt help it muff_potter moaned i wanted to run away but i couldnt seem to come anywhere but here
injun joe_harper repeated his statement just as calmly a few minute afterward on the inquest under oath and the boy seeing that the lightnings were still withheld were confirmed in their belief that joe_harper had sold himself to the devil
he was now become to them the most balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon and they could not take their fascinated eyes from his face
they inwardly resolved to watch him nights when opportunity should offer in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master
injun joe_harper helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in a wagon for removal and it was whispered through the shuddering crowd that the wound bled a little
the boy thought that this happy circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction but they were disappointed for more than one villager remarked it was within three feet of muff_potter when it done it
tom_sawyer fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as much as a week after this and at breakfast one morning
sid said tom_sawyer you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me awake half the time
and he fell to sobbing again tom_sawyer blanched and dropped his eyes it a bad sign said aunt_polly gravely
what you got on your mind tom_sawyer nothing nothingt i know of but the boy hand shook so that he spilled his coffee
and you do talk such stuff sid said last night you said it blood it blood that what it is
you said that over and over and you said dont torment me so i ll tell tell what what is it you ll tell
there is no telling what might have happened now but luckily the concern passed out of aunt_polly face and she came to tom_sawyer relief without knowing it
everything was swimming before tom_sawyer she said sho it that dreadful murder i dream about it most every night myself
sometimes i dream it me that done it mary said she had been affected much the same way sid seemed satisfied
tom_sawyer got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could and after that he complained of toothache for a week and tied up his jaws every night
he never knew that sid lay nightly watching and frequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good while at a time and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place again
tom_sawyer distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew irksome and was discarded if sid really managed to make anything out of tom_sawyer disjointed mutterings he kept it to himself
it seemed to tom_sawyer that his schoolmates never would get done holding inquests on dead cats and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind
sid noticed that tom_sawyer never was coroner at one of these inquiries though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises he noticed too that tom_sawyer never acted as a witness and that was strange and sid did not overlook the fact that tom_sawyer even showed a marked aversion to these inquests and always avoided them when he could
every day or two during this time of sorrow tom_sawyer watched his opportunity and went to the little grated jail window and smuggled such small comforts through to the murderer as he could get hold of
the jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge of the village and no guards were afforded for it indeed it was seldom occupied
sid marvelled but said nothing however even inquests went out of vogue at last and ceased to torture tom_sawyer conscience these offerings greatly helped to ease tom_sawyer conscience
the villagers had a strong desire to tar and feather injun joe_harper and ride him on a rail for body snatching but so formidable was his character that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the matter so it was dropped
he had been careful to begin both of his inquest statements with the fight without confessing the grave robbery that preceded it therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in the courts at present
chapter xii one of the reasons why tom_sawyer mind had drifted away from its secret troubles was that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest itself about
becky_thatcher had stopped coming to school tom_sawyer had struggled with his pride a few days and tried to whistle her down the wind but failed
he began to find himself hanging around her father house nights and feeling very miserable she was ill what if she should die
there was distraction in the thought he no longer took an interest in war nor even in piracy the charm of life was gone there was nothing but dreariness left
he put his hoop away and his bat there was no joy in them any more his aunt was concerned she began to try all manner of remedies on him
she was one of those people who are infatuated with patent medicines and all new fangled methods of producing health or mending it
when something fresh in this line came out she was in a fever right away to try it not on herself for she was never ailing but on anybody else that came handy
she was a subscriber for all the health periodicals and phrenological frauds and the solemn ignorance they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils
all the rot they contained about ventilation and how to go to bed and how to get up and what to eat and what to drink and how much exercise to take and what frame of mind to keep one self in and what sort of clothing to wear was all gospel to her and she never observed that her health journals of the current month customarily upset everything they had recommended the month before
she was an inveterate experimenter in these thing she was as simple hearted and honest as the day was long and so she was an easy victim
she gathered together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines and thus armed with death went about on her pale horse metaphorically speaking with hell following after
but she never suspected that she was not an angel of healing and the balm of gilead in disguise to the suffering neighbors
she had him out at daylight every morning stood him up in the wood shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water then she scrubbed him down with a towel like a file and so brought him to then she rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she sweated his soul clean and
the water treatment was new now and tom_sawyer low condition was a windfall to her the yellow stains of it came through his pores as tom_sawyer said
yet notwithstanding all this the boy grew more and more melancholy and pale and dejected she added hot baths sitz baths shower baths and plunges
the boy remained as dismal as a hearse she began to assist the water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister plasters
she calculated his capacity as she would a jug and filled him up every day with quack cure alls tom_sawyer had become indifferent to persecution by this time
this phase filled the old lady heart with consternation this indifference must be broken up at any cost now she heard of pain killer for the first time
she ordered a lot at once she tasted it and was filled with gratitude it was simply fire in a liquid form
she dropped the water treatment and everything else and pinned her faith to pain killer she gave tom_sawyer a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the result
her troubles were instantly at rest her soul at peace again for the indifference was broken up the boy could not have shown a wilder heartier interest if she had built a fire under him
tom_sawyer felt that it was time to wake up this sort of life might be romantic enough in his blighted condition but it was getting to have too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it
he asked for it so often that he became a nuisance and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and quit bothering her
if it had been sid she would have had no misgivings to alloy her delight but since it was tom_sawyer she watched the bottle clandestinely
she found that the medicine did really diminish but it did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in the sitting room floor with it
one day tom_sawyer was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunt yellow cat came along purring eyeing the teaspoon avariciously and begging for a taste
so he thought over various plans for relief and finally hit upon that of professing to be fond of pain killer tom_sawyer said dont ask for it unless you want it peter
now you ve asked for it and i ll give it to you because there aint anything mean about me but if you find you dont like it you mustnt blame anybody but your own self
but peter signified that he did want it you better make sure peter was sure peter was agreeable
peter sprang a couple of yards in the air and then delivered a war whoop and set off round and round the room banging against furniture upsetting flower pots and making general havoc
next he rose on his hind feet and pranced around in a frenzy of enjoyment with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness
so tom_sawyer pried his mouth open and poured down the pain killer then he went tearing around the house again spreading chaos and destruction in his path
aunt_polly entered in time to see him throw a few double summersets deliver a final mighty hurrah and sail through the open window carrying the rest of the flower pots with him
the old lady stood petrified with astonishment peering over her glasses tom_sawyer lay on the floor expiring with laughter tom_sawyer what on earth ails that cat
i dont know aunt gasped the boy why i never see anything like it what did make him act so
deed i dont know aunt_polly cats always act so when they re having a good time they do do they
there was something in the tone that made tom_sawyer apprehensive yes that is i believe they do you do
yes the old lady was bending down tom_sawyer watching with interest emphasized by anxiety too late he divined her drift
the handle of the telltale tea spoon was visible under the bed valance aunt_polly took it held it up tom_sawyer winced and dropped his eyes
aunt_polly raised him by the usual handle his ear and cracked his head soundly with her thimble now sir what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so for
i done it out of pity for him because he hadnt any aunt hadnt any aunt you numskull what has that got to do with it
heaps because if he had one she a burnt him out herself she a roasted his bowels out of him thout any more feeling than if he was a human
this was putting the thing in a new light what was cruelty to a cat might be cruelty to a boy too
her eyes watered a little and she put her hand on tom_sawyer head and said gently i was meaning for the best tom_sawyer
aunt_polly felt a sudden pang of remorse she began to soften she felt sorry and tom_sawyer it did do you good
tom_sawyer looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping through his gravity i know you was meaning for the best aunty and
so was i with peter it done him good too i never see him get around so since oh go long with you
and you try and see if you cant be a good boy for once and you neednt take any more medicine
tom_sawyer before you aggravate me again tom_sawyer reached school ahead of time it was noticed that this strange thing had been occurring every day latterly
and now as usual of late he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his comrades he was sick he said and he looked it
he tried to seem to be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking down the road presently jeff_thatcher becky_thatcher hove in sight and tom_sawyer face lighted he gazed a moment and then turned sorrowfully away
when jeff_thatcher arrived tom_sawyer accosted him and led up warily to opportunities for remark about becky_thatcher but the giddy lad never could see the bait
tom_sawyer watched and watched hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight and hating the owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one
at last frocks ceased to appear and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps he entered the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer
the next instant he was out and going on like an indian yelling laughing chasing boy jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb throwing handsprings standing on his head doing all the heroic thing he could conceive of and keeping a furtive eye out all the while to see if becky_thatcher was noticing
then one more frock passed in at the gate and tom_sawyer heart gave a great bound but she seemed to be unconscious of it all she never looked
he carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity came war whooping around snatched a boy cap hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse broke through a group of boy tumbling them in every direction and fell sprawling himself under becky_thatcher nose almost upsetting her and she turned with her nose in the air and he heard her say
could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there mf some people think they re mighty smart always showing off
tom_sawyer cheeks burned he gathered himself up and sneaked off crushed and crestfallen chapter xiii tom_sawyer mind was made up now
he said nobody loved him when they found out what they had driven him to perhaps they would be sorry he had tried to do right and get along but they would not let him since nothing would do them but to be rid of him let it be so and let them blame him for the consequences why shouldnt they
he was gloomy and desperate he was a forsaken friendless boy what right had the friendless to complain yes they had forced him to it at last he would lead a life of crime
by this time he was far down meadow lane and the bell for school to take up tinkled faintly upon his ear
he sobbed now to think he should never never hear that old familiar sound any more it was very hard but it was forced on him since he was driven out into the cold world he must submit but he forgave them
just at this point he met his soul sworn comrade joe_harper hard eyed and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his heart
there was no choice then the sobs came thick and fast plainly here were two soul with but a single thought
tom_sawyer wiping his eyes with his sleeve began to blubber out something about a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by roaming abroad into the great world never to return and ended by hoping that joe_harper would not forget him
but it transpired that this was a request which joe_harper had just been going to make of tom_sawyer and had come to hunt him up for that purpose
his mother had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and knew nothing about it was plain that she was tired of him and wished him to go if she felt that way there was nothing for him to do but succumb he hoped she would be happy and never regret having driven her poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die
as the two boy walked sorrowing along they made a new compact to stand by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved them of their troubles
joe_harper was for being a hermit and living on crusts in a remote cave and dying some time of cold and want and grief but after listening to tom_sawyer he conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of crime and so he consented to be a pirate
three miles below st petersburg at a point where the mississippi river was a trifle over a mile wide there was a long narrow wooded island with a shallow bar at the head of it and this offered well as a rendezvous
then they began to lay their plans it was not inhabited it lay far over toward the further shore abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest
so jackson island was chosen who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a matter that did not occur to them
then they hunted up huckleberry_finn and he joined them promptly for all careers were one to him he was indifferent
they presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the river bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour which was midnight
each would bring hooks and lines and such provision as he could steal in the most dark and mysterious way as became outlaws
and before the afternoon was done they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would hear something
there was a small log raft there which they meant to capture all who got this vague hint were cautioned to be mum and wait
about midnight tom_sawyer arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the meeting place
it was starlight and very still the mighty river lay like an ocean at rest tom_sawyer listened a moment but no sound disturbed the quiet
then he gave a low distinct whistle it was answered from under the bluff tom_sawyer whistled twice more these signals were answered in the same way
then a guarded voice said who goes there tom_sawyer the black avenger of the spanish main name your names
huck_finn the red handed and joe_harper the terror of the seas tom_sawyer had furnished these titles from his favorite literature
tis well give the countersign two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the brooding night blood
then tom_sawyer tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort
there was an easy comfortable path along the shore under the bluff but it lacked the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate
the terror of the seas had brought a side of bacon and had about worn himself out with getting it there
finn the red handed had stolen a skillet and a quantity of half cured leaf tobacco and had also brought a few corn cobs to make pipes with
but none of the pirates smoked or chewed but himself the black avenger of the spanish main said it would never do to start without some fire
they saw a fire smouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards above and they went stealthily thither and helped themselves to a chunk
that was a wise thought matches were hardly known there in that day they made an imposing adventure of it saying hist
every now and then and suddenly halting with finger on lip moving with hands on imaginary dagger hilts and giving orders in dismal whispers that if the foe stirred to let him have it to the hilt because dead men tell no tales
they knew well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying in stores or having a spree but still that was no excuse for their conducting this thing in an unpiratical way
tom_sawyer stood amidships gloomy browed and with folded arms and gave his orders in a low stern whisper luff and bring her to the wind
they shoved off presently tom_sawyer in command huck_finn at the after oar and joe_harper at the forward aye aye sir
as the boy steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid stream it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for style and were not intended to mean anything in particular
steady steady y steady it is sir let her go off a point point it is sir what sail she carrying
courses tops ls and flying jib sir send the yals up lay out aloft there half a dozen of ye foretopmaststuns lively now aye aye sir
shake out that maintogalans sheets and braces now my hearties aye aye sir hellum a lee hard a port stand by to meet her when she comes
the raft drew beyond the middle of the river the boy pointed her head right and then lay on their oars
port port now men with a will stead y steady it is sir the river was not high so there was not more than a two or three mile current
hardly a word was said during the next three quarters of an hour now the raft was passing before the distant town
two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay peacefully sleeping beyond the vague vast sweep of star gemmed water unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening
the black avenger stood still with folded arms looking his last upon the scene of his former joys and his later sufferings and wishing she could see him now abroad on the wild sea facing peril and death with dauntless heart going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips
it was but a small strain on his imagination to remove jackson island beyond eye shot of the village and so he looked his last with a broken and satisfied heart
the other pirates were looking their last too and they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift them out of the range of the island
about two clock in the morning the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight
part of the little raft belongings consisted of an old sail and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather as became outlaws
they built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps within the sombre depths of the forest and then cooked some bacon in the frying pan for supper and used up half of the corn pone stock they had brought
it seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island far from the haunts of men and they said they never would return to civilization
the climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy glare upon the pillared tree trunks of their forest temple and upon the varnished foliage and festooning vines
when the last crisp slice of bacon was gone and the last allowance of corn pone devoured the boy stretched themselves out on the grass filled with contentment
they could have found a cooler place but they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting campfire
but they discovered the danger in time and made shift to avert it aint it gay said joe_harper it nuts said tom_sawyer
what would the boy say if they could see us say well they just die to be here hey hucky
i dont ever get enough to eat gen ally and here they cant come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so
i reckon so said huckleberry_finn anyways i suited i dont want nothing better this it just the life for me said tom_sawyer
you dont have to get up mornings and you dont have to go to school and wash and all that blame foolishness
you see a pirate dont have to do anything joe_harper when he ashore but a hermit he has to be praying considerable
and then he dont have any fun anyway all by himself that way oh yes that so said joe_harper but i hadnt thought much about it you know
you see said tom_sawyer people dont go much on hermits nowadays like they used to in old time but a pirate always respected
and a hermit got to sleep on the hardest place he can find and put sackcloth and ashes on his head and stand out in the rain and
i a good deal rather be a pirate now that i ve tried it what does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for
inquired huck_finn i dono but they ve got to do it hermits always do you have to do that if you was a hermit
dern if i would said huck_finn well what would you do i dono but i wouldnt do that why huck_finn you have to
how you get around it why i just wouldnt stand it i run away run away well you would be a nice old slouch of a hermit
he had finished gouging out a cob and now he fitted a weed stem to it loaded it with tobacco and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of fragrant smoke he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment
you be a disgrace the red handed made no response being better employed the other pirates envied him this majestic vice and secretly resolved to acquire it shortly
tom_sawyer said oh they have just a bully time take ships and burn them and get the money and bury it in awful places in their island where there ghosts and thing to watch it and kill everybody in the ships make em walk a plank
presently huck_finn said what does pirates have to do and they carry the women to the island said joe_harper they dont kill the women
no assented tom_sawyer they dont kill the women they re too noble and the women always beautiful too and dont they wear the bulliest clothes
oh no all gold and silver and di monds said joe_harper with enthusiasm who said huck_finn why the pirates
huck_finn scanned his own clothing forlornly i reckon i aint dressed fitten for a pirate said he with a regretful pathos in his voice
but i aint got none but these but the other boy told him the fine clothes would come fast enough after they should have begun their adventures
they made him understand that his poor rags would do to begin with though it was customary for wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe
gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the eyelids of the little waifs the pipe dropped from the fingers of the red handed and he slept the sleep of the conscience free and the weary
they said their prayers inwardly and lying down since there was nobody there with authority to make them kneel and recite aloud in truth they had a mind not to say them at all but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven
then at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep but an intruder came now that would not down
the terror of the seas and the black avenger of the spanish main had more difficulty in getting to sleep
they began to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away and next they thought of the stolen meat and then the real torture came
they tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of time but conscience was not to be appeased by such thin plausibilities it seemed to them in the end that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was only hooking while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plain simple stealing and there was a command against that in the bible
so they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the business their piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing
it was conscience then conscience granted a truce and these curiously inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep chapter xiv when tom_sawyer awoke in the morning
it was the cool gray dawn and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the deep pervading calm and silence of the woods
he wondered where he was he sat up and rubbed his eyes and looked around then he comprehended not a leaf stirred not a sound obtruded upon great nature meditation
beaded dewdrops stood upon the leaves and grasses a white layer of ashes covered the fire and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air
joe_harper and huck_finn still slept now far away in the woods a bird called another answered presently the hammering of a woodpecker was heard
gradually the cool dim gray of the morning whitened and as gradually sounds multiplied and life manifested itself the marvel of nature shaking off sleep and going to work unfolded itself to the musing boy
a little green worm came crawling over a dewy leaf lifting two thirds of his body into the air from time to time and sniffing around then proceeding again for he was measuring tom_sawyer said and when the worm approached him of its own accord he sat as still as a stone with his hopes rising and falling by turns as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to go elsewhere and when at last it considered a painful moment with its curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon tom_sawyer leg and began a journey over him his whole heart was glad for that meant that he was going to have a new suit of clothes without the shadow of a doubt a gaudy piratical uniform
now a procession of ants appeared from nowhere in particular and went about their labors one struggled manfully by with a dead spider five time as big as itself in its arms and lugged it straight up a tree trunk
a brown spotted lady bug climbed the dizzy height of a grass blade and tom_sawyer bent down close to it and said lady bug lady bug fly away home your house is on fire your children alone and she took wing and went off to see about it which did not surprise the boy for he knew of old that this insect was credulous about conflagrations and he had practised upon its simplicity more than once
a tumblebug came next heaving sturdily at its ball and tom_sawyer touched the creature to see it shut its legs against its body and pretend to be dead
a catbird the northern mocker lit in a tree over tom_sawyer head and trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment then a shrill jay swept down a flash of blue flame and stopped on a twig almost within the boy reach cocked his head to one side and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity a gray squirrel and a big fellow of the fox kind came skurrying along sitting up at intervals to inspect and chatter at the boy for the wild thing had probably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not
all nature was wide awake and stirring now long lances of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and near and a few butterflies came fluttering upon the scene
tom_sawyer stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with a shout and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white sandbar
the birds were fairly rioting by this time they felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the distance beyond the majestic waste of water
a vagrant current or a slight rise in the river had carried off their raft but this only gratified them since its going was something like burning the bridge between them and civilization
huck_finn found a spring of clear cold water close by and the boy made cups of broad oak or hickory leaves and felt that water sweetened with such a wildwood charm as that would be a good enough substitute for coffee
while joe_harper was slicing bacon for breakfast tom_sawyer and huck_finn asked him to hold on a minute they stepped to a promising nook in the river bank and threw in their lines almost immediately they had reward
joe_harper had not had time to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass a couple of sun perch and a small catfish provisions enough for quite a family
they came back to camp wonderfully refreshed glad hearted and ravenous and they soon had the camp fire blazing up again they fried the fish with the bacon and were astonished for no fish had ever seemed so delicious before
they did not know that the quicker a fresh water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better he is and they reflected little upon what a sauce open air sleeping open air exercise bathing and a large ingredient of hunger make too
they lay around in the shade after breakfast while huck_finn had a smoke and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition
they tramped gayly along over decaying logs through tangled underbrush among solemn monarchs of the forest hung from their crowns to the ground with a drooping regalia of grape vines
now and then they came upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers they found plenty of thing to be delighted with but nothing to be astonished at
they discovered that the island was about three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide and that the shore it lay closest to was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards wide
they took a swim about every hour so it was close upon the middle of the afternoon when they got back to camp
they were too hungry to stop to fish but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham and then threw themselves down in the shade to talk
the stillness the solemnity that brooded in the woods and the sense of loneliness began to tell upon the spirits of the boy
but the talk soon began to drag and then died they fell to thinking a sort of undefined longing crept upon them
this took dim shape presently it was budding homesickness even finn the red handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads but they were all ashamed of their weakness and none was brave enough to speak his thought
for some time now the boy had been dully conscious of a peculiar sound in the distance just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a clock which he takes no distinct note of
but now this mysterious sound became more pronounced and forced a recognition the boy started glanced at each other and then each assumed a listening attitude
there was a long silence profound and unbroken then a deep sullen boom came floating down out of the distance
what is it exclaimed joe_harper under his breath i wonder said tom_sawyer in a whisper taint thunder said huckleberry_finn in an awed tone becuz thunder
hark said tom_sawyer listen dont talk they waited a time that seemed an age and then the same muffled boom troubled the solemn hush
let go and see they sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town they parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water
the little steam ferry boat was about a mile below the village drifting with the current her broad deck seemed crowded with people
there were a great many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood of the ferryboat but the boy could not determine what the men in them were doing
presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the ferryboat side and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud that same dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again
that it said huck_finn they done that last summer when bill turner got drownded they shoot a cannon over the water and that makes him come up to the top
yes and they take loaves of bread and put quicksilver in em and set em afloat and wherever there anybody that drownded they ll float right there and stop
i know now exclaimed tom_sawyer somebody drownded yes i ve heard about that said joe_harper i wonder what makes the bread do that
oh it aint the bread so much said tom_sawyer i reckon it mostly what they say over it before they start it out
but they dont say anything over it said huck_finn i ve seen em and they dont well that funny said tom_sawyer
the other boy agreed that there was reason in what tom_sawyer said because an ignorant lump of bread uninstructed by an incantation could not be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such gravity
but maybe they say it to themselves of course they do anybody might know that by jings i wish i was over there now said joe_harper
i do too said huck_finn i give heaps to know who it is the boy still listened and watched
presently a revealing thought flashed through tom_sawyer mind and he exclaimed boy i know who drownded it us they felt like hero in an instant
here was a gorgeous triumph they were missed they were mourned heart were breaking on their account tears were being shed accusing memory of unkindness to these poor lost lads were rising up and unavailing regrets and remorse were being indulged and best of all the departed were the talk of the whole town and the envy of all the boy as far as this dazzling notoriety was concerned
this was fine it was worth while to be a pirate after all as twilight drew on the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business and the skiffs disappeared
the pirates returned to camp they were jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble they were making
they caught fish cooked supper and ate it and then fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were gratifying to look upon from their point of view
but when the shadows of night closed them in they gradually ceased to talk and sat gazing into the fire with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere
the excitement was gone now and tom_sawyer and joe_harper could not keep back thoughts of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as much as they were
by and by joe_harper timidly ventured upon a roundabout feeler as to how the others might look upon a return to civilization not right now but
huck_finn being uncommitted as yet joined in with tom_sawyer and the waverer quickly explained and was glad to get out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken hearted home sickness clinging to his garments as he could
misgivings came they grew troubled and unhappy a sigh or two escaped unawares tom_sawyer withered him with derision mutiny was effectually laid to rest for the moment
as the night deepened huck_finn began to nod and presently to snore joe_harper followed next tom_sawyer lay upon his elbow motionless for some time watching the two intently
at last he got up cautiously on his knees and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung by the campfire
he picked up and inspected several large semi cylinders of the thin white bark of a sycamore and finally chose two which seemed to suit him
then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something upon each of these with his red keel one he rolled up and put in his jacket pocket and the other he put in joe_harper hat and removed it to a little distance from the owner
and he also put into the hat certain schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value among them a lump of chalk an india rubber ball three fishhooks and one of that kind of marbles known as a sure nough crystal
then he tiptoed his way cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing and straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar
chapter xv a few minute later tom_sawyer was in the shoal water of the bar wading toward the illinois shore
he was halfway over the current would permit no more wading now so he struck out confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards
before the depth reached his middle he swam quartering upstream but still was swept downward rather faster than he had expected
he put his hand on his jacket pocket found his piece of bark safe and then struck through the woods following the shore with streaming garments
shortly before ten clock he came out into an open place opposite the village and saw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank
however he reached the shore finally and drifted along till he found a low place and drew himself out everything was quiet under the blinking stars
he crept down the bank watching with all his eyes slipped into the water swam three or four strokes and climbed into the skiff that did yawl duty at the boat stern
he laid himself down under the thwarts and waited panting presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to cast off
a minute or two later the skiff head was standing high up against the boat swell and the voyage was begun
at the end of a long twelve or fifteen minute the wheels stopped and tom_sawyer slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk landing fifty yards downstream out of danger of possible stragglers
tom_sawyer felt happy in his success for he knew it was the boat last trip for the night he flew along unfrequented alleys and shortly found himself at his aunt back fence
he climbed over approached the ell and looked in at the sitting room window for a light was burning there there sat aunt_polly sid mary and joe_harper mother grouped together talking
tom_sawyer went to the door and began to softly lift the latch then he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack he continued pushing cautiously and quaking every time it creaked till he judged he might squeeze through on his knees so he put his head through and began warily
they were by the bed and the bed was between them and the door what makes the candle blow so said aunt_polly
tom_sawyer hurried up why that door open i believe why of course it is no end of strange thing now
go long and shut it sid tom_sawyer disappeared under the bed just in time he lay and breathed himself for a time and then crept to where he could almost touch his aunt foot
but as i was saying said aunt_polly he warnt bad so to say only misch ee vous only just giddy and harum scarum you know
he warnt any more responsible than a colt he never meant any harm and he was the best hearted boy that ever was and
it was just so with my joe_harper always full of his devilment and up to every kind of mischief but he was just as unselfish and kind as he could be and laws bless me to think i went and whipped him for taking that cream never once recollecting that i throwed it out myself because it was sour and i never to see him again in this world never never never poor abused boy
she began to cry and mrs joe_harper sobbed as if her heart would break i hope tom_sawyer better off where he is said sid but if he been better in some way
sid tom_sawyer felt the glare of the old lady eye though he could not see it not a word against my tom_sawyer now that he gone
god ll take care of him never you trouble your self sir oh mrs joe_harper i dont know how to give him up
i dont know how to give him up he was such a comfort to me although he tormented my old heart out of me most
the lord giveth and the lord hath taken away blessed be the name of the lord but it so hard
oh it so hard only last saturday my joe_harper busted a firecracker right under my nose and i knocked him sprawling
little did i know then how soon oh if it was to do over again i hug him and bless him for it
no longer ago than yesterday noon my tom_sawyer took and filled the cat full of pain killer and i did think the cretur would tear the house down
yes yes yes i know just how you feel mrs joe_harper i know just exactly how you feel and god forgive me i cracked tom_sawyer head with my thimble poor boy poor dead boy
but he out of all his troubles now and the last words i ever heard him say was to reproach but this memory was too much for the old lady and she broke entirely down
tom_sawyer was snuffling now himself and more in pity of himself than anybody else he could hear mary crying and putting in a kindly word for him from time to time
still he was sufficiently touched by his aunt grief to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy and the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his nature too but he resisted and lay still
he went on listening and gathered by odds and ends that it was conjectured at first that the boy had got drowned while taking a swim then the small raft had been missed next certain boy said the missing lads had promised that the village should hear something soon the wise heads had put this and that together and decided that the lads had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below presently but toward noon the raft had been found lodged against the missouri shore some five or six miles below the village and then hope perished they must be drowned else hunger would have driven them home by nightfall if not sooner
it was believed that the search for the bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must have occurred in mid channel since the boy being good swimmers would otherwise have escaped to shore
if the bodies continued missing until sunday all hope would be given over and the funerals would be preached on that morning
he began to have a nobler opinion of himself than ever before this was wednesday night tom_sawyer shuddered mrs joe_harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go
then with a mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other arms and had a good consoling cry and then parted
aunt_polly was tender far beyond her wont in her goodnight to sid and mary sid snuffled a bit and mary went off crying with all her heart
aunt_polly knelt down and prayed for tom_sawyer so touchingly so appealingly and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice that he was weltering in tears again long before she was through
he had to keep still long after she went to bed for she kept making broken hearted ejaculations from time to time tossing unrestfully and turning over
but at last she was still only moaning a little in her sleep now the boy stole out rose gradually by the bedside shaded the candle light with his hand and stood regarding her
his heart was full of pity for her he took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the candle but something occurred to him and he lingered considering
his face lighted with a happy solution of his thought he put the bark hastily in his pocket then he bent over and kissed the faded lips and straightway made his stealthy exit latching the door behind him
he threaded his way back to the ferry landing found nobody at large there and walked boldly on board the boat for he knew she was tenantless except that there was a watchman who always turned in and slept like a graven image
he untied the skiff at the stern slipped into it and was soon rowing cautiously upstream when he had pulled a mile above the village he started quartering across and bent himself stoutly to his work
he was moved to capture the skiff arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore legitimate prey for a pirate but he knew a thorough search would be made for it and that might end in revelations
he hit the landing on the other side neatly for this was a familiar bit of work to him so he stepped ashore and entered the woods
he sat down and took a long rest torturing himself meanwhile to keep awake and then started warily down the home stretch
he rested again until the sun was well up and gilding the great river with its splendor and then he plunged into the stream
a little later he paused dripping upon the threshold of the camp and heard joe_harper say no tom_sawyer true blue huck_finn and he ll come back
the night was far spent it was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the island bar he wont desert
he knows that would be a disgrace to a pirate and tom_sawyer too proud for that sort of thing he up to something or other
now i wonder what well the thing is ours anyway aint they pretty near but not yet huck_finn the writing says they are if he aint back here to breakfast
a sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided and as the boy set to work upon it tom_sawyer recounted and adorned his adventures
which he is exclaimed tom_sawyer with fine dramatic effect stepping grandly into camp they were a vain and boastful company of hero when the tale was done
then tom_sawyer hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep till noon and the other pirates got ready to fish and explore
they went about poking sticks into the sand and when they found a soft place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands
chapter xvi after dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on the bar sometimes they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole
they were perfectly round white thing a trifle smaller than an english walnut they had a famous fried egg feast that night and another on friday morning
after breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar and chased each other round and round shedding clothes as they went until they were naked and then continued the frolic far away up the shoal water of the bar against the stiff current which latter tripped their legs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun
and now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in each other faces with their palms gradually approaching each other with averted faces to avoid the strangling sprays and finally gripping and struggling till the best man ducked his neighbor and then they all went under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowing sputtering laughing and gasping for breath at one and the same time
when they were well exhausted they would run out and sprawl on the dry hot sand and lie there and cover themselves up with it and by and by break for the water again and go through the original performance once more
finally it occurred to them that their naked skin represented flesh colored tights very fairly so they drew a ring in the sand and had a circus with three clowns in it for none would yield this proudest post to his neighbor
then joe_harper and huck_finn had another swim but tom_sawyer would not venture because he found that in kicking off his trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off his ankle and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without the protection of this mysterious charm
he did not venture again until he had found it and by that time the other boy were tired and ready to rest
they gradually wandered apart dropped into the dumps and fell to gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village lay drowsing in the sun
tom_sawyer found himself writing becky_thatcher in the sand with his big toe he scratched it out and was angry with himself for his weakness
next they got their marbles and played knucks and ringtaw and keeps till that amusement grew stale but he wrote it again nevertheless he could not help it
he erased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by driving the other boy together and joining them
but joe_harper spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection he was so homesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it
the tears lay very near the surface huck_finn was melancholy too tom_sawyer was downhearted but tried hard not to show it
he had a secret which he was not ready to tell yet but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soon he would have to bring it out
he said with a great show of cheerfulness i bet there been pirates on this island before boy we ll explore it again
they ve hid treasures here somewhere how you feel to light on a rotten chest full of gold and silver hey but it roused only faint enthusiasm which faded out with no reply
tom_sawyer tried one or two other seductions but they failed too it was discouraging work joe_harper sat poking up the sand with a stick and looking very gloomy
finally he said oh boy let give it up i want to go home it so lonesome oh no joe_harper you ll feel better by and by said tom_sawyer
just think of the fishing that here i dont care for fishing i want to go home but joe_harper there aint such another swimming place anywhere
swimming no good i dont seem to care for it somehow when there aint anybody to say i sha nt go in
i mean to go home oh shucks baby you want to see your mother i reckon yes i do want to see my mother and you would too if you had one
i aint any more baby than you are and joe_harper snuffled a little well we ll let the crybaby go home to his mother wont we huck_finn
poor thing does it want to see its mother and so it shall you like it here dont you huck_finn we ll stay wont we
huck_finn said e without any heart in it i ll never speak to you again as long as i live said joe_harper rising
there now and he moved moodily away and began to dress himself who cares said tom_sawyer nobody wants you to
go long home and get laughed at oh you re a nice pirate huck_finn and me aint crybabies we ll stay wont we huck_finn
let him go if he wants to i reckon we can get along without him per aps but tom_sawyer was uneasy nevertheless and was alarmed to see joe_harper go sullenly on with his dressing
and then it was discomforting to see huck_finn eying joe_harper preparations so wistfully and keeping up such an ominous silence presently without a parting word joe_harper began to wade off toward the illinois shore
tom_sawyer heart began to sink he glanced at huck_finn huck_finn could not bear the look and dropped his eyes then he said i want to go too tom_sawyer
it was getting so lonesome anyway and now it ll be worse let us go too tom_sawyer i wont you can all go if you want to
i mean to stay tom_sawyer i better go well go long who hendering you huck_finn began to pick up his scattered clothes
he said tom_sawyer i wisht you come too now you think it over we ll wait for you when we get to shore
huck_finn started sorrowfully away and tom_sawyer stood looking after him with a strong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along too
well you ll wait a blame long time that all he hoped the boy would stop but they still waded slowly on
it suddenly dawned on tom_sawyer that it was become very lonely and still he made one final struggle with his pride and then darted after his comrades yelling wait
when he got to where they were he began unfolding his secret and they listened moodily till at last they saw the point he was driving at and then they set up a warwhoop of applause and said it was splendid and said if he had told them at first they wouldnt have started away
he made a plausible excuse but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secret would keep them with him any very great length of time and so he had meant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction
the lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a will chattering all the time about tom_sawyer stupendous plan and admiring the genius of it
wait i want to tell you something they presently stopped and turned around after a dainty egg and fish dinner tom_sawyer said he wanted to learn to smoke now
these novices had never smoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine and they bit the tongue and were not considered manly anyway
joe_harper caught at the idea and said he would like to try too so huck_finn made pipes and filled them now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puff charily and with slender confidence
the smoke had an unpleasant taste and they gagged a little but tom_sawyer said why it just as easy if i a knowed this was all i a learnt long ago
why many a time i ve looked at people smoking and thought well i wish i could do that but i never thought i could said tom_sawyer
so would i said joe_harper it just nothing that just the way with me haint it huck_finn you ve heard me talk just that way
havent you huck_finn i ll leave it to huck_finn if i havent yes heaps of time said huck_finn well i have too said tom_sawyer
oh hundreds of time once down by the slaughter house dont you remember huck_finn bob tanner was there and johnny miller and jeff_thatcher becky_thatcher when i said it
dont you remember huck_finn bout me saying that yes that so said huck_finn that was the day after i lost a white alley
no twas the day before there i told you so said tom_sawyer huck_finn recollects it i bleeve i could smoke this pipe all day said joe_harper
i dont feel sick neither do i said tom_sawyer i could smoke it all day but i bet you jeff_thatcher becky_thatcher couldnt
jeff_thatcher becky_thatcher why he keel over just with two draws just let him try it once he see i bet he would
and johnny miller i wish could see johnny miller tackle it once oh dont i said joe_harper why i bet you johnny miller couldnt any more do this than nothing
just one little snifter would fetch him deed it would joe_harper say i wish the boy could see us now
say boy dont say anything about it and some time when they re around i ll come up to you and say joe_harper got a pipe
and you ll say kind of careless like as if it warnt anything you ll say yes i got my old pipe and another one but my tobacker aint very good
so do i i want a smoke and i ll say oh that all right if it strong enough and then you ll out with the pipes and we ll light up just as ca and then just see em look
by jings that ll be gay tom_sawyer i wish it was now so do i and when we tell em we learned when we was off pirating wont they wish they been along
oh i reckon not i ll just bet they will so the talk ran on but presently it began to flag a trifle and grow disjointed
every pore inside the boy cheeks became a spouting fountain they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tongues fast enough to prevent an inundation little overflowings down their throats occurred in spite of all they could do and sudden retchings followed every time
the silences widened the expectoration marvellously increased both boy were looking very pale and miserable now joe_harper pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers
tom_sawyer followed both fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with might and main joe_harper said feebly i ve lost my knife
i reckon i better go and find it tom_sawyer said with quivering lips and halting utterance i ll help you you go over that way
and i ll hunt around by the spring no you neednt come huck_finn we can find it so huck_finn sat down again and waited an hour
then he found it lonesome and went to find his comrades they were wide apart in the woods both very pale both fast asleep
but something informed him that if they had had any trouble they had got rid of it they were not talkative at supper that night
they had a humble look and when huck_finn prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to prepare theirs they said no they were not feeling very well something they ate at dinner had disagreed with them
about midnight joe_harper awoke and called the boy there was a brooding oppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something
the boy huddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship of the fire though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere was stifling
they sat still intent and waiting the solemn hush continued beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up in the blackness of darkness
presently there came a quivering glow that vaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished by and by another came a little stronger
then a faint moan came sighing through the branches of the forest and the boy felt a fleeting breath upon their cheeks and shuddered with the fancy that the spirit of the night had gone by
now a weird flash turned night into day and showed every little grassblade separate and distinct that grew about their feet
a deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumbling down the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance
then another there was a pause and it showed three white startled faces too a sweep of chilly air passed by rustling all the leaves and snowing the flaky ashes broadcast about the fire
another fierce glare lit up the forest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetops right over the boy heads
they clung together in terror in the thick gloom that followed a few big raindrops fell pattering upon the leaves
quick boy go for the tent exclaimed tom_sawyer they sprang away stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark no two plunging in the same direction
a furious blast roared through the trees making everything sing as it went one blinding flash after another came and peal on peal of deafening thunder
and now a drenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheets along the ground the boy cried out to each other but the roaring wind and the booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly
however one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter under the tent cold scared and streaming with water but to have company in misery seemed something to be grateful for
the tempest rose higher and higher and presently the sail tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast
the boy seized each others hands and fled with many tumblings and bruises to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank
they could not talk the old sail flapped so furiously even if the other noises would have allowed them now the battle was at its highest
under the ceaseless conflagration of lightning that flamed in the skies everything below stood out in cleancut and shadowless distinctness the bending trees the billowy river white with foam the driving spray of spumeflakes the dim outlines of the high bluffs on the other side glimpsed through the drifting cloudrack and the slanting veil of rain
every little while some giant tree yielded the fight and fell crashing through the younger growth and the unflagging thunderpeals came now in ear splitting explosive bursts keen and sharp and unspeakably appalling
the storm culminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the island to pieces burn it up drown it to the treetops blow it away and deafen every creature in it all at one and the same moment
but at last the battle was done and the forces retired with weaker and weaker threatenings and grumblings and peace resumed her sway
the boy went back to camp a good deal awed but they found there was still something to be thankful for because the great sycamore the shelter of their beds was a ruin now blasted by the lightnings and they were not under it when the catastrophe happened
everything in camp was drenched the campfire as well for they were but heedless lads like their generation and had made no provision against rain
it was a wild night for homeless young heads to be out in here was matter for dismay for they were soaked through and chilled
they were eloquent in their distress but they presently discovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it had been built against where it curved upward and separated itself from the ground that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting so they patiently wrought until
with shreds and bark gathered from the under sides of sheltered logs they coaxed the fire to burn again then they piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace and were gladhearted once more
they dried their boiled ham and had a feast and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorified their midnight adventure until morning for there was not a dry spot to sleep on anywhere around
as the sun began to steal in upon the boy drowsiness came over them and they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep
they got scorched out by and by and drearily set about getting breakfast after the meal they felt rusty and stiff jointed and a little homesick once more
tom_sawyer saw the signs and fell to cheering up the pirates as well as he could but they cared nothing for marbles or circus or swimming or anything
he reminded them of the imposing secret and raised a ray of cheer while it lasted he got them interested in a new device
they were attracted by this idea so it was not long before they were stripped and striped from head to heel with black mud like so many zebras all of them chiefs of course and then they went tearing through the woods to attack an english settlement
by and by they separated into three hostile tribes and darted upon each other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops and killed and scalped each other by thousands
this was to knock off being pirates for a while and be indians for a change it was a gory day
they assembled in camp toward suppertime hungry and happy but now a difficulty arose hostile indians could not break the bread of hospitality together without first making peace and this was a simple impossibility without smoking a pipe of peace
consequently it was an extremely satisfactory one there was no other process that ever they had heard of two of the savages almost wished they had remained pirates
however there was no other way so with such show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipe and took their whiff as it passed in due form
and behold they were glad they had gone into savagery for they had gained something they found that they could now smoke a little without having to go and hunt for a lost knife they did not get sick enough to be seriously uncomfortable
they were not likely to fool away this high promise for lack of effort no they practised cautiously after supper with right fair success and so they spent a jubilant evening
they were prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been in the scalping and skinning of the six nations
we will leave them to smoke and chatter and brag since we have no further use for them at present chapter xvii
but there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil saturday afternoon the harpers and aunt_polly family were being put into mourning with great grief and many tears
an unusual quiet possessed the village although it was ordinarily quiet enough in all conscience the villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air and talked little but they sighed often
the saturday holiday seemed a burden to the children they had no heart in their sports and gradually gave them up
in the afternoon becky_thatcher found herself moping about the deserted schoolhouse yard and feeling very melancholy but she found nothing there to comfort her
she soliloquized oh if i only had a brass andiron knob again but i havent got anything now to remember him by
and she choked back a little sob presently she stopped and said to herself it was right here oh if it was to do over again i wouldnt say that
i wouldnt say it for the whole world but he gone now i ll never never never see him any more
then quite a group of boy and girl playmates of tom_sawyer and joe_harper came by and stood looking over the paling fence and talking in reverent tones of how tom_sawyer did so and so the last time they saw him and how joe_harper said this and that small trifle pregnant with awful prophecy as they could easily see now and each speaker pointed out the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time and then added something like and i was a standing just so just as i am now and as if you was him i was as close as that and he smiled just this way and then something seemed to go all over me like awful you know and i never thought what it meant of course but i can see now
then there was a dispute about who saw the dead boy last in life and many claimed that dismal distinction and offered evidences more or less tampered with by the witness and when it was ultimately decided who did see the departed last and exchanged the last words with them the lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance and were gaped at and envied by all the rest
one poor chap who had no other grandeur to offer said with tolerably manifest pride in the remembrance well tom_sawyer he licked me once
this thought broke her down and she wandered away with tears rolling down her cheeks but that bid for glory was a failure
most of the boy could say that and so that cheapened the distinction too much the group loitered away still recalling memory of the lost hero in awed voices
when the sunday school hour was finished the next morning the bell began to toll instead of ringing in the usual way
it was a very still sabbath and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush that lay upon nature
but there was no whispering in the house only the funereal rustling of dresses as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there
the villagers began to gather loitering a moment in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event none could remember when the little church had been so full before
there was finally a waiting pause an expectant dumbness and then aunt_polly entered followed by sid and mary and they by the joe_harper family all in deep black and the whole congregation the old minister as well rose reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew
there was another communing silence broken at intervals by muffled sobs and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed
as the service proceeded the clergyman drew such pictures of the graces the winning way and the rare promise of the lost lads that every soul there thinking he recognized these pictures felt a pang in remembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them always before and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poor boy
the minister related many a touching incident in the life of the departed too which illustrated their sweet generous natures and the people could easily see now how noble and beautiful those episodes were and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they had seemed rank rascalities well deserving of the cowhide
the congregation became more and more moved as the pathetic tale went on till at last the whole company broke down and joined the weeping mourners in a chorus of anguished sobs the preacher himself giving way to his feelings and crying in the pulpit
there was a rustle in the gallery which nobody noticed a moment later the church door creaked the minister raised his streaming eyes above his handkerchief and stood transfixed
first one and then another pair of eyes followed the minister and then almost with one impulse the congregation rose and stared while the three dead boy came marching up the aisle tom_sawyer in the lead joe_harper next and huck_finn a ruin of drooping rags sneaking sheepishly in the rear
a moving hymn was sung and the text followed i am the resurrection and the life they had been hid in the unused gallery listening to their own funeral sermon
aunt_polly mary and the harpers threw themselves upon their restored ones smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings while poor huck_finn stood abashed and uncomfortable not knowing exactly what to do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes
he wavered and started to slink away but tom_sawyer seized him and said aunt_polly it aint fair somebody got to be glad to see huck_finn
and the loving attentions aunt_polly lavished upon him were the one thing capable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before
and so they shall i glad to see him poor motherless thing suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice
old hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst and while it shook the rafters tom_sawyer the pirate looked around upon the envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the proudest moment of his life
as the sold congregation trooped out they said they would almost be willing to be made ridiculous again to hear old hundred sung like that once more
tom_sawyer got more cuffs and kisses that day according to aunt_polly varying moods than he had earned before in a year and he hardly knew which expressed the most gratefulness to god and affection for himself
praise god from whom all blessings flow sing and put your heart in it and they did chapter xviii
they had paddled over to the missouri shore on a log at dusk on saturday landing five or six miles below the village they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town till nearly daylight and had then crept through back lanes and alleys and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of invalided benches
that was tom_sawyer great secret the scheme to return home with his brother pirates and attend their own funerals at breakfast monday morning aunt_polly and mary were very loving to tom_sawyer and very attentive to his wants
there was an unusual amount of talk in the course of it aunt_polly said well i dont say it wasnt a fine joke tom_sawyer to keep everybody suffering most a week
so you boy had a good time but it is a pity you could be so hard hearted as to let me suffer so
if you could come over on a log to go to your funeral you could have come over and give me a hint some way that you warnt dead but only run off
yes you could have done that tom_sawyer said mary and i believe you would if you had thought of it
would you tom_sawyer said aunt_polly her face lighting wistfully say now would you if you thought of it
i well i dont know twould a spoiled everything tom_sawyer i hoped you loved me that much said aunt_polly with a grieved tone that discomforted the boy
now auntie that aint any harm pleaded mary it only tom_sawyer giddy way he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything
it would have been something if you cared enough to think of it even if you didnt do it
tom_sawyer you ll look back some day when it too late and wish you cared a little more for me when it would have cost you so little
more the pity sid would have thought and sid would have come and done it too now auntie you know i do care for you said tom_sawyer
i know it better if you acted more like it i wish now i thought said tom_sawyer with a repentant tone but i dreamt about you anyway
that something aint it it aint much a cat does that much but it better than nothing what did you dream
why wednesday night i dreamt that you was sitting over there by the bed and sid was sitting by the woodbox and mary next to him
well so we did so we always do i glad your dreams could take even that much trouble about us
and i dreamt that joe_harper mother was here why she was here did you dream any more
oh lots but it so dim now well try to recollect cant you somehow it seems to me that the wind the wind blowed the the
try harder tom_sawyer the wind did blow something come tom_sawyer pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute and then said i ve got it now
i ve got it now it blowed the candle mercy on us go on tom_sawyer go on and it seems to me that you said why i believe that that door
go on tom_sawyer just let me study a moment just a moment oh yes you said you believed the door was open
as i sitting here i did didnt i mary go on and then and then well i wont be certain but it seems like as if you made sid go and and
well well what did i make him do tom_sawyer what did i make him do you made him you oh you made him shut it
well for the land sake i never heard the beat of that in all my days dont tell me there aint anything in dreams any more
sereny joe_harper shall know of this before i an hour older i like to see her get around this with her rubbage bout superstition
go on tom_sawyer oh it all getting just as bright as day now next you said i warnt bad only mischeevous and harum scarum and not any more responsible than
than i think it was a colt or something and so it was well goodness gracious go on tom_sawyer
and then you began to cry so i did so i did not the first time neither and then
then mrs joe_harper she began to cry and said joe_harper was just the same and she wished she hadnt whipped him for taking cream when she throwed it out her own self
tom_sawyer the sperrit was upon you you was a prophesying that what you was doing land alive go on tom_sawyer
then sid he said he said i dont think i said anything said sid yes you did sid said mary
he said i think he said he hoped i was better off where i was gone to but if i been better sometimes
shut your heads and let tom_sawyer go on what did he say tom_sawyer there you hear that
it was his very words and you shut him up sharp i lay i did there must a been an angel there
and mrs joe_harper told about joe_harper scaring her with a firecracker and you told about peter and the pain killer just as true as i live
and then there was a whole lot of talk bout dragging the river for us and bout having the funeral sunday and then you and old miss joe_harper hugged and cried and she went
there was an angel there somewheres it happened just so it happened just so as sure as i a sitting in these very tracks
tom_sawyer you couldnt told it more like if you a seen it and then what go on tom_sawyer then i thought you prayed for me and i could see you and hear every word you said
and you went to bed and i was so sorry that i took and wrote on a piece of sycamore bark we aint dead we are only off being pirates and put it on the table by the candle and then you looked so good laying there asleep that i thought i went and leaned over and kissed you on the lips
did you tom_sawyer did you i just forgive you everything for that and she seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like the guiltiest of villains
it was very kind even though it was only a dream sid soliloquized just audibly shut up sid a body does just the same in a dream as he do if he was awake
here a big milum apple i ve been saving for you tom_sawyer if you was ever found again now go long to school
that long suffering and merciful to them that believe on him and keep his word though goodness knows i unworthy of it but if only the worthy ones got his blessings and had his hand to help them over the rough places there few enough would smile here or ever enter into his rest when the long night comes
i thankful to the good god and father of us all i ve got you back go long sid mary tom_sawyer take yourselves off you ve hendered me long enough
the children left for school and the old lady to call on mrs joe_harper and vanquish her realism with tom_sawyer marvellous dream
sid had better judgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left the house it was this pretty thin as long a dream as that without any mistakes in it
he did not go skipping and prancing but moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that the public eye was on him
and indeed it was he tried not to seem to see the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along but they were food and drink to him
smaller boy than himself flocked at his heels as proud to be seen with him and tolerated by him as if he had been the drummer at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into town
boy of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at all but they were consuming with envy nevertheless
they would have given anything to have that swarthy sun tanned skin of his and his glittering notoriety and tom_sawyer would not have parted with either for a circus
at school the children made so much of him and of joe_harper and delivered such eloquent admiration from their eyes that the two hero were not long in becoming insufferably stuck up
they began to tell their adventures to hungry listeners but they only began it was not a thing likely to have an end with imaginations like theirs to furnish material
what a hero tom_sawyer was become now and finally when they got out their pipes and went serenely puffing around the very summit of glory was reached
tom_sawyer decided that he could be independent of becky_thatcher now glory was sufficient he would live for glory now that he was distinguished maybe she would be wanting to make up
well let her she should see that he could be as indifferent as some other people presently she arrived tom_sawyer pretended not to see her
soon he observed that she was tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates and screaming with laughter when she made a capture but he noticed that she always made her captures in his vicinity and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye in his direction at such time too
it gratified all the vicious vanity that was in him and so instead of winning him it only set him up the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she was about
he moved away and joined a group of boy and girl and began to talk presently she gave over skylarking and moved irresolutely about sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and wistfully toward tom_sawyer
then she observed that now tom_sawyer was talking more particularly to amy_lawrence than to any one else she felt a sharp pang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once
she tried to go away but her feet were treacherous and carried her to the group instead she said to a girl almost at tom_sawyer elbow with sham vivacity
why mary austin you bad girl why didnt you come to sunday school i did come didnt you see me why no
did you where did you sit i was in miss peters class where i always go i saw you
did you why it funny i didnt see you i wanted to tell you about the picnic oh that jolly
who going to give it my ma going to let me have one oh goody i hope she ll let me come
well she will the picnic for me she ll let anybody come that i want and i want you
that ever so nice when is it going to be by and by maybe about vacation oh wont it be fun
yes every one that friends to me or wants to be and she glanced ever so furtively at tom_sawyer but he talked right along to amy_lawrence about the terrible storm on the island and how the lightning tore the great sycamore tree all to flinders while he was standing within three feet of it
you going to have all the girl and boy oh may i come said grace miller yes
and me said sally rogers yes and me too said susy joe_harper and joe_harper yes and so on with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged for invitations but
becky_thatcher lips trembled and the tears came to her eyes she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on chattering but the life had gone out of the picnic now and out of everything else she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and had what her sex call a good cry
tom_sawyer and amy_lawrence then tom_sawyer turned coolly away still talking and took amy_lawrence with him then she sat moody with wounded pride till the bell rang
she roused up now with a vindictive cast in her eye and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what she do
at recess tom_sawyer continued his flirtation with amy_lawrence with jubilant self satisfaction and he kept drifting about to find becky_thatcher and lacerate her with the performance
she was sitting cosily on a little bench behind the schoolhouse looking at a picture book with alfred temple and so absorbed were they and their heads so close together over the book that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides
at last he spied her but there was a sudden falling of his mercury jealousy ran red hot through tom_sawyer veins he began to hate himself for throwing away the chance becky_thatcher had offered for a reconciliation
he called himself a fool and all the hard names he could think of he wanted to cry with vexation amy_lawrence chatted happily along as they walked for her heart was singing but tom_sawyer tongue had lost its function
he did not hear what amy_lawrence was saying and whenever she paused expectantly he could only stammer an awkward assent which was as often misplaced as otherwise
he kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse again and again to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there
and it maddened him to see as he thought he saw that becky_thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the living
but she did see nevertheless and she knew she was winning her fight too and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered
he could not help it amy_lawrence happy prattle became intolerable tom_sawyer hinted at thing he had to attend to thing that must be done and time was fleeting
at last he must be attending to those thing and she said artlessly that she would be around when school let out
but in vain the girl chirped on tom_sawyer thought oh hang her aint i ever going to get rid of her and he hastened away hating her for it
any other boy tom_sawyer thought grating his teeth any boy in the whole town but that saint louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is aristocracy
oh all right i licked you the first day you ever saw this town mister and i ll lick you again you just wait till i catch you out
i ll just take and and he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy pummelling the air and kicking and gouging
oh you do do you you holler nough do you now then let that learn you and so the imaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction
his conscience could not endure any more of amy_lawrence grateful happiness and his jealousy could bear no more of the other distress
becky_thatcher resumed her picture inspections with alfred but as the minute dragged along and no tom_sawyer came to suffer her triumph began to cloud and she lost interest gravity and absentmindedness followed and then melancholy two or three time she pricked up her ear at a footstep but it was a false hope no tom_sawyer came
when poor alfred seeing that he was losing her he did not know how kept exclaiming oh here a jolly one look at this
tom_sawyer fled home at noon at last she grew entirely miserable and wished she hadnt carried it so far she lost patience at last and said oh dont bother me
alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her but she said go away and leave me alone cant you
so the boy halted wondering what he could have done for she had said she would look at pictures all through the nooning and she walked on crying
i dont care for them and burst into tears and got up and walked away i hate you then alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse
he easily guessed his way to the truth the girl had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon tom_sawyer
he was humiliated and angry he was far from hating tom_sawyer the less when this thought occurred to him he wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much risk to himself
tom_sawyer spelling book fell under his eye here was his opportunity he gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and poured ink upon the page
she started homeward now intending to find tom_sawyer and tell him tom_sawyer would be thankful and their troubles would be healed
becky_thatcher glancing in at a window behind him at the moment saw the act and moved on without discovering herself before she was half way home however she had changed her mind
the thought of tom_sawyer treatment of her when she was talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her with shame
chapter xix tom_sawyer arrived at home in a dreary mood and the first thing his aunt said to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to an unpromising market
she resolved to let him get whipped on the damaged spelling book account and to hate him forever into the bargain tom_sawyer i ve a notion to skin you alive
here i go over to sereny joe_harper like an old softy expecting i going to make her believe all that rubbage about that dream
when lo and behold you she found out from joe_harper that you was over here and heard all the talk we had that night
auntie what have i done well you ve done enough tom_sawyer i dont know what is to become of a boy that will act like that
it makes me feel so bad to think you could let me go to sereny joe_harper and make such a fool of myself and never say a word
this was a new aspect of the thing his smartness of the morning had seemed to tom_sawyer a good joke before and very ingenious
it merely looked mean and shabby now he hung his head and could not think of anything to say for a moment
then he said auntie i wish i hadnt done it but i didnt think oh child you never think you never think of anything but your own selfishness
you could think to come all the way over here from jackson island in the night to laugh at our troubles and you could think to fool me with a lie about a dream but you couldnt ever think to pity us and save us from sorrow
auntie i know now it was mean but i didnt mean to be mean i didnt honest and besides i didnt come over here to laugh at you that night
what did you come for then it was to tell you not to be uneasy about us because we hadnt got drownded
tom_sawyer tom i would be the thankfullest soul in this world if i could believe you ever had as good a thought as that but you know you never did and i know it tom_sawyer
indeed and deed i did auntie i wish i may never stir if i didnt oh tom_sawyer dont lie dont do it
it only makes thing a hundred time worse it aint a lie auntie it the truth i wanted to keep you from grieving that was all that made me come
i give the whole world to believe that it would cover up a power of sins tom_sawyer i most be glad you run off and acted so bad
why you see when you got to talking about the funeral i just got all full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church and i couldnt somehow bear to spoil it
but it aint reasonable because why didnt you tell me child so i just put the bark back in my pocket and kept mum
what bark the bark i had wrote on to tell you we gone pirating i wish now you waked up when i kissed you i do honest
the hard lines in his aunt face relaxed and a sudden tenderness dawned in her eyes did you kiss me tom_sawyer
why yes i did are you sure you did tom_sawyer why yes i did auntie certain sure what did you kiss me for tom_sawyer
because i loved you so and you laid there moaning and i was so sorry the words sounded like truth
the old lady could not hide a tremor in her voice when she said kiss me again tom_sawyer and be off with you to school now and dont bother me any more
the moment he was gone she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of a jacket which tom_sawyer had gone pirating in
then she stopped with it in her hand and said to herself no i dont dare poor boy i reckon he lied about it but it a blessed blessed lie there such a comfort come from it
i hope the lord i know the lord will forgive him because it was such good heartedness in him to tell it but i dont want to find out it a lie
i wont look she put the jacket away and stood by musing a minute twice she put out her hand to take the garment again and twice she refrained
once more she ventured and this time she fortified herself with the thought it a good lie it a good lie i wont let it grieve me
a moment later she was reading tom_sawyer piece of bark through flowing tears and saying i could forgive the boy now if he committed a million sins
so she sought the jacket pocket chapter xx there was something about aunt_polly manner when she kissed tom_sawyer that swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again
he started to school and had the luck of coming upon becky_thatcher at the head of meadow lane his mood always determined his manner
without a moment hesitation he ran to her and said i acted mighty mean today becky_thatcher and i so sorry i wont ever ever do that way again as long as ever i live please make up wont you
the girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the face i ll thank you to keep yourself to yourself mr thomas_sawyer
i ll never speak to you again she tossed her head and passed on tom_sawyer was so stunned that he had not even presence of mind enough to say who cares miss smarty
until the right time to say it had gone by so he said nothing but he was in a fine rage nevertheless
he moped into the schoolyard wishing she were a boy and imagining how he would trounce her if she were he presently encountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed
it seemed to becky_thatcher in her hot resentment that she could hardly wait for school to take in she was so impatient to see tom_sawyer flogged for the injured spelling book
she hurled one in return and the angry breach was complete if she had had any lingering notion of exposing alfred temple tom_sawyer offensive fling had driven it entirely away
poor girl she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself the master mr dobbins had reached middle age with an unsatisfied ambition
the darling of his desires was to be a doctor but poverty had decreed that he should be nothing higher than a village schoolmaster
every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk and absorbed himself in it at time when no classes were reciting
there was not an urchin in school but was perishing to have a glimpse of it but the chance never came
every boy and girl had a theory about the nature of that book but no two theories were alike and there was no way of getting at the facts in the case
now as becky_thatcher was passing by the desk which stood near the door she noticed that the key was in the lock
he kept that book under lock and key it was a precious moment she glanced around found herself alone and the next instant she had the book in her hands
the titlepage professor somebody anatomy carried no information to her mind so she began to turn the leaves she came at once upon a handsomely engraved and colored frontispiece a human figure stark naked
at that moment a shadow fell on the page and tom_sawyer stepped in at the door and caught a glimpse of the picture
becky_thatcher snatched at the book to close it and had the hard luck to tear the pictured page half down the middle
tom_sawyer you are just as mean as you can be to sneak up on a person and look at what they re looking at
she thrust the volume into the desk turned the key and burst out crying with shame and vexation how could i know you was looking at anything
you ought to be ashamed of yourself tom_sawyer you know you re going to tell on me and oh what shall i do
what shall i do i ll be whipped and i never was whipped in school then she stamped her little foot and said be so mean if you want to
i know something that going to happen you just wait and you ll see hateful hateful hateful and she flung out of the house with a new explosion of crying
tom_sawyer stood still rather flustered by this onslaught presently he said to himself what a curious kind of a fool a girl is
well of course i aint going to tell old dobbins on this little fool because there other way of getting even on her that aint so mean but what of it
never been licked in school shucks what a licking that just like a girl they re so thin skinned and chicken hearted old dobbins will ask who it was tore his book
then he ll do just the way he always does ask first one and thent other and when he comes to the right girl he ll know it without any telling
nobody ll answer girl faces always tell on them they aint got any backbone she ll get licked well it a kind of a tight place for becky_thatcher because there aint any way out of it
tom_sawyer conned the thing a moment longer and then added all right though she like to see me in just such a fix let her sweat it out
tom_sawyer joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside in a few moments the master arrived and school took in
tom_sawyer did not feel a strong interest in his studies every time he stole a glance at the girl side of the room becky_thatcher face troubled him
considering all thing he did not want to pity her and yet it was all he could do to help it
presently the spelling book discovery was made and tom_sawyer mind was entirely full of his own matters for a while after that
he could get up no exultation that was really worthy the name becky_thatcher roused up from her lethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings
she did not expect that tom_sawyer could get out of his trouble by denying that he spilt the ink on the book himself and she was right
becky_thatcher supposed she would be glad of that and she tried to believe she was glad of it but she found she was not certain
when the worst came to the worst she had an impulse to get up and tell on alfred temple but she made an effort and forced herself to keep still because said she to herself he ll tell about me tearing the picture sure
the denial only seemed to make the thing worse for tom_sawyer i wouldnt say a word not to save his life
tom_sawyer took his whipping and went back to his seat not at all broken hearted for he thought it was possible that he had unknowingly upset the ink on the spelling book himself in some skylarking bout he had denied it for form sake and because it was custom and had stuck to the denial from principle
a whole hour drifted by the master sat nodding in his throne the air was drowsy with the hum of study
by and by mr dobbins straightened himself up yawned then unlocked his desk and reached for his book but seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it
mr dobbins fingered his book absently for a while then took it out and settled himself in his chair to read
most of the pupils glanced up languidly but there were two among them that watched his movements with intent eyes tom_sawyer shot a glance at becky_thatcher
he had seen a hunted and helpless rabbit look as she did with a gun levelled at its head instantly he forgot his quarrel with her
quick something must be done done in a flash too but the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention good he had an inspiration
he would run and snatch the book spring through the door and fly but his resolution shook for one little instant and the chance was lost the master opened the volume
if tom_sawyer only had the wasted opportunity back again too late there was no help for becky_thatcher now he said the next moment the master faced the school
every eye sank under his gaze there was that in it which smote even the innocent with fear there was silence while one might count ten the master was gathering his wrath
then he spoke who tore this book there was not a sound one could have heard a pin drop the stillness continued the master searched face after face for signs of guilt
benjamin rogers did you tear this book a denial another pause joseph joe_harper did you another denial tom_sawyer uneasiness grew more and more intense under the slow torture of these proceedings
the master scanned the ranks of boy considered a while then turned to the girl amy_lawrence a shake of the head
gracie miller the same sign susan joe_harper did you do this another negative the next girl was becky_thatcher
tom_sawyer was trembling from head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness of the situation rebecca becky_thatcher
tom_sawyer glanced at her face it was white with terror did you tear no look me in the face her hands rose in appeal did you tear this book
a thought shot like lightning through tom_sawyer brain he sprang to his feet and shouted i done it the school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly
tom_sawyer stood a moment to gather his dismembered faculties and when he stepped forward to go to his punishment the surprise the gratitude the adoration that shone upon him out of poor becky_thatcher eyes seemed pay enough for a hundred floggings
inspired by the splendor of his own act he took without an outcry the most merciless flaying that even mr dobbins had ever administered and also received with indifference the added cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school should be dismissed for he knew who would wait for him outside till his captivity was done and not count the tedious time as loss either
tom_sawyer went to bed that night planning vengeance against alfred temple for with shame and repentance becky_thatcher had told him all not forgetting her own treachery but even the longing for vengeance had to give way soon to pleasanter musings and he fell asleep at last with becky_thatcher latest words lingering dreamily in his ear
the schoolmaster always severe grew severer and more exacting than ever for he wanted the school to make a good showing on examination day
tom_sawyer how could you be so noble chapter xxi vacation was approaching his rod and his ferule were seldom idle now at least among the smaller pupils
mr dobbins lashings were very vigorous ones too for although he carried under his wig a perfectly bald and shiny head he had only reached middle age and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle
as the great day approached all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface he seemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the least shortcomings
only the biggest boy and young ladies of eighteen and twenty escaped lashing the consequence was that the smaller boy spent their days in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge
the retribution that followed every vengeful success was so sweeping and majestic that the boy always retired from the field badly worsted
they threw away no opportunity to do the master a mischief but he kept ahead all the time at last they conspired together and hit upon a plan that promised a dazzling victory
he had his own reasons for being delighted for the master boarded in his father family and had given the boy ample cause to hate him
the master wife would go on a visit to the country in a few days and there would be nothing to interfere with the plan the master always prepared himself for great occasions by getting pretty well fuddled and the signpainter boy said that when the dominie had reached the proper condition on examination evening he would manage the thing while he napped in his chair then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurried away to school
they swore in the signpainter boy told him the scheme and asked his help in the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived
at eight in the evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted and adorned with wreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers the master sat throned in his great chair upon a raised platform with his blackboard behind him
three rows of benches on each side and six rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the town and by the parents of the pupils
to his left back of the rows of citizens was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated the scholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening rows of small boy washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfort rows of gawky big boy snowbanks of girl and young ladies clad in lawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms their grandmothers ancient trinkets their bit of pink and blue ribbon and the flowers in their hair
a very little boy stood up and sheepishly recited you scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on the stage etc accompanying himself with the painfully exact and spasmodic gestures which a machine might have used supposing the machine to be a trifle out of order
but he got through safely though cruelly scared and got a fine round of applause when he made his manufactured bow and retired
a little shamefaced girl lisped mary had a little lamb etc performed a compassion inspiring curtsy got her meed of applause and sat down flushed and happy
tom_sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared into the unquenchable and indestructible give me liberty or give me death speech with fine fury and frantic gesticulation and broke down in the middle of it
he was looking tolerably mellow all the rest of the house was filled with non participating scholars the exercises began a ghastly stage fright seized him his legs quaked under him
true he had the manifest sympathy of the house but he had the house silence too which was even worse than its sympathy
and he was like to choke the master frowned and this completed the disaster tom_sawyer struggled awhile and then retired utterly defeated
there was a weak attempt at applause but it died early the boy stood on the burning deck followed also the assyrian came down and other declamatory gems
then there were reading exercises and a spelling fight the meagre latin class recited with honor the prime feature of the evening was in order now original compositions by the young ladies
each in her turn stepped forward to the edge of the platform cleared her throat held up her manuscript tied with dainty ribbon and proceeded to read with labored attention to expression and punctuation
the themes were the same that had been illuminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them their grandmothers and doubtless all their ancestors in the female line clear back to the crusades
memory of other days religion in history dream land the advantages of culture forms of political government compared and contrasted melancholy filial love heart longings etc etc
a prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and petted melancholy another was a wasteful and opulent gush of fine language another was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized words and phrases until they were worn entirely out and a peculiarity that conspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerable sermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every one of them
no matter what the subject might be a brainracking effort was made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral and religious mind could contemplate with edification
the glaring insincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass the banishment of the fashion from the schools and it is not sufficient today it never will be sufficient while the world stands perhaps
there is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feel obliged to close their compositions with a sermon and you will find that the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl in the school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious
friendship was one but enough of this homely truth is unpalatable let us return to the examination the first composition that was read was one entitled
in the common walks of life with what delightful emotions does the youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity
is this then life perhaps the reader can endure an extract from it imagination is busy sketching rose tinted pictures of joy
her graceful form arrayed in snowy robes is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance her eye is brightest her step is lightest in the gay assembly
in such delicious fancies time quickly glides by and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into the elysian world of which she has had such bright dreams
in fancy the voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng the observed of all observers how fairy like does everything appear to her enchanted vision
but after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior all is vanity the flattery which once charmed her soul now grates harshly upon her ear the ballroom has lost its charms and with wasted health and imbittered heart she turns away with the conviction that earthly pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soul
each new scene is more charming than the last and so forth and so on there was a buzz of gratification from time to time during the reading accompanied by whispered ejaculations of how sweet
how eloquent so true etc and after the thing had closed with a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic
then arose a slim melancholy girl whose face had the interesting paleness that comes of pills and indigestion and read a poem
two stanzas of it will do a missouri maiden farewell to alabama alabama goodbye i love thee well but yet for a while do i leave thee now
for i have wandered through thy flowery woods have roamed and read near tallapoosa stream have listened to tallassee warring floods and wooed on coosa side aurora beam
yet shame i not to bear an erfull heart nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes tis from no stranger land i now must part tis to no strangers left i yield these sighs
sad yes sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell and burning recollections throng my brow welcome and home were mine within this state
whose vales i leave whose spires fade fast from me and cold must be mine eyes and heart and tete when dear alabama
they turn cold on thee there were very few there who knew what tete meant but the poem was very satisfactory nevertheless
next appeared a dark complexioned black eyed black haired young lady who paused an impressive moment assumed a tragic expression and began to read in a measured solemn tone a vision
around the throne on high not a single star quivered but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly vibrated upon the ear whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven seeming to scorn the power exerted over its terror by the illustrious franklin
even the boisterous wind unanimously came forth from their mystic homes and blustered about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene
at such a time so dark so dreary for human sympathy my very spirit sighed but instead thereof my dearest friend my counsellor my comforter and guide my joy in grief my second bliss in joy came to my side
she moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancy eden by the romantic and young a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own transcendent loveliness
so soft was her step it failed to make even a sound and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch as other unobtrusive beauties she would have glided away unperceived unsought
a strange sadness rested upon her features like icy tears upon the robe of december as she pointed to the contending elements without and bade me contemplate the two beings presented
this nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up with a sermon so destructive of all hope to non presbyterians that it took the first prize
the mayor of the village in delivering the prize to the author of it made a warm speech in which he said that it was by far the most eloquent thing he had ever listened to and that daniel webster himself might well be proud of it
it may be remarked in passing that the number of compositions in which the word beauteous was over fondled and human experience referred to as life page was up to the usual average
now the master mellow almost to the verge of geniality put his chair aside turned his back to the audience and began to draw a map of america on the blackboard to exercise the geography class upon
dark and tempestuous was night this composition was considered to be the very finest effort of the evening but he made a sad business of it with his unsteady hand and a smothered titter rippled over the house
he sponged out lines and remade them but he only distorted them more than ever and the tittering was more pronounced
he knew what the matter was and set himself to right it he threw his entire attention upon his work now as if determined not to be put down by the mirth
he felt that all eyes were fastened upon him he imagined he was succeeding and yet the tittering continued it even manifestly increased
there was a garret above pierced with a scuttle over his head and down through this scuttle came a cat suspended around the haunches by a string she had a rag tied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing as she slowly descended she curved upward and clawed at the string she swung downward and clawed at the intangible air
the tittering rose higher and higher the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teacher head down down a little lower and she grabbed his wig with her desperate claws clung to it and was snatched up into the garret in an instant with her trophy still in her possession
and well it might and how the light did blaze abroad from the master bald pate for the signpainter boy had gilded it
note the pretended compositions quoted in this chapter are taken without alteration from a volume entitled prose and poetry by a western lady but
that broke up the meeting the boy were avenged vacation had come they are exactly and precisely after the schoolgirl pattern and hence are much happier than any mere imitations could be
chapter xxii tom_sawyer joined the new order of cadets of temperance being attracted by the showy character of their regalia
now he found out a new thing namely that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing
tom_sawyer soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink and swear the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of a chance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawing from the order
fourth of july was coming but he soon gave that up gave it up before he had worn his shackles over forty eight hours and fixed his hopes upon old judge frazer justice of the peace who was apparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral since he was so high an official
he promised to abstain from smoking chewing and profanity as long as he remained a member during three days tom_sawyer was deeply concerned about the judge condition and hungry for news of it
sometimes his hopes ran high so high that he would venture to get out his regalia and practise before the looking glass but the judge had a most discouraging way of fluctuating
at last he was pronounced upon the mend and then convalescent tom_sawyer was disgusted and felt a sense of injury too he handed in his resignation at once and that night the judge suffered a relapse and died
tom_sawyer resolved that he would never trust a man like that again the funeral was a fine thing the cadets paraded in a style calculated to kill the late member with envy
tom_sawyer was a free boy again however there was something in that he could drink and swear now but found to his surprise that he did not want to
the simple fact that he could took the desire away and the charm of it tom_sawyer presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginning to hang a little heavily on his hands
he attempted a diary but nothing happened during three days and so he abandoned it the first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town and made a sensation
even the glorious fourth was in some sense a failure for it rained hard there was no procession in consequence and the greatest man in the world as tom_sawyer supposed mr benton an actual united states senator proved an overwhelming disappointment for he was not twenty five feet high nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it
the boy played circus for three days afterward in tents made of rag carpeting admission three pins for boy two for girl and then circusing was abandoned
tom_sawyer and joe_harper got up a band of performers and were happy for two days a circus came a phrenologist and a mesmerizer came and went again and left the village duller and drearier than ever
there were some boy and girl parties but they were so few and so delightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder
becky_thatcher was gone to her constantinople home to stay with her parents during vacation so there was no bright side to life anywhere
the dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery it was a very cancer for permanency and pain then came the measles
during two long weeks tom_sawyer lay a prisoner dead to the world and its happenings he was very ill he was interested in nothing
when he got upon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown a melancholy change had come over everything and every creature
there had been a revival and everybody had got religion not only the adults but even the boy and girl tom_sawyer went about hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed sinful face but disappointment crossed him everywhere
he found joe_harper studying a testament and turned sadly away from the depressing spectacle he sought ben_rogers and found him visiting the poor with a basket of tracts
every boy he encountered added another ton to his depression and when in desperation he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of huckleberry_finn and was received with a scriptural quotation his heart broke and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost forever and forever
and that night there came on a terrific storm with driving rain awful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning
he covered his head with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for his doom for he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub was about him
he believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers above to the extremity of endurance and that this was the result
it might have seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with a battery of artillery but there seemed nothing incongruous about the getting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turf from under an insect like himself
he hunted up jim_hollis who called his attention to the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning by and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing its object
the boy first impulse was to be grateful and reform his second was to wait for there might not be any more storms
the next day the doctors were back tom_sawyer had relapsed the three weeks he spent on his back this time seemed an entire age
when he got abroad at last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared remembering how lonely was his estate
he drifted listlessly down the street and found jim_hollis acting as judge in a juvenile court that was trying a cat for murder in the presence of her victim a bird
how companionless and forlorn he was he found joe_harper and huck_finn up an alley eating a stolen melon
poor lads they like tom_sawyer had suffered a relapse chapter xxiii at last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred and vigorously the murder trial came on in the court
every reference to the murder sent a shudder to his heart for his troubled conscience and fears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in his hearing as feelers he did not see how he could be suspected of knowing anything about the murder but still he could not be comfortable in the midst of this gossip
it became the absorbing topic of village talk immediately tom_sawyer could not get away from it it kept him in a cold shiver all the time
it would be some relief to unseal his tongue for a little while to divide his burden of distress with another sufferer
he took huck_finn to a lonely place to have a talk with him moreover he wanted to assure himself that huck_finn had remained discreet
huck_finn have you ever told anybody about that bout what you know what oh course i havent
never a word never a solitary word so help me what makes you ask well i was afeard why tom_sawyer we wouldnt be alive two days if that got found out
you know that tom_sawyer felt more comfortable after a pause huck_finn they couldnt anybody get you to tell could they
get me to tell why if i wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd me they could get me to tell they aint no different way
well that all right then i reckon we re safe as long as we keep mum but let swear again anyway
it more surer i agreed so they swore again with dread solemnities what is the talk around huck_finn
i ve heard a power of it talk well it just muff_potter muff_potter muff_potter muff_potter all the time it keeps me in a sweat constant so i want to hide som ers
that just the same way they go on round me i reckon he a goner dont you feel sorry for him sometimes
just fishes a little to get money to get drunk on and loafs around considerable but lord we all do that leastways most of us preachers and such like
but he kind of good he give me half a fish once when there warnt enough for two and lots of time he kind of stood by me when i was out of luck
most always most always he aint no account but then he haint ever done anything to hurt anybody well he mended kites for me huck_finn and knitted hooks on to my line
i wish we could get him out of there my we couldnt get him out tom_sawyer and besides twouldnt do any good they ketch him again
yes so they would but i hate to hear em abuse him so like the dickens when he never done that
lord i hear em say he the bloodiest looking villain in this country and they wonder he wasnt ever hung before
i do too tom_sawyer yes they talk like that all the time i ve heard em say that if he was to get free they lynch him
as the twilight drew on they found themselves hanging about the neighborhood of the little isolated jail perhaps with an undefined hope that something would happen that might clear away their difficulties
and they do it too the boy had a long talk but it brought them little comfort but nothing happened there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested in this luckless captive
the boy did as they had often done before went to the cell grating and gave muff_potter some tobacco and matches he was on the ground floor and there were no guards
his gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciences before it cut deeper than ever this time they felt cowardly and treacherous to the last degree when muff_potter said you ve been mighty good to me boy
often i says to myself says i i used to mend all the boy kites and thing and show em where the good fishin places was and befriend em what i could
better anybody else in this town and i dont forget it i dont and now they ve all forgot old muff_potter when he in trouble but
well boy i done an awful thing drunk and crazy at the time that the only way i account for it and now i got to swing for it and
tom_sawyer dont and huck_finn dont they dont forget him says i and i dont forget them it right right and best
too i reckon hope so anyway well we wont talk about that i dont want to make you feel bad you ve befriended me
but what i want to say is dont you ever get drunk then you wont ever get here stand a litter furder west so
that it it a prime comfort to see faces that friendly when a body in such a muck of trouble and there dont none come here but yourn
good friendly faces good friendly faces git up on one another backs and let me touch em that it shake hands yourn ll come through the bars but mine too big
little hands and weak but they ve helped muff_potter a power and they help him more if they could tom_sawyer went home miserable and his dreams that night were full of horrors
the next day and the day after he hung about the courtroom drawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go in but forcing himself to stay out
huck_finn was having the same experience they studiously avoided each other each wandered away from time to time but the same dismal fascination always brought them back presently
tom_sawyer kept his ears open when idlers sauntered out of the courtroom but invariably heard distressing news the toils were closing more and more relentlessly around poor muff_potter
at the end of the second day the village talk was to the effect that injun joe_harper evidence stood firm and unshaken and that there was not the slightest question as to what the jury verdict would be
tom_sawyer was out late that night and came to bed through the window he was in a tremendous state of excitement
it was hours before he got to sleep all the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning for this was to be the great day
after a long wait the jury filed in and took their places shortly afterward muff_potter pale and haggard timid and hopeless was brought in with chains upon him and seated where all the curious eyes could stare at him no less conspicuous was injun joe_harper stolid as ever
both sexes were about equally represented in the packed audience there was another pause and then the judge arrived and the sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court
the usual whisperings among the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed these details and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparation that was as impressive as it was fascinating
now a witness was called who testified that he found muff_potter washing in the brook at an early hour of the morning that the murder was discovered and that he immediately sneaked away
the prisoner raised his eyes for a moment but dropped them again when his own counsel said i have no questions to ask him
after some further questioning counsel for the prosecution said take the witness the next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse
counsel for the prosecution said take the witness i have no questions to ask him muff_potter lawyer replied a third witness swore he had often seen the knife in muff_potter possession
take the witness counsel for muff_potter declined to question him the faces of the audience began to betray annoyance did this attorney mean to throw away his client life without an effort
several witnesses deposed concerning muff_potter guilty behavior when brought to the scene of the murder they were allowed to leave the stand without being cross questioned
every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in the graveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well was brought out by credible witnesses but none of them were cross examined by muff_potter lawyer
counsel for the prosecution now said by the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion we have fastened this awful crime beyond all possibility of question upon the unhappy prisoner at the bar
the perplexity and dissatisfaction of the house expressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench we rest our case here
a groan escaped from poor muff_potter and he put his face in his hands and rocked his body softly to and fro while a painful silence reigned in the courtroom
counsel for the defence rose and said your honor in our remarks at the opening of this trial we foreshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deed while under the influence of a blind and irresponsible delirium produced by drink
many men were moved and many women compassion testified itself in tears we have changed our mind we shall not offer that plea
then to the clerk call thomas_sawyer a puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house not even excepting muff_potter
every eye fastened itself with wondering interest upon tom_sawyer as he rose and took his place upon the stand the boy looked wild enough for he was badly scared
the oath was administered thomas_sawyer where were you on the seventeenth of june about the hour of midnight tom_sawyer glanced at injun joe_harper iron face and his tongue failed him
after a few moments however the boy got a little of his strength back and managed to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the house hear in the graveyard
the audience listened breathless but the words refused to come a little bit louder please dont be afraid you were
in the graveyard a contemptuous smile flitted across injun joe_harper face were you anywhere near horse williams grave
yes sir speak up just a trifle louder how near were you near as i am to you were you hidden or not
i was hid where behind the elms that on the edge of the grave injun joe_harper gave a barely perceptible start
any one with you yes sir i went there with wait wait a moment never mind mentioning your companion name
we will produce him at the proper time did you carry anything there with you tom_sawyer hesitated and looked confused
speak out my boy dont be diffident the truth is always respectable what did you take there only a a dead cat there was a ripple of mirth which the court checked
we will produce the skeleton of that cat now my boy tell us everything that occurred tell it in your own way dont skip anything and dont be afraid
tom_sawyer began hesitatingly at first but as he warmed to his subject his words flowed more and more easily in a little while every sound ceased but his own voice every eye fixed itself upon him with parted lips and bated breath the audience hung upon his words taking no note of time rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale
the strain upon pent emotion reached its climax when the boy said and as the doctor fetched the board around and muff_potter fell injun joe_harper jumped with the knife and crash
quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window tore his way through all opposers and was gone chapter xxiv tom_sawyer was a glittering hero once more the pet of the old the envy of the young
his name even went into immortal print for the village paper magnified him there were some that believed he would be president yet if he escaped hanging
as usual the fickle unreasoning world took muff_potter to its bosom and fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before
but that sort of conduct is to the world credit therefore it is not well to find fault with it tom_sawyer days were days of splendor and exultation to him but his nights were seasons of horror
injun joe_harper infested all his dreams and always with doom in his eye hardly any temptation could persuade the boy to stir abroad after nightfall
poor huck_finn was in the same state of wretchedness and terror for tom_sawyer had told the whole story to the lawyer the night before the great day of the trial and huck_finn was sore afraid that his share in the business might leak out yet notwithstanding
injun joe_harper flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court the poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy but what of that
since tom_sawyer harassed conscience had managed to drive him to the lawyer house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had been sealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths huck_finn confidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated
half the time tom_sawyer was afraid injun joe_harper would never be captured the other half he was afraid he would be
he felt sure he never could draw a safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse
daily muff_potter gratitude made tom_sawyer glad he had spoken but nightly he wished he had sealed up his tongue rewards had been offered the country had been scoured but no injun joe_harper was found
one of those omniscient and aweinspiring marvels a detective came up from st louis moused around shook his head looked wise and made that sort of astounding success which members of that craft usually achieve
but you cant hang a clew for murder and so after that detective had got through and gone home tom_sawyer felt just as insecure as he was before
that is to say he found a clew the slow days drifted on and each left behind it a slightly lightened weight of apprehension
chapter xxv there comes a time in every rightly constructed boy life when he has a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure
this desire suddenly came upon tom_sawyer one day he sallied out to find joe_harper but failed of success next he sought ben_rogers he had gone fishing
presently he stumbled upon huck_finn the red handed huck_finn would answer tom_sawyer took him to a private place and opened the matter to him confidentially
huck_finn was always willing to take a hand in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is not money
huck_finn was willing where ll we dig said huck_finn oh most anywhere why is it hid all around no indeed it aint
it hid in mighty particular places huck_finn sometimes on islands sometimes in rotten chests under the end of a limb of an old dead tree just where the shadow falls at midnight but mostly under the floor in ha nted houses
who hides it why robbers of course who you reckon sunday school sup rintendents i dont know if twas mine i wouldnt hide it i spend it and have a good time
so would i but robbers dont do that way they always hide it and leave it there dont they come after it any more
anyway it lays there a long time and gets rusty and by and by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find the marks a paper that got to be ciphered over about a week because it mostly signs and hy roglyphics
no they think they will but they generally forget the marks or else they die hyro which hy roglyphics pictures and thing you know that dont seem to mean anything
have you got one of them papers tom_sawyer no well then how you going to find the marks i dont want any marks
they always bury it under a ha nted house or on an island or under a dead tree that got one limb sticking out
well we ve tried jackson island a little and we can try it again some time and there the old ha nted house up the still house branch and there lots of dead limb trees dead loads of em
is it under all of them how you talk no then how you going to know which one to go for
suppose you find a brass pot with a hundred dollars in it all rusty and gray or rotten chest full of di monds
go for all of em why tom_sawyer it ll take all summer well what of that how that huck_finn eyes glowed
that bully plenty bully enough for me just you gimme the hundred dollars and i dont want no di monds
all right but i bet you i aint going to throw off on di monds some of em worth twenty dollars apiece there aint any hardly but worth six bit or a dollar
no is that so cert nly anybody ll tell you so haint you ever seen one huck_finn not as i remember
oh kings have slathers of them well i don know no kings tom_sawyer i reckon you dont but if you was to go to europe you see a raft of em hopping around
do they hop hop your granny no well what did you say they did for shucks i only meant you see em not hopping of course what do they want to hop
for but i mean you just see em scattered around you know in a kind of a general way like that old humpbacked richard
richard what his other name he didnt have any other name kings dont have any but a given name no
well if they like it tom_sawyer all right but i dont want to be a king and have only just a given name like a nigger
but they dont but say where you going to dig first well i dont know pose we tackle that old dead limb tree on the hillt other side of still house branch
they arrived hot and panting and threw themselves down in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke
i agreed so they got a crippled pick and a shovel and set out on their three mile tramp
i like this said tom_sawyer so do i say huck_finn if we find a treasure here what you going to do with your share
well i ll have pie and a glass of soda every day and i ll go to every circus that comes along
i bet i ll have a gay time well aint you going to save any of it save it what for
pap would come back to thish yer town some day and get his claws on it if i didnt hurry up and i tell you he clean it out pretty quick
why so as to have something to live on by and by oh that aint any use what you going to do with yourn tom_sawyer
i going to buy a new drum and a sure nough sword and a red necktie and a bull pup and get married
married that it tom_sawyer you why you aint in your right mind wait you ll see well that the foolishest thing you could do
look at pap and my mother fight why they used to fight all the time i remember mighty well that aint anything
the girl i going to marry wont fight tom_sawyer i reckon they re all alike they ll all comb a body now you better think bout this awhile
i tell you you better what the name of the gal it aint a gal at all it a girl
it all the same i reckon some says gal some says girl both right like enough anyway what her name tom_sawyer
i ll tell you some time not now all right that ll do only if you get married i ll be more lonesomer than ever
no you wont you ll come and live with me now stir out of this and we ll go to digging
they worked and sweated for half an hour no result they toiled another halfhour still no result huck_finn said do they always bury it as deep as this
sometimes not always not generally i reckon we havent got the right place so they chose a new spot and began again
finally huck_finn leaned on his shovel swabbed the beaded drops from his brow with his sleeve and said where you going to dig next after we get this one
the labor dragged a little but still they made progress they pegged away in silence for some time i reckon maybe we ll tackle the old tree that over yonder on cardiff hill back of the widow
i reckon that ll be a good one but wont the widow take it away from us tom_sawyer it on her land
she take it away maybe she like to try it once whoever finds one of these hid treasures it belongs to him
it dont make any difference whose land it on that was satisfactory the work went on by and by huck_finn said blame it we must be in the wrong place again
what do you think it is mighty curious huck_finn i dont understand it sometimes witches interfere i reckon maybe that what the trouble now
shucks witches aint got no power in the daytime well that so i didnt think of that oh i know what the matter is
what a blamed lot of fools we are you got to find out where the shadow of the limb falls at midnight and that where you dig
then consound it we ve fooled away all this work for nothing now hang it all we got to come back in the night
it an awful long way can you get out i bet i will we ve got to do it tonight too because if somebody sees these holes they ll know in a minute
what here and they ll go for it well i ll come around and maow tonight all right let hide the tools in the bushes
the boy were there that night about the appointed time they sat in the shadow waiting it was a lonely place and an hour made solemn by old traditions
spirits whispered in the rustling leaves ghosts lurked in the murky nooks the deep baying of a hound floated up out of the distance an owl answered with his sepulchral note
the boy were subdued by these solemnities and talked little by and by they judged that twelve had come they marked where the shadow fell and began to dig
the hole deepened and still deepened but every time their heart jumped to hear the pick strike upon something they only suffered a new disappointment
their hopes commenced to rise their interest grew stronger and their industry kept pace with it it was only a stone or a chunk
at last tom_sawyer said it aint any use huck_finn we re wrong again well but we cant be wrong we spotted the shadder to a dot
i know it but then there another thing what that why we only guessed at the time like enough it was too late or too early
huck_finn dropped his shovel that it said he that the very trouble we got to give this one up
we cant ever tell the right time and besides this kind of thing too awful here this time of night with witches and ghosts a fluttering around so
i feel as if something behind me all the time and i afeard to turn around becuz maybe there others in front a waiting for a chance
they most always put in a dead man when they bury a treasure under a tree to look out for it
i been creeping all over ever since i got here well i ve been pretty much so too huck_finn lordy yes they do
i ve always heard that tom_sawyer i dont like to fool around much where there dead people a body bound to get into trouble with em sure
i dont like to stir em up either pose this one here was to stick his skull out and say something
dont tom_sawyer it awful well it just is huck_finn i dont feel comfortable a bit say tom_sawyer let give this place up and try somewheres else
all right i reckon we better what ll it be tom_sawyer considered awhile and then said the ha nted house
dead people might talk maybe but they dont come sliding around in a shroud when you aint noticing and peep over your shoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth the way a ghost does
that it blame it i dont like ha nted houses tom_sawyer why they re a dern sight worse dead people i couldnt stand such a thing as that tom_sawyer nobody could
yes but huck_finn ghosts dont travel around only at night they wont hender us from digging there in the daytime
well that so but you know mighty well people dont go about that ha nted house in the day nor the night
well that mostly because they dont like to go where a man been murdered anyway but nothing ever been seen around that house except in the night just some blue lights slipping by the windows no regular ghosts
well where you see one of them blue lights flickering around tom_sawyer you can bet there a ghost mighty close behind it
it stands to reason becuz you know that they dont anybody but ghosts use em
yes that so but anyway they dont come around in the daytime so what the use of our being afeard
well all right we ll tackle the ha nted house if you say so but i reckon it taking chances they had started down the hill by this time
the ha nted house utterly isolated its fences gone long ago rank weeds smothering the very doorsteps the chimney crumbled to ruin the window sashes vacant a corner of the roof caved in
the boy gazed awhile half expecting to see a blue light flit past a window then talking in a low tone as befitted the time and the circumstances they struck far off to the right to give the haunted house a wide berth and took their way homeward through the woods that adorned the rearward side of cardiff hill
there in the middle of the moonlit valley below them stood chapter xvi about noon the next day the boy arrived at the dead tree they had come for their tools
tom_sawyer was impatient to go to the haunted house huck_finn was measurably so also but suddenly said lookyhere tom_sawyer do you know what day it is
tom_sawyer mentally ran over the days of the week and then quickly lifted his eyes with a startled look in them my
i never once thought of it huck_finn well i didnt neither but all at once it popped onto me that it was friday
blame it a body cant be too careful huck_finn we might a got into an awful scrape tackling such a thing on a friday
might better say we would there some lucky days maybe but friday aint any fool knows that
i dont reckon you was the first that found it out huck_finn well i never said i was did i
and friday aint all neither i had a rotten bad dream last night dreampt about rats no sure sign of trouble
did they fight no well that good huck_finn when they dont fight it only a sign that there trouble around you know
all we got to do is to look mighty sharp and keep out of it we ll drop this thing for today and play
do you know robin hood huck_finn no who robin hood why he was one of the greatest men that was ever in england and the best
he was a robber cracky i wisht i was who did he rob only sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings and such like
but he never bothered the poor he loved em he always divided up with em perfectly square well he must a been a brick
i bet you he was huck_finn oh he was the noblest man that ever was they aint any such men now i can tell you
he could lick any man in england with one hand tied behind him and he could take his yew bow and plug a ten cent piece every time a mile and a half
what a yew bow i dont know it some kind of a bow of course and if he hit that dime only on the edge he would set down and cry and curse
so they played robin hood all the afternoon now and then casting a yearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about the morrow prospects and possibilities there
as the sun began to sink into the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows of the trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of cardiff hill
but we ll play robin hood it nobby fun i ll learn you i agreed on saturday shortly after noon the boy were at the dead tree again
they had a smoke and a chat in the shade and then dug a little in their last hole not with great hope but merely because tom_sawyer said there were so many cases where people had given up a treasure after getting down within six inches of it and then somebody else had come along and turned it up with a single thrust of a shovel
the thing failed this time however so the boy shouldered their tools and went away feeling that they had not trifled with fortune but had fulfilled all the requirements that belong to the business of treasure hunting
when they reached the haunted house there was something so weird and grisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sun and something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of the place that they were afraid for a moment to venture in
they saw a weedgrown floorless room unplastered an ancient fireplace vacant windows a ruinous staircase and here there and everywhere hung ragged and abandoned cobwebs
they presently entered softly with quickened pulses talking in whispers ears alert to catch the slightest sound and muscles tense and ready for instant retreat
in a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave the place a critical and interested examination rather admiring their own boldness and wondering at it too
this was something like cutting off retreat but they got to daring each other and of course there could be but one result
then they crept to the door and took a trembling peep next they wanted to look upstairs they threw their tools into a corner and made the ascent
up there were the same signs of decay in one corner they found a closet that promised mystery but the promise was a fraud there was nothing in it
their courage was up now and well in hand they were about to go down and begin work when sh said tom_sawyer
what is it whispered huck_finn blanching with fright sh there hear it yes oh my let run keep still
the boy stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes to knotholes in the planking and lay waiting in a misery of fear
dont you budge they re coming right toward the door they ve stopped no coming here they are dont whisper another word huck_finn
my goodness i wish i was out of this two men entered each boy said to himself there the old deaf and dumb spaniard
that been about town once or twice lately never sawt other man beforet other was a ragged unkempt creature with nothing very pleasant in his face
the spaniard was wrapped in a serape he had bushy white whiskers long white hair flowed from under his sombrero and he wore green goggles
when they came int other was talking in a low voice they sat down on the ground facing the door with their backs to the wall and the speaker continued his remarks
his manner became less guarded and his words more distinct as he proceeded no said he i ve thought it all over and i dont like it
it dangerous dangerous grunted the deaf and dumb spaniard to the vast surprise of the boy milksop this voice made the boy gasp and quake
it was injun joe_harper there was silence for some time then joe_harper said what any more dangerous than that job up yonder but nothing come of it
that different away up the river so and not another house about twont ever be known that we tried anyway long as we didnt succeed
well what more dangerous than coming here in the daytime anybody would suspicion us that saw us i know that
but there warnt any other place as handy after that fool of a job i want to quit this shanty i wanted to yesterday only it warn t
any use trying to stir out of here with those infernal boy playing over there on the hill right in full view
those infernal boy quaked again under the inspiration of this remark and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it was friday and concluded to wait a day
they wished in their heart they had waited a year the two men got out some food and made a luncheon
after a long and thoughtful silence injun joe_harper said look here lad you go back up the river where you belong wait there till you hear from me
i ll take the chances on dropping into this town just once more for a look we ll do that dangerous job after i ve spied around a little and think thing look well for it
then for texas we ll leg it together this was satisfactory both men presently fell to yawning and injun joe_harper said i dead for sleep
it your turn to watch he curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore his comrade stirred him once or twice and he became quiet
presently the watcher began to nod his head drooped lower and lower both men began to snore now the boy drew a long grateful breath
tom_sawyer whispered now our chance come huck_finn said i cant i die if they was to wake tom_sawyer urged huck_finn held back
but the first step he made wrung such a hideous creak from the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright
the boy lay there counting the dragging moments till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternity growing gray and then they were grateful to note that at last the sun was setting
injun joe_harper sat up stared around smiled grimly upon his comrade whose head was drooping upon his knees stirred him up with his foot and said here
at last tom_sawyer rose slowly and softly and started alone he never made a second attempt now one snore ceased you re a watchman aint you
all right though nothing happened my have i been asleep oh partly partly nearly time for us to be moving pard
what ll we do with what little swag we ve got left i dont know leave it here as we ve always done i reckon
no use to take it away till we start south six hundred and fifty in silver something to carry well all right it wont matter to come here once more
no but i say come in the night as we used to do it better yes but look here it may be a good while
before i get the right chance at that job accidents might happen taint in such a very good place we ll just regularly bury it and bury it deep
good idea said the comrade who walked across the room knelt down raised one of the rearward hearth stones and took out a bag that jingled pleasantly
he subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars for himself and as much for injun joe_harper and passed the bag to the latter who was on his knees in the corner now digging with his bowie knife
the boy forgot all their fears all their miseries in an instant with gloating eyes they watched every movement luck the splendor of it was beyond all imagination
six hundred dollars was money enough to make half a dozen boy rich here was treasure hunting under the happiest auspices there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as to where to dig
they nudged each other every moment eloquent nudges and easily understood for they simply meant oh but aint you glad now we re here
joe_harper knife struck upon something hello said he what is it said his comrade half rotten plank no it a box i believe
here bear a hand and we ll see what it here for never mind i ve broke a hole he reached his hand in and drew it
out man it money the two men examined the handful of coins they were gold the boy above were as excited as themselves and as delighted
there an old rusty pick over amongst the weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace i saw it a minute ago
injun joe_harper took the pick looked it over critically shook his head muttered something to himself and then began to use it
joe_harper comrade said we ll make quick work of this he ran and brought the boy pick and shovel the box was soon unearthed
it was not very large it was iron bound and had been very strong before the slow years had injured it
the men contemplated the treasure awhile in blissful silence pard there thousands of dollars here said injun joe_harper twas always said that murrel gang used to be around here one summer the stranger observed
i know it said injun joe_harper and this looks like it i should say now you wont need to do that job
the halfbreed frowned said he you dont know me least you dont know all about that thing taint robbery altogether
it revenge and a wicked light flamed in his eyes i ll need your help in it when it finished then texas
go home to your nance and your kids and stand by till you hear from me well if you say so what ll we do with this bury it again
yes ravishing delight overhead no by the great sachem no profound distress overhead i nearly forgot that pick had fresh earth on it
the boy were sick with terror in a moment what business has a pick and a shovel here what business with fresh earth on them
who brought them here and where are they gone have you heard anybody seen anybody what bury it again and leave them to come and see the ground disturbed
not exactly not exactly we ll take it to my den why of course might have thought of that before you mean number one
no number two under the cross the other place is bad too common all right it nearly dark enough to start injun joe_harper got up and went about from window to window cautiously peeping out
presently he said who could have brought those tools here do you reckon they can be upstairs the boy breath forsook them
injun joe_harper put his hand on his knife halted a moment undecided and then turned toward the stairway the boy thought of the closet but their strength was gone
the steps came creaking up the stairs the intolerable distress of the situation woke the stricken resolution of the lads they were about to spring for the closet when there was a crash of rotten timbers and injun joe_harper landed on the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway
he gathered himself up cursing and his comrade said now what the use of all that if it anybody and they re up there let them stay there who cares
if they want to jump down now and get into trouble who objects it will be dark in fifteen minute and then let them follow us if they want to
in my opinion whoever hove those thing in here caught a sight of us and took us for ghosts or devils or something
joe_harper grumbled awhile then he agreed with his friend that what daylight was left ought to be economized in getting thing ready for leaving
shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepening twilight and moved toward the river with their precious box
tom_sawyer and huck_finn rose up weak but vastly relieved and stared after them through the chinks between the logs of the house
i willing i ll bet they re running yet follow not they they were content to reach ground again without broken necks and take the townward track over the hill
they were too much absorbed in hating themselves hating the ill luck that made them take the spade and the pick there
he would have hidden the silver with the gold to wait there till his revenge was satisfied and then he would have had the misfortune to find that money turn up missing
they did not talk much but for that injun joe_harper never would have suspected bitter bitter luck that the tools were ever brought there
they resolved to keep a lookout for that spaniard when he should come to town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job and follow him to number two wherever that might be
then a ghastly thought occurred to tom_sawyer revenge what if he means us huck_finn oh dont said huck_finn nearly fainting
they talked it all over and as they entered town they agreed to believe that he might possibly mean somebody else at least that he might at least mean nobody but
tom_sawyer since only tom_sawyer had testified very very small comfort it was to tom_sawyer to be alone in danger company would be a palpable improvement he thought
four time he had his hands on that rich treasure and four time it wasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him and wakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune
as he lay in the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure he noticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away somewhat as if they had happened in another world or in a time long gone by
chapter xxvii the adventure of the day mightily tormented tom_sawyer dreams that night then it occurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream
there was one very strong argument in favor of this idea namely that the quantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real
he had never seen as much as fifty dollars in one mass before and he was like all boy of his age and station in life in that he imagined that all references to hundreds and thousands were mere fanciful forms of speech and that no such sums really existed in the world
he never had supposed for a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be found in actual money in any one possession
if his notions of hidden treasure had been analyzed they would have been found to consist of a handful of real dimes and a bushel of vague splendid ungraspable dollars
but the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearer under the attrition of thinking them over and so he presently found himself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been a dream after all
this uncertainty must be swept away he would snatch a hurried breakfast and go and find huck_finn huck_finn was sitting on the gunwale of a flatboat listlessly dangling his feet in the water and looking very melancholy
tom_sawyer concluded to let huck_finn lead up to the subject if he did not do it then the adventure would be proved to have been only a dream
hello huck_finn hello yourself silence for a minute tom_sawyer if we a left the blame tools at the dead tree we a got the money
oh aint it awful taint a dream then taint a dream somehow i most wish it was dog if i dont huck_finn
what aint a dream oh that thing yesterday i been half thinking it was dream if them stairs hadnt broke down you
a seen how much dream it was i ve had dreams enough all night with that patch eyed spanish devil going for me all through em rot him
no not rot him find him track the money tom_sawyer we ll never find him a feller dont have only one chance for such a pile and that one lost
i feel mighty shaky if i was to see him anyway well so i but i like to see him anyway and track him out to his number two
number two yes that it i been thinking bout that but i cant make nothing out of it what do you reckon it is
i dono it too deep say huck_finn maybe it the number of a house goody no tom_sawyer that aint it if it is it aint in this one horse town
they aint no numbers here well that so lemme think a minute here it the number of a room in a tavern you know
oh that the trick they aint only two taverns we can find out quick you stay here huck_finn till i come
tom_sawyer was off at once he did not care to have huck_finn company in public places he was gone half an hour
he found that in the best tavern no had long been occupied by a young lawyer and was still so occupied
the tavern keeper young son said it was kept locked all the time and he never saw anybody go into it or come out of it except at night he did not know any particular reason for this state of thing had had some little curiosity but it was rather feeble had made the most of the mystery by entertaining himself with the idea that that room was ha nted had noticed that there was a light in there the night before
in the less ostentatious house no was a mystery that what i ve found out huck_finn i reckon that the very no
we re after i reckon it is tom_sawyer now what you going to do lemme think tom_sawyer thought a long time
the back door of that no is the door that comes out into that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trap of a brick store
now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can find and i ll nip all of auntie and the first dark night we ll go there and try em
and mind you keep a lookout for injun joe_harper because he said he was going to drop into town and spy around once more for a chance to get his revenge
then he said i ll tell you if you see him you just follow him and if he dont go to that
no that aint the place lordy i dont want to foller him by myself why it ll be night sure he mightnt ever see you and if he did maybe he never think anything
well if it pretty dark i reckon i ll track him i dono i dono i ll try you bet i ll follow him if it dark huck_finn
why he might a found out he couldnt get his revenge and be going right after that money it so tom_sawyer it so
i ll foller him i will by jingoes now you re talking dont you ever weaken huck_finn and i wont chapter xxviii that night
they hung about the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine one watching the alley at a distance and the other the tavern door
tom_sawyer and huck_finn were ready for their adventure nobody entered the alley or left it nobody resembling the spaniard entered or left the tavern door
the night promised to be a fair one so tom_sawyer went home with the understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came on huck_finn was to come and maow whereupon he would slip out and try the keys
but the night remained clear and huck_finn closed his watch and retired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve
tuesday the boy had the same ill luck also wednesday but thursday night promised better tom_sawyer slipped out in good season with his aunt old tin lantern and a large towel to blindfold it with
he hid the lantern in huck_finn sugar hogshead and the watch began an hour before midnight the tavern closed up and its lights the only ones thereabouts were put out
no spaniard had been seen nobody had entered or left the alley everything was auspicious the blackness of darkness reigned the perfect stillness was interrupted only by occasional mutterings of distant thunder
tom_sawyer got his lantern lit it in the hogshead wrapped it closely in the towel and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern
huck_finn stood sentry and tom_sawyer felt his way into the alley then there was a season of waiting anxiety that weighed upon huck_finn spirits like a mountain
he began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern it would frighten him but it would at least tell him that tom_sawyer was alive yet
it seemed hours since tom_sawyer had disappeared surely he must have fainted maybe he was dead maybe his heart had burst under terror and excitement
in his uneasiness huck_finn found himself drawing closer and closer to the alley fearing all sorts of dreadful thing and momentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take away his breath
there was not much to take away for he seemed only able to inhale it by thimblefuls and his heart would soon wear itself out the way it was beating
suddenly there was a flash of light and tom_sawyer came tearing by him run said he run for your life
he neednt have repeated it once was enough huck_finn was making thirty or forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered
the boy never stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughter house at the lower end of the village
just as they got within its shelter the storm burst and the rain poured down as soon as tom_sawyer got his breath he said huck_finn it was awful
i tried two of the keys just as soft as i could but they seemed to make such a power of racket that i couldnt hardly get my breath
i was so scared they wouldnt turn in the lock either well without noticing what i was doing i took hold of the knob and open comes the door
it warnt locked i hopped in and shook off the towel and great caesar ghost what what you see tom_sawyer
he was lying there sound asleep on the floor with his old patch on his eye and his arms spread out
huck_finn i most stepped onto injun joe_harper hand no yes lordy what did you do did he wake up
no never budged drunk i reckon i just grabbed that towel and started i never a thought of the towel i bet
well i would my aunt would make me mighty sick if i lost it say tom_sawyer did you see that box
i didnt see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on the floor by injun joe_harper yes i saw two barrels and lots more bottles in the room
huck_finn i didnt wait to look around i didnt see the box i didnt see the cross dont you see now what the matter with that
ha nted room how why it ha nted with whiskey maybe all the temperance taverns have got a ha nted room hey huck_finn
well i reckon maybe that so who a thought such a thing but say tom_sawyer now a mighty good time to get that box if injun joe_harper drunk
it is that you try it huck_finn shuddered well no i reckon not and i reckon not huck_finn only one bottle alongside of injun joe_harper aint enough
there was a long pause for reflection and then tom_sawyer said lookyhere huck_finn less not try that thing any more till we know
if there been three he be drunk enough and i do it injun joe_harper not in there it too scary
now if we watch every night we ll be dead sure to see him go out some time or other and then we ll snatch that box quicker lightning
i ll watch the whole night long and i ll do it every night too if you ll do the other part of the job
all you got to do is to trot up hooper street a block and maow and if i asleep you throw some gravel at the window and that ll fetch me
well i agreed all right i will agreed and good as wheat now huck_finn the storm over and i ll go home
it ll begin to be daylight in a couple of hours you go back and watch that long will you i said i would tom_sawyer and
i will i ll ha nt that tavern every night for a year i ll sleep all day and i ll stand watch all night
that all right now where you going to sleep in ben_rogers hayloft he lets me and so does his pap nigger man uncle jake

but you neednt tell that a body got to do thing when he awful hungry he wouldnt want to do as a steady thing
well if i dont want you in the daytime i ll let you sleep i wont come bothering around any time you see something up in the night just skip right around and maow
chapter xxix the first thing tom_sawyer heard on friday morning was a glad piece of news judge becky_thatcher family had come back to town the night before
both injun joe_harper and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a moment and becky_thatcher took the chief place in the boy interest
he saw her and they had an exhausting good time playing hispy and gully keeper with a crowd of their schoolmates
the day was completed and crowned in a peculiarly satisfactory way becky_thatcher teased her mother to appoint the next day for the long promised and long delayed picnic and she consented
the invitations were sent out before sunset and straightway the young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparation and pleasurable anticipation
tom_sawyer excitement enabled him to keep awake until a pretty late hour and he had good hopes of hearing huck_finn maow and of having his treasure to astonish becky_thatcher and the picnickers with next day but he was disappointed
morning came eventually and by ten or eleven clock a giddy and rollicking company were gathered at judge becky_thatcher and everything was ready for a start
the child delight was boundless and tom_sawyer not more moderate no signal came that night it was not the custom for elderly people to mar the picnics with their presence
the children were considered safe enough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a few young gentlemen of twenty three or thereabouts
the old steam ferry boat was chartered for the occasion presently the gay throng filed up the main street laden with provision baskets
sid was sick and had to miss the fun mary remained at home to entertain him the last thing mrs becky_thatcher said to becky_thatcher was you ll not get back till late
perhaps you better stay all night with some of the girl that live near the ferry landing child then i ll stay with susy joe_harper mamma
very well and mind and behave yourself and dont be any trouble presently as they tripped along tom_sawyer said to becky_thatcher say i ll tell you what we ll do
stead of going to joe_harper we ll climb right up the hill and stop at the widow douglas she ll have ice cream
she has it most every day dead loads of it and she ll be awful glad to have us oh that will be fun
then becky_thatcher reflected a moment and said but what will mamma say how ll she ever know the girl turned the idea over in her mind and said reluctantly i reckon it wrong but
all she wants is that you ll be safe and i bet you she a said go there if she a thought of it
but shucks your mother wont know and so what the harm i know she would the widow douglas splendid hospitality was a tempting bait
it and tom_sawyer persuasions presently carried the day so it was decided to say nothing to anybody about the night programme
presently it occurred to tom_sawyer that maybe huck_finn might come this very night and give the signal the thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations
he reasoned the signal did not come the night before so why should it be any more likely to come tonight
the sure fun of the evening outweighed the uncertain treasure and boy like he determined to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of the box of money another time that day
still he could not bear to give up the fun at widow douglas and why should he give it up three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody hollow and tied up
all the different way of getting hot and tired were gone through with and by and by the rovers straggled back to camp fortified with responsible appetites and then the destruction of the good thing began
the crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest distances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings and laughter after the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chat in the shade of spreading oaks
by and by somebody shouted who ready for the cave everybody was bundles of candles were procured and straightway there was a general scamper up the hill
the mouth of the cave was up the hillside an opening shaped like a letter a its massive oaken door stood unbarred
within was a small chamber chilly as an icehouse and walled by nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat
it was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and look out upon the green valley shining in the sun
the moment a candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it a struggle and a gallant defence followed but the candle was soon knocked down or blown out and then there was a glad clamor of laughter and a new chase
by and by the procession went filing down the steep descent of the main avenue the flickering rank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to their point of junction sixty feet overhead
but the impressiveness of the situation quickly wore off and the romping began again but all thing have an end this main avenue was not more than eight or ten feet wide
mcdougal cave was but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other and out again and led nowhere
it was said that one might wander days and nights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms and never find the end of the cave and that he might go down and down and still down into the earth and it was just the same labyrinth under labyrinth and no end to any of them
every few steps other lofty and still narrower crevices branched from it on either hand for no man knew the cave that was an impossible thing
most of the young men knew a portion of it and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion
the procession moved along the main avenue some three quarters of a mile and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branch avenues fly along the dismal corridors and take each other by surprise at points where the corridors joined again
tom_sawyer knew as much of the cave as any one parties were able to elude each other for the space of half an hour without going beyond the known ground
by and by one group after another came straggling back to the mouth of the cave panting hilarious smeared from head to foot with tallow drippings daubed with clay and entirely delighted with the success of the day
then they were astonished to find that they had been taking no note of time and that night was about at hand
the clanging bell had been calling for half an hour however this sort of close to the day adventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory
when the ferryboat with her wild freight pushed into the stream nobody cared sixpence for the wasted time but the captain of the craft
he heard no noise on board for the young people were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearly tired to death
he wondered what boat it was and why she did not stop at the wharf and then he dropped her out of his mind and put his attention upon his business
huck_finn was already upon his watch when the ferryboat lights went glinting past the wharf the night was growing cloudy and dark
ten clock came and the noise of vehicles ceased scattered lights began to wink out all straggling foot passengers disappeared the village betook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with the silence and the ghosts
eleven clock came and the tavern lights were put out darkness everywhere now huck_finn waited what seemed a weary long time but nothing happened
his faith was weakening was there any use was there really any use why not give it up and turn in
a noise fell upon his ear he was all attention in an instant the alley door closed softly he sprang to the corner of the brick store
the next moment two men brushed by him and one seemed to have something under his arm it must be that box
so they were going to remove the treasure why call tom_sawyer now it would be absurd the men would get away with the box and never be found again
so communing with himself huck_finn stepped out and glided along behind the men cat like with bare feet allowing them to keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible
no he would stick to their wake and follow them he would trust to the darkness for security from discovery they moved up the river street three blocks then turned to the left up a crossstreet
they went straight ahead then until they came to the path that led up cardiff hill this they took they passed by the old welshman house halfway up the hill without hesitating and still climbed upward
good thought huck_finn they will bury it in the old quarry but they never stopped at the quarry they passed on up the summit
they plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumach bushes and were at once hidden in the gloom huck_finn closed up and shortened his distance now for they would never be able to see him
he trotted along awhile then slackened his pace fearing he was gaining too fast moved on a piece then stopped altogether listened no sound none save that he seemed to hear the beating of his own heart
the hooting of an owl came over the hill ominous sound but no footsteps heavens was everything lost he was about to spring with winged feet when a man cleared his throat not four feet from him
huck_finn heart shot into his throat but he swallowed it again and then he stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground
he knew where he was he knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into widow douglas grounds very well he thought let them bury it there it wont be hard to find
now there was a voice a very low voice injun joe_harper damn her maybe she got company there lights late as it is
i cant see any this was that stranger voice the stranger of the haunted house a deadly chill went to huck_finn heart this then was the revenge job
then he remembered that the widow douglas had been kind to him more than once and maybe these men were going to murder her
his thought was to fly he wished he dared venture to warn her but he knew he didnt dare they might come and catch him
he thought all this and more in the moment that elapsed between the stranger remark and injun joe_harper next which was because the bush is in your way
now this way now you see dont you yes well there is company there i reckon better give it up give it up and i just leaving this country forever
give it up and maybe never have another chance i tell you again as i ve told you before i dont care for her swag you may have it
but her husband was rough on me many time he was rough on me and mainly he was the justice of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant
and that aint all it aint a millionth part of it he had me horsewhipped horsewhipped in front of the jail like a nigger with all the town looking on
horsewhipped do you understand he took advantage of me and died but i ll take it out of her oh dont kill her
dont do that kill who said anything about killing i would kill him if he was here but not her when you want to get revenge on a woman you dont kill her bosh
you go for her looks you slit her nostrils you notch her ears like a sow by god that keep your opinion to yourself
it will be safest for you i ll tie her to the bed if she bleeds to death is that my fault
i ll not cry if she does my friend you ll help me in this thing for my sake that why you re here i mightnt be able alone
if you flinch i ll kill you do you understand that and if i have to kill you i ll kill her and then i reckon
nobody ll ever know much about who done this business well if it got to be done let get at it
the quicker the better i all in a shiver do it now and company there look here i ll get suspicious of you first thing you know
huck_finn felt that a silence was going to ensue a thing still more awful than any amount of murderous talk so he held his breath and stepped gingerly back planted his foot carefully and firmly after balancing one legged in a precarious way and almost toppling over first on one side and then on the other
he took another step back with the same elaboration and the same risks then another and another and a twig snapped under his foot
no we ll wait till the lights are out there no hurry his breath stopped and he listened there was no sound the stillness was perfect
now he turned in his tracks between the walls of sumach bushes turned himself as carefully as if he were a ship and then stepped quickly but cautiously along
his gratitude was measureless when he emerged at the quarry he felt secure and so he picked up his nimble heels and flew
he banged at the door and presently the heads of the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows
down down he sped till he reached the welshman what the row there who banging what do you want let me in quick
i ll tell everything why who are you huckleberry_finn quick let me in huckleberry_finn indeed it aint a name to open many doors i judge
but let him in lads and let see what the trouble please dont ever tell i told you were huck_finn first words when he got in
i be killed sure but the widow been good friends to me sometimes and i want to tell i will tell if you ll promise you wont ever say it was me
please dont by george he has got something to tell or he wouldnt act so exclaimed the old man out with it and nobody here ll ever tell lad
three minute later the old man and his sons well armed were up the hill and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe their weapons in their hands
there was a lagging anxious silence and then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry
huck_finn accompanied them no further he hid behind a great bowlder and fell to listening huck_finn waited for no particulars
chapter xxx as the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on sunday morning huck_finn came groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old welshman door
the inmates were asleep but it was a sleep that was set on a hair trigger on account of the exciting episode of the night
he sprang away and sped down the hill as fast as his legs could carry him a call came from a window who there
huck_finn scared voice answered in a low tone please let me in it only huck_finn it a name that can open this door night or day lad and welcome
these were strange words to the vagabond boy ears and the pleasantest he had ever heard he could not recollect that the closing word had ever been applied in his case before
the door was quickly unlocked and he entered huck_finn was given a seat and the old man and his brace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves
now my boy i hope you re good and hungry because breakfast will be ready as soon as the sun up and we ll have a piping hot one too
make yourself easy about that i and the boy hoped you turn up and stop here last night i was awful scared said huck_finn and i run
i took out when the pistols went off and i didnt stop for three mile i ve come now becuz i wanted to know about it you know and i come before daylight becuz
well poor chap you do look as if you had a hard night of it but there a bed here for you when you ve had your breakfast
i didnt want to run across them devils even if they was dead no they aint dead lad we are sorry enough for that
you see we knew right where to put our hands on them by your description so we crept along on tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them
dark as a cellar that sumach path was and just then i found i was going to sneeze it was the meanest kind of luck
i was in the lead with my pistol raised and when the sneeze started those scoundrels a rustling to get out of the path i sung out fire boy
i tried to keep it back but no use twas bound to come and it did come and blazed away at the place where the rustling was
so did the boy but they were off in a jiffy those villains and we after them down through the woods
i judge we never touched them they fired a shot apiece as they started but their bullets whizzed by and didnt do us any harm
as soon as we lost the sound of their feet we quit chasing and went down and stirred up the constables
they got a posse together and went off to guard the river bank and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going to beat up the woods
my boy will be with them presently i wish we had some sort of description of those rascals twould help a good deal
but you couldnt see what they were like in the dark lad i suppose oh yes i saw them downtown and follered them
splendid describe them describe them my boy one the old deaf and dumb spaniard that ben_rogers around here once or twice andt other a mean looking ragged
that enough lad we know the men happened on them in the woods back of the widow one day and they slunk away
as they were leaving the room huck_finn sprang up and exclaimed oh please dont tell any body it was me that blowed on them
off with you boy and tell the sheriff get your breakfast tomorrow morning the welshman sons departed at once oh please
all right if you say it huck_finn but you ought to have the credit of what you did oh no no
please dont tell when the young men were gone the old welshman said they wont tell and i wont but why dont you want it known
huck_finn would not explain further than to say that he already knew too much about one of those men and would not have the man know that he knew anything against him for the whole world he would be killed for knowing it sure
the old man promised secrecy once more and said how did you come to follow these fellows lad were they looking suspicious
then he said well you see i a kind of a hard lot least everybody says so and i dont see nothing agin it
and sometimes i cant sleep much on account of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new way of doing
i couldnt sleep and so i come along upstreet bout midnight a turning it all over and when i got to that old shackly brick store by the temperance tavern i backed up agin the wall to have another think
well just then along comes these two chaps slipping along close by me with something under their arm and i reckoned they stole it
one was a smoking andt other one wanted a light so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit up their faces
and i see that the big one was the deaf and dumb spaniard by his white whiskers and the patch on his eye andt other one was a rusty ragged looking devil
huck_finn was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply that was the way of it last night could you see the rags by the light of the cigars
this staggered huck_finn for a moment then he said well i dont know but somehow it seems as if i did
then they went on and you follered em yes that was it i wanted to see what was up they sneaked along so
i dogged em to the widder stile and stood in the dark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder and the spaniard swear he spile her
looks just as i told you and your two what the deaf and dumb man said all that huck_finn had made another terrible mistake
he was trying his best to keep the old man from getting the faintest hint of who the spaniard might be and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble in spite of all he could do
he made several efforts to creep out of his scrape but the old man eye was upon him and he made blunder after blunder
presently the welshman said my boy dont be afraid of me i wouldnt hurt a hair of your head for all the world
no i protect you i protect you this spaniard is not deaf and dumb you ve let that slip without intending it you cant cover that up now
you know something about that spaniard that you want to keep dark now trust me tell me what it is and trust me
huck_finn looked into the old man honest eyes a moment then bent over and whispered in his ear taint a spaniard
i wont betray you it injun joe_harper the welshman almost jumped out of his chair in a moment he said it all plain enough now
when you talked about notching ears and slitting noses i judged that that was your own embellishment because white men dont take that sort of revenge
during breakfast the talk went on and in the course of it the old man said that the last thing which he and his sons had done before going to bed was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity for marks of blood
but an injun that a different matter altogether they found none but captured a bulky bundle of of what
if the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a more stunning suddenness from huck_finn blanched lips
his eyes were staring wide now and his breath suspended waiting for the answer the welshman started stared in return three seconds five seconds ten then replied of burglar tools
why what the matter with you huck_finn sank back panting gently but deeply unutterably grateful the welshman eyed him gravely curiously and presently said yes burglar tools
that appears to relieve you a good deal but what did give you that turn what were you expecting we found
huck_finn was in a close place the inquiring eye was upon him he would have given anything for material for a plausible answer nothing suggested itself the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper a senseless reply offered there was no time to weigh it so at a venture he uttered it feebly sunday school books maybe
poor huck_finn was too distressed to smile but the old man laughed loud and joyously shook up the details of his anatomy from head to foot and ended by saying that such a laugh was money in a man pocket because it cut down the doctor bill like everything
then he added poor old chap you re white and jaded you aint well a bit no wonder you re a little flighty and off your balance
huck_finn was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed such a suspicious excitement for he had dropped the idea that the parcel brought from the tavern was the treasure as soon as he had heard the talk at the widow stile
but you ll come out of it rest and sleep will fetch you out all right i hope he had only thought it was not the treasure however he had not known that
but on the whole he felt glad the little episode had happened for now he knew beyond all question that that bundle was not the bundle and so his mind was at rest and exceedingly comfortable
in fact everything seemed to be drifting just in the right direction now the treasure must be still in no the men would be captured and jailed that day and he and tom_sawyer could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of interruption
it wasnt and so the suggestion of a captured bundle was too much for his self possession just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door
the welshman admitted several ladies and gentlemen among them the widow douglas and noticed that groups of citizens were climbing up the hill to stare at the stile
huck_finn jumped for a hiding place for he had no mind to be connected even remotely with the late event so the news had spread
the welshman had to tell the story of the night to the visitors the widow gratitude for her preservation was outspoken
there another that you re more beholden to than you are to me and my boy maybe but he dont allow me to tell his name
of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittled the main matter but the welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals of his visitors and through them be transmitted to the whole town for he refused to part with his secret
when all else had been learned the widow said i went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all that noise
dont say a word about it madam we wouldnt have been there but for him why didnt you come and wake me
those fellows warnt likely to come again they hadnt any tools left to work with and what was the use of waking you up and scaring you to death
we judged it warnt worth while my three negro men stood guard at your house all the rest of the night
they ve just come back more visitors came and the story had to be told and retold for a couple of hours more
there was no sabbath school during day school vacation but everybody was early at church the stirring event was well canvassed news came that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered
when the sermon was finished judge becky_thatcher wife dropped alongside of mrs joe_harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said is my becky_thatcher going to sleep all day
i just expected she would be tired to death your becky_thatcher yes with a startled look didnt she stay with you last night
why no mrs becky_thatcher turned pale and sank into a pew just as aunt_polly talking briskly with a friend passed by
aunt_polly said goodmorning mrs becky_thatcher goodmorning mrs joe_harper i ve got a boy that turned up missing i reckon my tom_sawyer stayed at your house last night one of you
and now he afraid to come to church i ve got to settle with him mrs becky_thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever
he didnt stay with us said mrs joe_harper beginning to look uneasy a marked anxiety came into aunt_polly face
joe_harper have you seen my tom_sawyer this morning no when did you see him last joe_harper tried to remember but was not sure he could say
the people had stopped moving out of church whispers passed along and a boding uneasiness took possession of every countenance children were anxiously questioned and young teachers
they all said they had not noticed whether tom_sawyer and becky_thatcher were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip it was dark
no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing one young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave
the alarm swept from lip to lip from group to group from street to street and within five minute the bells were wildly clanging and the whole town was up
the cardiff hill episode sank into instant insignificance the burglars were forgotten horses were saddled skiffs were manned the ferryboat ordered out and before the horror was half an hour old two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward the cave
mrs becky_thatcher swooned away aunt_polly fell to crying and wringing her hands all the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead
many women visited aunt_polly and mrs becky_thatcher and tried to comfort them they cried with them too and that was still better than words
all the tedious night the town waited for news but when the morning dawned at last all the word that came was send more candles and send food
mrs becky_thatcher was almost crazed and aunt_polly also judge becky_thatcher sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave but they conveyed no real cheer
the old welshman came home toward daylight spattered with candle grease smeared with clay and almost worn out he found huck_finn still in the bed that had been provided for him and delirious with fever
she said she would do her best by him because whether he was good bad or indifferent he was the lord and nothing that was the lord was a thing to be neglected
the physicians were all at the cave so the widow douglas came and took charge of the patient the welshman said huck_finn had good spots in him and the widow said you can depend on it
that the lord mark he dont leave it off he never does puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his hands
early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into the village but the strongest of the citizens continued searching
all the news that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern were being ransacked that had never been visited before that every corner and crevice was going to be thoroughly searched that wherever one wandered through the maze of passages lights were to be seen flitting hither and thither in the distance and shoutings and pistol shots sent their hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles
in one place far from the section usually traversed by tourists the names becky_thatcher tom_sawyer had been found traced upon the rocky wall with candle smoke and near at hand a grease soiled bit of ribbon
she said it was the last relic she should ever have of her child and that no other memorial of her could ever be so precious because this one parted latest from the living body before the awful death came
some said that now and then in the cave a far away speck of light would glimmer and then a glorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down the echoing aisle and then a sickening disappointment always followed the children were not there it was only a searcher light
mrs becky_thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along and the village sank into a hopeless stupor
the accidental discovery just made that the proprietor of the temperance tavern kept liquor on his premises scarcely fluttered the public pulse tremendous as the fact was
in a lucid interval huck_finn feebly led up to the subject of taverns and finally asked dimly dreading the worst if anything had been discovered at the temperance tavern since he had been ill
no one had heart for anything yes said the widow huck_finn started up in bed wildeyed what what was it
liquor and the place has been shut up lie down child what a turn you did give me only tell me just one thing only just one please
was it tom_sawyer that found it the widow burst into tears hush hush child hush i ve told you before you must not talk
you are very very sick then nothing but liquor had been found there would have been a great powwow if it had been the gold
so the treasure was gone forever gone forever but what could she be crying about curious that she should cry these thoughts worked their dim way through huck_finn mind and under the weariness they gave him he fell asleep
the widow said to herself there he asleep poor wreck tom_sawyer find it pity but somebody could find tom_sawyer ah there aint many left now that got hope enough or strength enough either to go on searching
they tripped along the murky aisles with the rest of the company visiting the familiar wonders of the cave wonders dubbed with rather over descriptive names such as the drawing room the cathedral aladdin palace and so on
presently the hide and seek frolicking began and tom_sawyer and becky_thatcher engaged in it with zeal until the exertion began to grow a trifle wearisome then they wandered down a sinuous avenue holding their candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork of names dates postoffice addresses and mottoes with which the rocky walls had been frescoed in candle smoke
still drifting along and talking they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cave whose walls were not frescoed
chapter xxxi now to return to tom_sawyer and becky_thatcher share in the picnic they smoked their own names under an overhanging shelf and moved on
presently they came to a place where a little stream of water trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestone sediment with it had in the slow dragging ages formed a laced and ruffled niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone
he found that it curtained a sort of steep natural stairway which was enclosed between narrow walls and at once the ambition to be a discoverer seized him
tom_sawyer squeezed his small body behind it in order to illuminate it for becky_thatcher gratification becky_thatcher responded to his call and they made a smoke mark for future guidance and started upon their quest
they wound this way and that far down into the secret depths of the cave made another mark and branched off in search of novelties to tell the upper world about
in one place they found a spacious cavern from whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of the length and circumference of a man leg they walked all about it wondering and admiring and presently left it by one of the numerous passages that opened into it
this shortly brought them to a bewitching spring whose basin was incrusted with a frostwork of glittering crystals it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls were supported by many fantastic pillars which had been formed by the joining of great stalactites and stalagmites together the result of the ceaseless water drip of centuries
under the roof vast knots of bats had packed themselves together thousands in a bunch the lights disturbed the creatures and they came flocking down by hundreds squeaking and darting furiously at the candles
he seized becky_thatcher hand and hurried her into the first corridor that offered and none too soon for a bat struck becky_thatcher light out with its wing while she was passing out of the cavern
the bats chased the children a good distance but the fugitives plunged into every new passage that offered and at last got rid of the perilous thing
tom_sawyer knew their way and the danger of this sort of conduct tom_sawyer found a subterranean lake shortly which stretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows
now for the first time the deep stillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of the children
he wanted to explore its borders but concluded that it would be best to sit down and rest awhile first becky_thatcher said why i didnt notice but it seems ever so long since i heard any of the others
come to think becky_thatcher we are away down below them and i dont know how far away north or south or east or whichever it is
we couldnt hear them here becky_thatcher grew apprehensive i wonder how long we ve been down here tom_sawyer we better start back
yes i reckon we better raps we better can you find the way tom_sawyer it all a mixed up crookedness to me
i reckon i could find it but then the bats if they put our candles out it will be an awful fix
let try some other way so as not to go through there well but i hope we wont get lost
they started through a corridor and traversed it in silence a long way glancing at each new opening to see if there was anything familiar about the look of it but they were all strange
every time tom_sawyer made an examination becky_thatcher would watch his face for an encouraging sign and he would say cheerily oh it all right
it would be so awful and the girl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities this aint the one but we ll come to it right away
but he felt less and less hopeful with each failure and presently began to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random in desperate hope of finding the one that was wanted
he still said it was all right but there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the words had lost their ring and sounded just as if he had said all is lost
becky_thatcher clung to his side in an anguish of fear and tried hard to keep back the tears but they would come
at last she said oh tom_sawyer never mind the bats let go back that way we seem to get worse and worse off all the time
the call went echoing down the empty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound that resembled a ripple of mocking laughter
listen said he profound silence silence so deep that even their breathings were conspicuous in the hush tom_sawyer shouted oh dont do it again tom_sawyer it is too horrid said becky_thatcher
it is horrid but i better becky_thatcher they might hear us you know and he shouted again the might was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter it so confessed a perishing hope
the children stood still and listened but there was no result tom_sawyer turned upon the back track at once and hurried his steps
it was but a little while before a certain indecision in his manner revealed another fearful fact to becky_thatcher he could not find his way back
oh tom_sawyer you didnt make any marks becky_thatcher i was such a fool such a fool i never thought we might want to come back
no i cant find the way it all mixed up tom_sawyer tom we re lost we re lost we never can get out of this awful place
she sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that tom_sawyer was appalled with the idea that she might die or lose her reason
he sat down by her and put his arms around her she buried her face in his bosom she clung to him she poured out her terrors her unavailing regrets and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter
oh why did we ever leave the others tom_sawyer begged her to pluck up hope again and she said she could not
she said she would try to hope again she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only he would not talk like that any more
he fell to blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserable situation this had a better effect for he was no more to blame than she she said
for a little while hope made a show of reviving not with any reason to back it but only because it is its nature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by age and familiarity with failure
so they moved on again aimlessly simply at random all they could do was to move keep moving by and by tom_sawyer took becky_thatcher candle and blew it out
this economy meant so much words were not needed becky_thatcher understood and her hope died again she knew that tom_sawyer had a whole candle and three or four pieces in his pockets yet he must economize
by and by fatigue began to assert its claims the children tried to pay attention for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when time was grown to be so precious moving in some direction in any direction was at least progress and might bear fruit but to sit down was to invite death and shorten its pursuit
tom_sawyer rested with her and they talked of home and the friends there and the comfortable beds and above all the light
becky_thatcher cried and tom_sawyer tried to think of some way of comforting her but all his encouragements were grown thread bare with use and sounded like sarcasms
at last becky_thatcher frail limbs refused to carry her farther she sat down fatigue bore so heavily upon becky_thatcher that she drowsed off to sleep
he sat looking into her drawn face and saw it grow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams and by and by a smile dawned and rested there
the peaceful face reflected somewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit and his thoughts wandered away to bygone time and dreamy memory
while he was deep in his musings becky_thatcher woke up with a breezy little laugh but it was stricken dead upon her lips and a groan followed it
tom_sawyer was grateful oh how could i sleep i wish i never never had waked no no i dont tom_sawyer
dont look so i wont say it again i glad you ve slept becky_thatcher you ll feel rested now and we ll find the way out
we can try tom_sawyer but i ve seen such a beautiful country in my dream i reckon we are going there
maybe not maybe not cheer up becky_thatcher and let go on trying they rose up and wandered along hand in hand and hopeless
they tried to estimate how long they had been in the cave but all they knew was that it seemed days and weeks and yet it was plain that this could not be for their candles were not gone yet
a long time after this they could not tell how long tom_sawyer said they must go softly and listen for dripping water they must find a spring
they found one presently and tom_sawyer said it was time to rest again both were cruelly tired yet becky_thatcher said she thought she could go a little farther
she was surprised to hear tom_sawyer dissent she could not understand it they sat down and tom_sawyer fastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay
thought was soon busy nothing was said for some time then becky_thatcher broke the silence tom_sawyer i am so hungry tom_sawyer took something out of his pocket
do you remember this said he becky_thatcher almost smiled it our wedding cake tom_sawyer yes i wish it was as big as a barrel for it all we ve got
i saved it from the picnic for us to dream on tom_sawyer the way grownup people do with wedding cake but it ll be our
she dropped the sentence where it was tom_sawyer divided the cake and becky_thatcher ate with good appetite while tom_sawyer nibbled at his moiety
there was abundance of cold water to finish the feast with by and by becky_thatcher suggested that they move on again tom_sawyer was silent a moment
then he said becky_thatcher can you bear it if i tell you something becky_thatcher face paled but she thought she could
well then becky_thatcher we must stay here where there water to drink that little piece is our last candle becky_thatcher gave loose to tears and wailings
tom_sawyer did what he could to comfort her but with little effect at length becky_thatcher said tom_sawyer well becky_thatcher
they ll miss us and hunt for us yes they will certainly they will maybe they re hunting for us now tom_sawyer
why i reckon maybe they are i hope they are when would they miss us tom_sawyer when they get back to the boat i reckon
tom_sawyer it might be dark then would they notice we hadnt come i dont know but anyway your mother would miss you as soon as they got home
a frightened look in becky_thatcher face brought tom_sawyer to his senses and he saw that he had made a blunder
in a moment a new burst of grief from becky_thatcher showed tom_sawyer that the thing in his mind had struck hers also that the sabbath morning might be half spent before mrs becky_thatcher discovered that becky_thatcher was not at mrs joe_harper
the children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watched it melt slowly and pitilessly away saw the half inch of wick stand alone at last saw the feeble flame rise and fall climb the thin column of smoke linger at its top a moment and then the horror of utter darkness reigned
how long afterward it was that becky_thatcher came to a slow consciousness that she was crying in tom_sawyer arms neither could tell
all that they knew was that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time both awoke out of a dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more
becky_thatcher was not to have gone home that night the children became silent and thoughtful tom_sawyer said it might be sunday now maybe monday
he tried to get becky_thatcher to talk but her sorrows were too oppressive all her hopes were gone tom_sawyer said that they must have been missed long ago and no doubt the search was going on
he would shout and maybe some one would come he tried it but in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that he tried it no more
the hours wasted away and hunger came to torment the captives again a portion of tom_sawyer half of the cake was left they divided and ate it
but they seemed hungrier than before the poor morsel of food only whetted desire by and by tom_sawyer said sh did you hear that
both held their breath and listened there was a sound like the faintest far off shout instantly tom_sawyer answered it and leading becky_thatcher by the hand started groping down the corridor in its direction
presently he listened again again the sound was heard and apparently a little nearer it them said tom_sawyer they re coming
come along becky_thatcher we re all right now the joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming their speed was slow however because pitfalls were somewhat common and had to be guarded against
they shortly came to one and had to stop it might be three feet deep it might be a hundred there was no passing it at any rate
tom_sawyer got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could no bottom they must stay there and wait until the searchers came
they listened evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant a moment or two more and they had gone altogether the heart sinking misery of it
tom_sawyer whooped until he was hoarse but it was of no use he talked hopefully to becky_thatcher but an age of anxious waiting passed and no sounds came again
the children groped their way back to the spring the weary time dragged on they slept again and awoke famished and woe stricken
tom_sawyer believed it must be tuesday by this time now an idea struck him there were some side passages near at hand
he took a kite line from his pocket tied it to a projection and he and becky_thatcher started tom_sawyer in the lead unwinding the line as he groped along
it would be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of the heavy time in idleness at the end of twenty steps the corridor ended in a jumping off place
tom_sawyer got down on his knees and felt below and then as far around the corner as he could reach with his hands conveniently he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to the right and at that moment not twenty yards away a human hand holding a candle appeared from behind a rock
tom_sawyer lifted up a glorious shout and instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to injun joe_harper tom_sawyer was paralyzed he could not move
he was vastly gratified the next moment to see the spaniard take to his heels and get himself out of sight
tom_sawyer wondered that joe_harper had not recognized his voice and come over and killed him for testifying in court but the echoes must have disguised the voice
he said to himself that if he had strength enough to get back to the spring he would stay there and nothing should tempt him to run the risk of meeting injun joe_harper again
without doubt that was it he reasoned tom_sawyer fright weakened every muscle in his body he was careful to keep from becky_thatcher what it was he had seen
he told her he had only shouted for luck but hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run
tom_sawyer believed that it must be wednesday or thursday or even friday or saturday now and that the search had been given over
another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep brought changes the children awoke tortured with a raging hunger he proposed to explore another passage
he felt willing to risk injun joe_harper and all other terrors but becky_thatcher was very weak she had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not be roused
she told tom_sawyer to go with the kite line and explore if he chose but she implored him to come back every little while and speak to her and she made him promise that when the awful time came he would stay by her and hold her hand until all was over
tom_sawyer kissed her with a choking sensation in his throat and made a show of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from the cave then he took the kite line in his hand and went groping down one of the passages on his hands and knees distressed with hunger and sick with bodings of coming doom
she said she would wait now where she was and die it would not be long chapter xxxii tuesday afternoon came and waned to the twilight
public prayers had been offered up for them and many and many a private prayer that had the petitioner whole heart in it but still no good news came from the cave
the majority of the searchers had given up the quest and gone back to their daily avocations saying that it was plain the children could never be found
the village of st petersburg still mourned the lost children had not been found mrs becky_thatcher was very ill and a great part of the time delirious
people said it was heartbreaking to hear her call her child and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time then lay it wearily down again with a moan
aunt_polly had drooped into a settled melancholy and her gray hair had grown almost white the village went to its rest on tuesday night sad and forlorn
away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village bells and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half clad people who shouted turn out
tin pans and horns were added to the din the population massed itself and moved toward the river met the children coming in an open carriage drawn by shouting citizens thronged around it joined its homeward march and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after huzzah
turn out they re found they re found the village was illuminated nobody went to bed again it was the greatest night the little town had ever seen
during the first half hour a procession of villagers filed through judge becky_thatcher house seized the saved ones and kissed them squeezed mrs becky_thatcher hand tried to speak but couldnt and drifted out raining tears all over the place
it would be complete however as soon as the messenger dispatched with the great news to the cave should get the word to her husband
tom_sawyer lay upon a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the wonderful adventure putting in many striking additions to adorn it withal and closed with a description of how he left becky_thatcher and went on an exploring expedition how he followed two avenues as far as his kite line would reach how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of the kite line and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far off speck that looked like daylight dropped the line and groped toward it pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole and saw the broad mississippi rolling by
and if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more
he told how he went back for becky_thatcher and broke the good news and she told him not to fret her with such stuff for she was tired and knew she was going to die and wanted to
he described how he labored with her and convinced her and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight how he pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out how they sat there and cried for gladness
how some men came along in a skiff and tom_sawyer hailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition how the men didnt believe the wild tale at first because said they you are five miles down the river below the valley
in then took them aboard rowed to a house gave them supper made them rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home
before day dawn judge becky_thatcher and the handful of searchers with him were tracked out in the cave by the twine clews they had strung behind them and informed of the great news
three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be shaken off at once as tom_sawyer and becky_thatcher soon discovered
they were bedridden all of wednesday and thursday and seemed to grow more and more tired and worn all the time
tom_sawyer got about a little on thursday was downtown friday and nearly as whole as ever saturday but becky_thatcher did not leave her room until sunday and then she looked as if she had passed through a wasting illness
tom_sawyer learned of huck_finn sickness and went to see him on friday but could not be admitted to the bedroom neither
aunt_polly happiness was complete and mrs becky_thatcher nearly so the cave is could he on saturday or sunday he was admitted daily after that but was warned to keep still about his adventure and introduce no exciting topic
at home tom_sawyer learned of the cardiff hill event also that the ragged man body had eventually been found in the river near the ferry landing he had been drowned while trying to escape perhaps
about a fortnight after tom_sawyer rescue from the cave he started off to visit huck_finn who had grown plenty strong enough now to hear exciting talk and tom_sawyer had some that would interest him he thought
the widow douglas stayed by to see that he obeyed judge becky_thatcher house was on tom_sawyer way and he stopped to see becky_thatcher
the judge and some friends set tom_sawyer to talking and some one asked him ironically if he wouldnt like to go to the cave again
tom_sawyer said he thought he wouldnt mind it the judge said well there are others just like you tom_sawyer i ve not the least doubt
but we have taken care of that nobody will get lost in that cave any more why because i had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks ago and triple locked and i ve got the keys
tom_sawyer turned as white as a sheet what the matter boy here run somebody fetch a glass of water
the water was brought and thrown into tom_sawyer face ah now you re all right what was the matter with you tom_sawyer
oh judge injun joe_harper in the cave chapter xxxiii within a few minute the news had spread and a dozen skiff
loads of men were on their way to mcdougal cave and the ferryboat well filled with passengers soon followed tom_sawyer was in the skiff that bore judge becky_thatcher
injun joe_harper lay stretched upon the ground dead with his face close to the crack of the door as if his longing eyes had been fixed to the latest moment upon the light and the cheer of the free world outside
when the cave door was unlocked a sorrowful sight presented itself in the dim twilight of the place tom_sawyer was touched for he knew by his own experience how this wretch had suffered
his pity was moved but nevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security now which revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciated before how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the day he lifted his voice against this bloody minded outcast
the great foundation beam of the door had been chipped and hacked through with tedious labor useless labor too it was for the native rock formed a sill outside it and upon that stubborn material the knife had wrought no effect the only damage done was to the knife itself
but if there had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have been useless still for if the beam had been wholly cut away
injun joe_harper bowie knife lay close by its blade broken in two injun joe_harper could not have squeezed his body under the door and he knew it
so he had only hacked that place in order to be doing something in order to pass the weary time in order to employ his tortured faculties
ordinarily one could find half a dozen bit of candle stuck around in the crevices of this vestibule left there by tourists but there were none now
the prisoner had searched them out and eaten them he had also contrived to catch a few bats and these also he had eaten leaving only their claws
in one place near at hand a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for ages builded by the water drip from a stalactite overhead
the captive had broken off the stalagmite and upon the stump had placed a stone wherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious drop that fell once in every three minute with the dreary regularity of a clock tick a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours
that drop was falling when the pyramids were new when troy fell when the foundations of rome were laid when christ was crucified when the conqueror created the british empire when columbus sailed when the massacre at lexington was news
it is falling now it will still be falling when all these thing shall have sunk down the afternoon of history and the twilight of tradition and been swallowed up in the thick night of oblivion
the poor unfortunate had starved to death has everything a purpose and a mission did this drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready for this flitting human insect need
it is many and many a year since the hapless half breed scooped out the stone to catch the priceless drops but to this day the tourist stares longest at that pathetic stone and that slow dropping water when he comes to see the wonders of mcdougal cave
and has it another important object to accomplish ten thousand years to come no matter injun joe_harper cup stands first in the list of the cavern marvels even aladdin palace cannot rival it
injun joe_harper was buried near the mouth of the cave and people flocked there in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms and hamlets for seven miles around they brought their children and all sorts of provisions and confessed that they had had almost as satisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at the hanging
the petition had been largely signed many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held and a committee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wail around the governor and implore him to be a merciful ass and trample his duty under foot
this funeral stopped the further growth of one thing the petition to the governor for injun joe_harper pardon injun joe_harper was believed to have killed five citizens of the village but what of that
if he had been satan himself there would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a pardon petition and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired and leaky water works
huck_finn had learned all about tom_sawyer adventure from the welshman and the widow douglas by this time but tom_sawyer said he reckoned there was one thing they had not told him that thing was what he wanted to talk about now
the morning after the funeral tom_sawyer took huck_finn to a private place to have an important talk huck_finn face saddened he said i know what it is
nobody told me it was you but i just knowed it must a ben_rogers you soon as i heard bout that whiskey business and i knowed you hadnt got the money becuz
you got into no and never found anything but whiskey you a got at me some way or other and told me even if you was mum to everybody else
tom_sawyer something always told me we never get holt of that swag why huck_finn i never told on that tavern keeper you know his tavern was all right
the saturday i went to the picnic dont you remember you was to watch there that night oh yes why it seems bout a year ago
it was that very night that i follered injun joe_harper to the widder you followed him yes but you keep mum
i reckon injun joe_harper left friends behind him and i dont want em souring on me and doing me mean tricks
then huck_finn told his entire adventure in confidence to tom_sawyer who had only heard of the welshman part of it before
well said huck_finn presently coming back to the main question whoever nipped the whiskey in no nipped the money too i reckon anyways it a goner for us tom_sawyer
if it hadnt ben_rogers for me he be down in texas now all right huck_finn that money wasnt ever in no
what huck_finn searched his comrade face keenly tom_sawyer have you got on the track of that money again huck_finn it in the cave
huck_finn eyes blazed say it again tom_sawyer the money in the cave tom_sawyer honest injun now is it fun or earnest earnest huck_finn just as earnest as ever i was in my life
will you go in there with me and help get it out i bet i will i will if it where we can blaze our way to it and not get lost
huck_finn we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in the world good as wheat what makes you think the
money huck_finn you just wait till we get in there if we dont find it i ll agree to give you my drum and every thing i ve got in the world
i will by jings all right it a whiz when do you say right now if you say it
are you strong enough is it far in the cave i ben_rogers on my pins a little three or four days now but i cant walk more a mile tom_sawyer
least i dont think i could it about five mile into there the way anybody but me would go huck_finn but there a mighty short cut that they dont anybody
but me know about huck_finn i ll take you right to it in a skiff i ll float the skiff down there and i ll pull it back again all by myself
we want some bread and meat and our pipes and a little bag or two and two or three kite strings and some of these new fangled thing they call lucifer matches
you neednt ever turn your hand over less start right off tom_sawyer all right i tell you many the time i wished i had some when i was in there before
a trifle after noon the boy borrowed a small skiff from a citizen who was absent and got under way at once
when they were several miles below cave hollow tom_sawyer said now you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from the cave hollow no houses no wood yards bushes all alike
but do you see that white place up yonder where there been a landslide well that one of my marks
we ll get ashore now they landed now huck_finn where we re a standing you could touch that hole i got out of with a fishing pole
see if you can find it huck_finn searched all the place about and found nothing tom_sawyer proudly marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said here you are
all along i ve been wanting to be a robber but i knew i got to have a thing like this and where to run across it was the bother
we ve got it now and we ll keep it quiet only we ll let joe_harper and ben_rogers in because of course there got to be a gang or else there wouldnt be any style about it
look at it huck_finn it the snuggest hole in this country you just keep mum about it tom_sawyer gang
it sounds splendid dont it huck_finn well it just does tom_sawyer and who ll we rob oh most anybody waylay people that mostly the way
and kill them no not always hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom what a ransom
you make them raise all they can off their friends and after you ve kept them a year if it aint raised then you kill them
money that the general way only you dont kill the women you shut up the women but you dont kill them
they re always beautiful and rich and awfully scared you take their watches and thing but you always take your hat off and talk polite
they aint anybody as polite as robbers you ll see that in any book well the women get to loving you and after they ve been in the cave
a week or two weeks they stop crying and after that you couldnt get them to leave if you drove them out they turn right around and come back
it so in all the books why it real bully tom_sawyer i believe it better to be a pirate
yes it better in some way because it close to home and circuses and all that by this time everything was ready and the boy entered the hole tom_sawyer in the lead
they toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnel then made their spliced kite strings fast and moved on a few steps brought them to the spring and tom_sawyer felt a shudder quiver all through him
he showed huck_finn the fragment of candle wick perched on a lump of clay against the wall and described how he and becky_thatcher had watched the flame struggle and expire
the boy began to quiet down to whispers now for the stillness and gloom of the place oppressed their spirits they went on and presently entered and followed tom_sawyer other corridor until they reached the jumping off place
the candles revealed the fact that it was not really a precipice but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feet high
tom_sawyer whispered now i ll show you something huck_finn he held his candle aloft and said look as far around the corner as you can
do you see that there on the big rock over yonder done with candle smoke tom_sawyer it a cross now where your number two
under the cross hey right yonder where i saw injun joe_harper poke up his candle huck_finn huck_finn stared at the mystic sign awhile and then said with a shaky voice tom_sawyer less git out of here
what and leave the treasure yes leave it injun joe_harper ghost is round about there certain no it aint huck_finn no it aint
it would ha nt the place where he died away out at the mouth of the cave five mile from here no tom_sawyer it wouldnt
it would hang round the money i know the way of ghosts and so do you tom_sawyer began to fear that huck_finn was right
mis givings gathered in his mind but presently an idea occurred to him lookyhere huck_finn what fools we re making of ourselves injun joe_harper ghost aint a going to come around where there a cross
the point was well taken it had its effect tom_sawyer i didnt think of that but that so it luck for us that cross is
i reckon we ll climb down there and have a hunt for that box tom_sawyer went first cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended
huck_finn followed four avenues opened out of the small cavern which the great rock stood in the boy examined three of them with no result
they found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock with a pallet of blankets spread down in it also an old suspender some bacon rind and the well gnawed bones of two or three fowls
but there was no moneybox the lads searched and researched this place but in vain tom_sawyer said he said under the cross
well this comes nearest to being under the cross it cant be under the rock itself because that sets solid on the ground
by and by tom_sawyer said lookyhere huck_finn there footprints and some candle grease on the clay about one side of this rock but not on the other sides
they searched everywhere once more and then sat down discouraged huck_finn could suggest nothing now what that for i bet you the money is under the rock
i going to dig in the clay that aint no bad notion tom_sawyer said huck_finn with animation tom_sawyer real barlow was out at once and he had not dug four inches before he struck wood
hey huck_finn you hear that huck_finn began to dig and scratch now some boards were soon uncovered and removed they had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock
tom_sawyer got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as he could but said he could not see to the end of the rift
he proposed to explore he stooped and passed under the narrow way descended gradually he followed its winding course first to the right then to the left huck_finn at his heels
it was the treasure box sure enough occupying a snug little cavern along with an empty powder keg a couple of guns in leather cases two or three pairs of old moccasins a leather belt and some other rubbish well soaked with the water drip
tom_sawyer turned a short curve by and by and exclaimed my goodness huck_finn lookyhere got it at last said huck_finn ploughing among the tarnished coins with his hand
my but we re rich tom_sawyer huck_finn i always reckoned we get it it just too good to believe but we have got it sure
say let not fool around here let snake it out lemme see if i can lift the box it weighed about fifty pounds
tom_sawyer could lift it after an awkward fashion but could not carry it conveniently i thought so he said they carried it like it was heavy that day at the ha nted house
i noticed that i reckon i was right to think of fetching the little bags along the money was soon in the bags and the boy took it up to the cross rock
now less fetch the guns and thing said huck_finn no huck_finn leave them there they re just the tricks to have when we go to robbing
we ll keep them there all the time and we ll hold our orgies there too it an awful snug place for orgies
what orgies i dono but robbers always have orgies and of course we ve got to have them too come along huck_finn we ve been in here a long time
they presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes looked warily out found the coast clear and were soon lunching and smoking in the skiff
it getting late i reckon i hungry too we ll eat and smoke when we get to the skiff as the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and got under way
now huck_finn said tom_sawyer we ll hide the money in the loft of the widow woodshed and i ll come up in the morning and we ll count it and divide and then we ll hunt up a place out in the woods for it where it will be safe
just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff till i run and hook benny taylor little wagon i wont be gone a minute
he disappeared and presently returned with the wagon put the two small sacks into it threw some old rags on top of them and started off dragging his cargo behind him
tom_sawyer skimmed up the shore through the long twilight chatting cheerily with huck_finn and landed shortly after dark when the boy reached the welshman house they stopped to rest
just as they were about to move on the welshman stepped out and said hallo who that huck_finn and tom_sawyer
good come along with me boy you are keeping everybody waiting here hurry up trot ahead i ll haul the wagon for you why it not as light as it might be
i judged so the boy in this town will take more trouble and fool away more time hunting up six bit worth of old iron to sell to the foundry than they would to make twice the money at regular work
got bricks in it or old metal old metal said tom_sawyer but that human nature hurry along hurry along the boy wanted to know what the hurry was about
never mind you ll see when we get to the widow douglas huck_finn said with some apprehension for he was long used to being falsely accused mr_jones we havent been doing nothing
the welshman laughed well i dont know huck_finn my boy i dont know about that aint you and the widow good friends
yes well she ben_rogers good friends to me anyway all right then what do you want to be afraid for
this question was not entirely answered in huck_finn slow mind before he found himself pushed along with tom_sawyer into mrs douglas drawing room
mr_jones left the wagon near the door and followed the place was grandly lighted and everybody that was of any consequence in the village was there
the thatchers were there the harpers the rogerses aunt_polly sid mary the minister the editor and a great many more and all dressed in their best
the widow received the boy as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings they were covered with clay and candle grease
aunt_polly blushed crimson with humiliation and frowned and shook her head at tom_sawyer nobody suffered half as much as the two boy did however
mr_jones said tom_sawyer wasnt at home yet so i gave him up but i stumbled on him and huck_finn right at my door and so i just brought them along in a hurry
and you did just right said the widow come with me boy she took them to a bedchamber and said now wash and dress yourselves
here are two new suits of clothes shirts socks everything complete they re huck_finn no no thanks huck_finn mr_jones bought one and i the other
but they ll fit both of you get into them we ll wait come down when you are slicked up enough then she left
chapter xxxiv huck_finn said tom_sawyer we can slope if we can find a rope the window aint high from the ground
shucks what do you want to slope for well i aint used to that kind of a crowd i cant stand it
i aint going down there tom_sawyer oh bother it aint anything i dont mind it a bit i ll take care of you
sid appeared tom_sawyer said he auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon mary got your sunday clothes ready and everybody been fretting about you
say aint this grease and clay on your clothes now mr siddy you jist tend to your own business what all this blowout about anyway
this time it for the welshman and his sons on account of that scrape they helped her out of the other night
it one of the widow parties that she always having and say i can tell you something if you want to know
why old mr_jones is going to try to spring something on the people here tonight but i overheard him tell auntie today about it as a secret but i reckon it not much of a secret now
well what everybody knows the widow too for all she tries to let on she dont mr_jones was bound huck_finn should be here
couldnt get along with his grand secret without huck_finn you know secret about what sid about huck_finn tracking the robbers to the widow
i reckon mr_jones was going to make a grand time over his surprise but i bet you it will drop pretty flat
sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way sid was it you that told oh never mind who it was
somebody told that enough sid there only one person in this town mean enough to do that and that you if you had been in huck_finn place
you a sneaked down the hill and never told anybody on the robbers you cant do any but mean thing and you cant bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones
there no thanks as the widow says and tom_sawyer cuffed sid ears and helped him to the door with several kicks now go and tell auntie if you dare and tomorrow you ll catch it
some minute later the widow guests were at the supper table and a dozen children were propped up at little side tables in the same room after the fashion of that country and that day
at the proper time mr_jones made his little speech in which he thanked the widow for the honor she was doing himself and his sons but said that there was another person whose modesty
he sprung his secret about huck_finn share in the adventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of but the surprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous and effusive as it might have been under happier circumstances
however the widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment and heaped so many compliments and so much gratitude upon huck_finn that he almost forgot the nearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirely intolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybody gaze and everybody laudations
the widow said she meant to give huck_finn a home under her roof and have him educated and that when she could spare the money she would start him in business in a modest way
nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke
and so forth and so on tom_sawyer chance was come he said huck_finn dont need it huck_finn rich but the silence was a little awkward
tom_sawyer broke it huck_finn got money maybe you dont believe it but he got lots of it oh you neednt smile
i reckon i can show you you just wait a minute tom_sawyer ran out of doors the company looked at each other with a perplexed interest and inquiringly at huck_finn who was tongue tied
sid what ails tom_sawyer said aunt_polly he well there aint ever any making of that boy out i never
tom_sawyer entered struggling with the weight of his sacks and aunt_polly did not finish her sentence tom_sawyer poured the mass of yellow coin upon the table and said there what did i tell you
half of it huck_finn and half of it mine the spectacle took the general breath away all gazed nobody spoke for a moment
then there was a unanimous call for an explanation tom_sawyer said he could furnish it and he did the tale was long but brimful of interest
when he had finished mr_jones said i thought i had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion but it dont amount to anything now
there was scarcely an interruption from any one to break the charm of its flow this one makes it sing mighty small i willing to allow
it was more than any one present had ever seen at one time before though several persons were there who were worth considerably more than that in property
chapter xxxv the reader may rest satisfied that tom_sawyer and huck_finn windfall made a mighty stir in the poor little village of st petersburg
the money was counted the sum amounted to a little over twelve thousand dollars so vast a sum all in actual cash seemed next to incredible
it was talked about gloated over glorified until the reason of many of the citizens tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement
every haunted house in st petersburg and the neighboring villages was dissected plank by plank and its foundations dug up and ransacked for hidden treasure and not by boy but men pretty grave unromantic men too some of them
the boy were not able to remember that their remarks had possessed weight before but now their sayings were treasured and repeated everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as remarkable they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying commonplace thing moreover their past history was raked up and discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality
the widow douglas put huck_finn money out at six per cent and judge becky_thatcher did the same with tom_sawyer at aunt_polly request
each lad had an income now that was simply prodigious a dollar for every weekday in the year and half of the sundays
wherever tom_sawyer and huck_finn appeared they were courted admired stared at the village paper published biographical sketches of the boy it was just what the minister got no it was what he was promised he generally couldnt collect it
a dollar and a quarter a week would board lodge and school a boy in those old simple days and clothe him and wash him too for that matter
judge becky_thatcher had conceived a great opinion of tom_sawyer he said that no commonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave
when becky_thatcher told her father in strict confidence how tom_sawyer had taken her whipping at school the judge was visibly moved and when she pleaded grace for the mighty lie which tom_sawyer had told in order to shift that whipping from her shoulders to his own the judge said with a fine outburst that it was a noble a generous a magnanimous lie a lie that was worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast to breast with george washington lauded truth about the hatchet
becky_thatcher thought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when he walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that
she went straight off and told tom_sawyer about it judge becky_thatcher hoped to see tom_sawyer a great lawyer or a great soldier some day
he said he meant to look to it that tom_sawyer should be admitted to the national military academy and afterward trained in the best law school in the country in order that he might be ready for either career or both
huck_finn wealth and the fact that he was now under the widow douglas protection introduced him into society no dragged him into it hurled him into it and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear
the widow servants kept him clean and neat combed and brushed and they bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend
he had to eat with a knife and fork he had to use napkin cup and plate he had to learn his book he had to go to church he had to talk so properly that speech was become insipid in his mouth whithersoever he turned the bars and shackles of civilization shut him in and bound him hand and foot
he bravely bore his miseries three weeks and then one day turned up missing for forty eight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere in great distress
early the third morning tom_sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheads down behind the abandoned slaughter house and in one of them he found the refugee
huck_finn had slept there he had just breakfasted upon some stolen odds and ends of food and was lying off now in comfort with his pipe
he was unkempt uncombed and clad in the same old ruin of rags that had made him picturesque in the days when he was free and happy
the public were profoundly concerned they searched high and low they dragged the river for his body tom_sawyer routed him out told him the trouble he had been causing and urged him to go home
huck_finn face lost its tranquil content and took a melancholy cast he said dont talk about it tom_sawyer i ve tried it and it dont work it dont work tom_sawyer
it aint for me i aint used to it the widder good to me and friendly but i cant stand them way
she makes me get up just at the same time every morning she makes me wash they comb me all to thunder she wont let me sleep in the woodshed i got to wear them blamed clothes that just smothers me

the widder wouldnt let me smoke she wouldnt let me yell she wouldnt let me gape nor stretch nor scratch before folks
then with a spasm of special irritation and injury and dad fetch it she prayed all the time i never see such a woman
i had to shove tom_sawyer i just had to and besides that school going to open and i a had to go to it
well i wouldnt stand that tom_sawyer looky here tom_sawyer being rich aint what it cracked up to be it just worry and worry and sweat and sweat and a wishing

just as we got guns and a cave and all just fixed to rob here this dern foolishness has got to come up and spile it all
blame it all tom_sawyer saw his opportunity lookyhere huck_finn being rich aint going to keep me back from turning robber
no oh good licks are you in real dead wood earnest tom_sawyer just as dead earnest as i sitting here but huck_finn we cant let you into the gang if you aint respectable you know
huck_finn joy was quenched cant let me in tom_sawyer didnt you let me go for a pirate yes but that different
a robber is more high toned than what a pirate is as a general thing in most countries they re awful high up in the nobility dukes and such
now tom_sawyer haint you always ben_rogers friendly to me you wouldnt shet me out would you tom_sawyer you wouldnt do that now would you tom_sawyer
huck_finn i wouldnt want to and i dont want to but what would people say why they say mph tom_sawyer gang
pretty low characters in it they mean you huck_finn you wouldnt like that and i wouldnt huck_finn was silent for some time engaged in a mental struggle
finally he said well i ll go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see if i can come to stand it if you ll let me long to the gang tom_sawyer
all right huck_finn it a whiz come along old chap and i ll ask the widow to let up on you a little huck_finn

it to swear to stand by one another and never tell the gang secrets even if you re chopped all to flinders and kill anybody and all his family that hurts one of the gang

that gay that mighty gay tom_sawyer i tell you well i bet it is well midnight good anyway tom_sawyer
yes so it is and you ve got to swear on a coffin and sign it with blood now that something like
if i git to be a reg lar ripper of a robber and everybody talking bout it i reckon she ll be proud
why it a million time bullier than pirating i ll stick to the widder till i rot tom_sawyer and she snaked me in out of the wet
it being strictly a history of a boy it must stop here the story could not go much further without becoming the history of a man
when one writes a novel about grown people he knows exactly where to stop that is with a marriage but when he writes of juveniles he must stop where he best can
conclusion so endeth this chronicle most of the characters that perform in this book still live and are prosperous and happy
some day it may seem worth while to take up the story of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women they turned out to be therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of that part of their life at present
